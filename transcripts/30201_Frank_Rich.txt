Frank Rich is a senior theater critic of The New York Times and has followed Joe Papp's career for years. Welcome, I thank you very much for coming here. 

Thank you for having me. 

Legend, most important creative force in the theater. All of those things have been said about him. Give me a sense of how you see his contribution to the American theater and what we were -- what we have lost, with his passing. 

The loss is enormous and it's not only a loss for the American theater but also for New York city because what he did was a part of the city's life as well as the whole theater's life. The great shows he did, the familiar titles, we all know, starting with 'A Chorus Line', the actors that became stars, the playwrights who became successful under his leadership. That doesn't really tell the story. He really was the principal mover in a revolution that completely changed the way theater is produced in this country. In 1956, which was the year that he began Shakespeare in the Park, although not yet in Central Park, and he was just a scrappy guy starting out, fighting city authorities and everything else. Broadway theater was it in this country. Broadway created the big plays and musicals and they were disseminated throughout the United States by road companies or through stock companies. There was the beginnings of a -- strong beginnings of an off-Broadway movement and a regional movement but it hadn't really coalesced yet. What he basically did was he took the creative power away from Broadway and said that here in a non-profit theater, where the artists are respected more than the buck. Artists can flourish, create great plays and musicals and then we'll let Broadway take them and -- 

Perhaps we'll bring them to Broadway. 

Right. That wasn't his motive to become a successful Broadway producer but just a byproduct, but what he did was he took the process by which plays are developed and by which careers are developed in the theater, whether actors, directors or playwrights, he took it out of that hurly burly commercial arena to -- he created this home downtown in Greenwich Village at the Public Theater where art could flourish. And then as it happened, the art was so good, it turned out to have a mass following and ultimately, he and people like him and other off-Broadway companies and around the country at regional theaters took over the whole creative -- 

So by what he did, he changed the power balance. 

Totally, I mean, the very first show he produced indoors at the public was 'Hair', which was considered an outrageous idea before he did it, and then it was moved to Broadway and it turned out to run almost as long as 'South Pacific', and then he was able to do this with even more adventurous works, and of course, not just musicals. 

You once wrote that what Broadway needs and what the theater needs are great producers, impresarios, and you Joe Papp embodied all the qualities. What did he embody? What qualities made him an extraordinary producer? 

An extraordinary producer is -- it's done with smoke and mirrors. It's not something you can even quantify. He's not a writer, he's not an actor. He was a director but not a great director. He has an instinct for art, for what makes good art. He has an instinct for what the public likes. He has ability to bring those two forces and together and he an ability, as much as one hates to say it, to sell his stuff but also, it was great. I mean, he knew how to bring artists together to create exciting things and over an enormous range of artists. On one hand, Michael Bennett, on the other hand, Vaclav Havel -- 

And he could work with the whole range of those kind of people and attract and understand who could really make a contribution who had the talent to change. 

Yes, but what made him all the more remarkable was unlike equivalent great producers, whether on Broadway or in Hollywood or in television, he also had a social vision. He didn't just have this great skill at producing terrific work. He also had an idealism, an idealism about bringing free Shakespeare to the public, about multi-racial casting, about political agenda, about certain kinds of plays he wanted to do, and very broad taste from avant-garde to the most mass kind of a theatrical -- 

He encouraged people like David Mamet and people who were writing plays that were up against the establishment as a distinctive contribution. 

Yes, and he never stopped doing that, even though at a certain point, like all successful people, he was the establishment. Anyone who produced 'A Chorus Line' became the establishment, but right until the end, right until the point of his successor, JoAnne Akalaitis, he supported experimental work, even as -- he'd have his eye occasionally on the main chance, a big musical or whatever. 

Would he acknowledge that, that he understood the commercialism of the business and how that had a role to play? 

I guess he would, but interestingly, again, this separates him from most other producers, his motives weren't really commercial. He loved the theater and he wanted his theater to flourish and he wanted the New York theater, I think, to flourish, but he was never in it for personal gain. He was never in it to make a buck, and so he had an instinct for that, but it really wasn't what drove him. There's no evidence suggested that's what drove him. 

You obviously didn't love everything he did. 

No, far from it. A critic's job is to call him on it and all critics did, and he'd fight with us -- 

And how would he fight back? I mean, he would respond. I mean, there was one -- I read one piece where he grab John Simon by the tie or something? 

I missed that one but he's certainly -- one of my predecessors, he bodily threw out of the theater. He's yelled at me in the lobby, called me up on the phone and screamed. I'm not an intimate of his and it comes with a job. The thing is that he cared. He cared enough to fight, and he didn't just fight critics. He fought Robert Moses, He fought mayors of New York City. He fought (crosstalk) -- 

National Endowment For the Arts. 

Corporations for the endowment, he fought McCarthy in the '50s. He fought >>CBS when they delayed Vietnam -- an anti-Vietnam play he wanted to air. He was a fighter and he won. Charlie Rose: Did he change over the years? Was there an evolution in Joe Papp in terms of what he did and how he saw the theater or was it always this singular pursuit of the best in theater and the new avant-garde? It's interesting. It did -- his views didn't really change but program became a lot larger. When he was beginning, he was just concerned with putting on Shakespeare but from the very beginning, he believed in multi-racial casting. He didn't believe in productions that were as adventurous as the ones would come, but the theater didn't know about that yet in this country and it's just that he expanded. So the philosophy was the same, but it was a much narrower producing organization in the early years before they moved indoors and before he had all these stages to work with. 

I think he ended up with, what, a budget of $14 -- I think I read somewhere $15 million and -- or maybe more and 100 people and something like that? 

Yea, I don't know those figures, but remember, he just had one stage in the park, and then we moved in, he ultimately had six stages indoors. 

He once said, and I was struck by this quote. He said, "I realized that my dignity as a person exists within the Shakespeare Festival. To keep myself alive, I have to keep the Festival alive." It says a lot about him. 

It says that -- this is a man who really loved the theater and believed in the theater and found expression in it and humane expression, if that. 

Did you get to know him any better near the end of his life? 

I had several conversations with him in the past few months of just a personal nature and they were on the phone. 

With that -- 

I'm not a friend of his or an intimate of his. 

Without it violating your own privacy in those conversations, did he have some sense of his own posterity, his place? Did he talk about that? 

He was really, I think, to the extent that I had contact with him, really concerned with the day-to-day events of his life. He was fighting an illness. He had other tragedy in his family and yet he did talk about the theater and his affection for the theater and his feeling about the world. He was not -- certainly, at least not to me, he wasn't writhing his own tributes or anything of the sort. Other than the -- 

He was an autocrat, too. I mean, he was a man who wanted his decision to be the decision. It wasn't a decision that he believed -- 

Great producers all have that in common. Great producer do not happen by committee, and at the same time, he enabled -- I mean, one of his legacies is that he enabled so much talent to flourish, both playwrights, directors, and the actors, people like Kevin Kline and others who performed (crosstalk) -- George C. Scott, James Earl Jones, Colleen Dewhurst, all these people at the beginning of their careers and such a wide variety of writers. I mean, a writer like Caryl Churchill has very little in common with George C. Wolfe was very little in common with Jason Miller. One could go on and on. 

He's clearly irreplaceable but Shakespeare Festival continues. Other things that he was associated with continue, but the loss and you worry about the fact that great giant producers are becoming extinct. 

It's hard partially because of the collapse of the old commercial system. There's no real apparatus or producing them and he came at out of another world. He was 70 years old. He grew up in a world we don't live in now, a world before television was the theater itself occupied a more prominent role. And it just -- 

One of my favorite stories about him has been he's saying that when you said where he grew up, grew up in Brooklyn. His father, I think -- I'm not sure I remember, but his father, I think, an immigrant. It's Papirofsky -- 

I assumed -- I think it was a -- 

And he went back to, I guess, at somewhere in Brooklyn, they had a thing in which they had put Joe Papp and he paid himself because it was Brooklyn. He said, "In Brooklyn, I'm Papirofsky. I'm not Joe Papp." And he paid $200 or so to change this little concrete to get it done. Of all his work, of all his plays, do you have a favorite that would be sort of a defining Joe Papp production for you, beyond Shakespeare and the Shakespeare Festival and Shakespeare in the Park? 

Not really. I think the very definition of Joe Papp, what made him so special is that there can -- by definition, there can never be a defining Joe Papp production because -- 

Because it was so diverse. 

Because his -- he was interest -- he was one of those people who was interested in everything so you could see a play with two light bulbs talking to each other, literally, all the way to 'A Chorus Line'. And what marked him was his endless curiosity for all things theatrical and all kinds of writers. 

And loved the theater more. I mean, what's intriguing to me, he was called Mister Showbiz during the war, because of some production he did during war. 

He did stateside production variety acts and service and emceed them. He was something of a ham who loved to speak at public occasions and did the (inaudible) in the late '70s. 

Why did he do that? I've -- I guess it was just being a ham and loving the whole sense of theater that he wanted to do, who was kind of a top hat thing he would -- 

Yea, he's this amazing combination of the old fashion and new fashion. He smoked a cigar. He promoted himself on occasion and yet, on the other hand, he was doing all this sort of new and modern work. 

When he talked about actors, he respected actors. I mean, it seemed to me, one of the conversations I had with him in Washington, it was always -- he said, "I create plays for actors, most of all." Is that unique? Is that distinctive? 

That's not unique in the theater certainly. Many people feel this way. He, however, did make it more of a cause than most and of course, that symbolized most 'A Chorus Line', which surely must have appealed to him at least in part because it was about the anonymous foot soldier performers whom he loved and whose stories he wanted to get to the public. 

Frank, we just thank you for joining at a time like this and remembering a man who clearly was a legend and who left an indelible mark, as you say, not only on American theater but on this city and for someone who came from the roots he had, made such an impact on culture here and made such a contribution to the richness of so many of our lives because of what he, with a single-handed force, was able to bring to us. Thank you very much. When we talk -- when we come back, we'll talk to veteran
