President Trump will meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort this Thursday and Friday. It is the first meeting between the two world leaders and is seen as an important step in U.S.-China relations. They're expected to address such issues as North Korea, global trade, the One China policy and climate change. Joining me to talk about this highly anticipated summit is Kevin Rudd. He was the prime minister of Australia from 2007 to 2010, and again in 2013. He now serves as the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. I'm pleased to have him back on this program. What might these two countries expect? And what is the context they come to Florida? 

Well, let's start with the Chinese because a lot of people watching your program will have an idea about what might be on President Trump's mind, but international politics is about the sound of two hands clapping, not just one. So if you're in Beijing, and you're preparing for this visit, what's on your mind if you're President Xi Jinping? I think the big factor in the back of President Xi's mind is that he's got a big election coming up this year. It's not a democracy, China, everyone knows that. But an internal election within the communist party of some 86, 88 million members, and, again, that's not a democracy either but it's intense politics about who will now join Xi Jinping and the politburo and the politburo standing committee for the next five years. So this is a big deal. 

Seven members of the standing committee really rule of China. 

It's kind of like the standing cabinet, weekly meeting, a table probably a little larger than yours here, Charlie, but they have submissions and they basically run the government of the country. So what he would like this year, 2017, to be about is a quiet year internationally because he's got a lot on domestically. Then there's, I think, the other thing on his mind is the economy. China's economy is not doing too bad. It was widely criticized the last couple of years but growth is reasonable, around 6 percent, maybe a bit stronger in the year ahead as the global economy starts to recover. But he also doesn't want any bad economic news either. And there's a reason for that going into the party congress where he's going to maximize his political authority to get the personnel up into new positions that he wants. He doesn't want economic bad news either, like a trade war with the United States. That would be bad news from his perspective. So I think he'd come to Mar-a-Lago with a view that, look, let's try to calm things down a bit, let's try to manage this relationship as rationally as we can, and let's just see how we go about responding to what's top of the mind to the U.S. president. 

One of the things you wrote -- which amazed me and I would assume that it might very well be true because it matched something from history -- was the Chinese and the Chinese leadership, they're kind of looking at Donald Trump with a certain amount of admiration because they know what he did in this surprising election and, as politicians, you were one? 

Yes. Well, the Chinese at the end of the day are realists. I mean, they stopped trying to export revolution back just after the cultural revolution in the late '70s. That was the end of that. So when they observed western politics at play, particularly in this country, which is the most powerful country in the world, the United States, anyone who wins a presidential election, from their point of view, is someone to be respected. Secondly, when you've come from totally outside the mainstream, like President Trump has, including outside the mainstream of the Republican Party, they are, I think, more respectful and certainly fascinated as to, how did he pull this off? 

It reminds me, it is said that Gorbachev had some of the same feelings about Reagan who he grew to like and have relationships with, but he couldn't quite understand this relationship Reagan had with the American people. 

Yes, and, I mean, I wasn't in the United States at the time, but I certainly -- you know, the whole story of the Reagan Democrats, et cetera, I mean, this was a palpable phenomenon in this country. President Trump, obviously, is vastly different. 

From Ronald Reagan, absolutely. 

And I'm just talking about this from a Chinese perspective. So I don't come here with a view that President Trump's illegitimate or anything like that. He's the president of the United States of America, he's the person they're required to deal with, and there are serious questions of trade, investment, North Korea, South China Sea on the agenda, but it will also be an opportunity for these two leaders just to start getting a measure of each other, start the getting to know you. In politics, Charlie, and you're the seasoned veteran here, my friend, politics and international politics, at the end of the day, ain't all that complicated. It's about folks, it's about people, it's about relationships and it's -- to some extent, it's about national interests, and to some extent it's about whether I can do business with you and whether I like you. Whether I've got some respect for you. So I think that's why, first up, all other results to one side of Mar-a-Lago, the fact that, early in President Trump's administration, he's spending a day and a half or whatever it is with the Chinese president, I think is a good thing. It's a good thing that President Xi has decided to make the trip over as well. 

Clearly, Trump, the president, will make the case, as he has articulated during the campaign, during the transition and since, you know, that he thinks China, that they're not playing on a level playing field. You know, he made that argument, and that was a central part of his campaign. Does he have a point? 

Absolutely. And -- well, you simply look at the scope of the bilateral trade deficit. China exports here just a little under half a trillion dollars a year. The United States sells to the Chinese a little over $100 billion a year. So it's a handy trade surplus for the Chinese. 

Looking at $300 billion. 

It's $350 billion in 2016. So, I think the Chinese in their heart of hearts and their minds of minds know that if it was them, this should be narrowed. So I think there is an opportunity for a discussion about this. The second thing is, as I said before, the Chinese are ultimately political realists as well, and they know that this has been central to President Trump's domestic election campaign. They've seen all the stuff about China. They've analyzed it a thousand times over. 

And they have seen the people he has appointed. 

Yes. 

For example, his trade negotiator. 

Yes. Well, the trade and economics side of the house in the White House, a number of the key personnel are decisively skeptical about China. Some would say decisively negative, given the benefit of the doubt, and say decisively skeptical. But what I'm saying is that even the Chinese coming into this meeting have figured it out that when President Trump has said the American middle class has lost its standing as we've helped create a middle class in China, or blamed -- 

And that in fact, is a line that he uses. 

That's right. And my Chinese friends actually explained this is where he's coming from, this is part of the reason he picked up that huge sway of votes out there between one coast and the other. And that, when he says that American cities, American towns, American industries, American jobs are fading away because new cities and new jobs and new industries have been created in China because of the trade, whatever you think of the trade policy logic of the statement, that's his deep view. So going back to Mar-a-Lago, the Chinese know that as well. So I think there is an opportunity for some progress to happen on the trade front in particular. 

How about South China, those islands? 

Yes. 

Any possibility that the Chinese -- the Chinese seem to me, and you've been there recently, you know, they seem to be deepening their commitment. It's not just the United States, other Pacific nations have a stake there, but they seem to be showing no likelihood to pull back. 

I think that's a right call, Charlie. If there were anything else, I would tell you, but I don't think it is. I go there a lot. But the question is though, how is it now handled? From one point of view, the Chinese, in the last several years, have reclaimed three or four islands. They've fortified them. And it may well be that the opportunity now exists to actually take the temperature down. You see, China does not want a war with the United States. There is a big reason for that. I think the realists in Beijing would work out that given the still the overwhelming power of the United States Pacific fleet, the United States would prevail in a limited engagement in the South China Sea. So the Chinese would not want to lose any such engagement and they certainly, therefore, don't want conflict by accident by one ship running into another in the middle of the night as one tails the other or aircraft doing the same. So for those reasons, I think there may be some appetite on China's part to say, well, let's just take the temperature down, maybe even decrease our deployments both sides, if that can be arranged, make sure that our rules of engagement are such that you don't have one rule of engagement taking a vessel that way and another one from the other navy going this way. Because you know what happens when you have a crash up there or on the water, escalation politics takes in, national pride takes over. How many times have we seen this in history? 

And that's really the thing, other than North Korea, there have been a number of instances in the last year or two having to do with Iran and the United States, having to do with Russia and the United States, you know, where there've been sort of challenges on the seas. 

Certainly seen those in the Gulf. And you've seen that with various air maneuvers, air force maneuvers by the Russian air force. 

And all is necessary is to have a mistake and one side or the other kills a series of soldiers of the other side. 

That's right. And then you have, you know, this sorry history that we know from international relations history of escalation politics, where suddenly a whole bunch of other factors start playing in in terms of how it's portrayed in each other's domestic media, et cetera. So the key science, I think, for the period ahead leaving aside the intrinsic issues of conflicting claims to the South China Sea itself is, how do you de-escalate in a way which preserves the status quo and minimizes the risk of kind of conflict by accident? 

Brings me to North Korea. You saw what the president said over the weekend to the Financial Times. 

It was subtle. (LAUGHTER) 

That's not what I call subtle. 

I don't think the president of the United States has the word subtle in his vocabulary. 

Or his behavior. But he clearly said to three of the Financial Times reporters, look, I hope to get the Chinese to cooperate on this, but we're prepared to go it alone. 

Well, you know, Charlie, I think this is really the big one for Mar-a-Lago, and within both capitals, it's also the hardest one. It's tough. It's inherently complicated. What do we know? Kim Jong-un, North Korean nuclear weapons program, missiles, miniaturized warheads, enough bombs being produced in terms of fissile materials from his reactors, and so, we're getting closer and closer to that technical threshold where, once they cross it, they have the capability to either threaten directly South Korea, Japan, or even Guam, or even Alaska, or even further to the West Coast of the United States. Quite apart from other allies in East Asia as well. 

What's interested me, in part, is how they play this out. But part of it is, I mean, the Chinese should have probably seen this moment coming, you know, because, as the president said to me in an interview, President Obama, every time they fail they learn something, and they've been getting closer to where they want to be. The Chinese had to know that that was coming, yet there's been small and nuanced -- small nuances, but not a lot of effort to figure it out. They've well-said reasons as to why they have certain interests there, they don't want to see, you know, South Korea take over and become that close to their border, they don't want to see refugees pouring in across the border, and a lot of other considerations they have. But North Korea having a nuclear weapon has been, you know, on a fast track. 

Running down the railroad track toward us. Yes, I agree. What I think we also know from international relations is that sometimes things happen out there which just look too awful, that you'd rather just look the other way for a while and hope that something else happened. And I think one of the dynamics in Beijing, given the extraordinary history between China and North Korea going back to the Korean War, is that this has a whole layer of political complexity, when you look at it through the lens of that politburo standing committee. Like these guys used to be our allies. We went and defended them against the American invaders, that's the Chinese domestic political narrative of the Korean War. So it's tough and it's hard and it's complex. But the objective truth doesn't change, the one you just spoken about and I did, too, in terms of missiles, range, accuracy and enough warheads to actually constitute a real threat. So the key question now from Mar-a-Lago, again, is what then is to be done. I think strategically there are kind of three courses of action. They're almost as a matter of logic. One is you keep doing what you're doing in terms of current diplomacy on North Korea, which largely centers on a series of escalating U.N. security council sanctions, financial sanctions, coal sanctions, et cetera, in the hope of inducing a change in North Korean behavior, to which the answer is, including in Washington, is fail, fail, fail. It's achieved nothing. You know, it's something we need to just call a spade a spade. That's kind of what's happened here. 

Yes. But it also raises the question, I mean, can you trust any negotiations with the leadership in North Korea? 

Well, you know what the guy we just talked about Ronald Reagan used to say, trust and verify. And I think -- he was a great communicator, President Reagan. And so the simple three words actually sum up the essence of how you do this, and they have been applied also to the question of the Iranian nuclear deal, as you know. So, if current diplomacy is failing and you don't want to go down the unilateral military option, which is, the United States concluding one day, well, we're simply just going to have to act to take this out militarily. Then if China doesn't want to see that happen, then what's the third way through? Is there a new diplomacy which actually works? To which my answer is maybe, but for their system, it's really tough getting to that point. The ingredients of it, as you've probably seen it written before, is what's often described as the grand bargain, a whole bunch of elements on the table, including, on the one hand, getting North Koreans to stop current testing. Two, trust and verify and establish that they've destroyed their existing arsenals, both missiles and warheads and fissile material. But, on the other side of the agenda, what's in it for them? And what's in it for them, a formal peace treaty with the United States. We haven't had one since '53. It's just a tricky armistice, which applies at the moment. Diplomatic recognition, the U.S. accepting the international legal legitimacy of North Korea. Then on top of that, an external set of security guarantees for the North Korean regime, given that their basis for their nuclear program is we think we're going to be attacked one day and our regime will be overthrown by the Americans or somebody, and, therefore, the nuclear option is the only one for us. So is there an agreement between China and the United States which can provide, under international treaty law, that sort of external security guarantee, martial plan for rebuilding the north. These are the ingredients which come into it. Now, what I know about high-level meetings of the type that these two presidents are about to have with each other in Mar-a-Lago is that each of what -- the neat little list I've just run through is a box of complexity. But if you could get to a point where, based on a good dynamic in the meeting, that President Trump and President Xi agreed as a matter of principle to look at the possibility of a new diplomatic approach, and then delegate the national security advisors to then drill down over several months, that would represent some progress. 

Do the Chinese have any interest in what might be called G2, the idea that these are the two great economies and the two strongest countries in the world? 

It's funny you say that because it's kind of like an exercise in missed timing because back in the days of the Obama administration, there was some early flirtation with the idea of a G2 between the United States and China. The Chinese didn't want to borrow it because it would offend their position within the bricks, with the G77 and all those other groupings including their relationship with the Russians, et cetera. And so it was pushed to one side. Then years later, the Chinese kind of got interested. Then you had President Xi talking about what's called a new style or new type of great power relations, it's a particular phrase in Chinese. And so by that stage, President Obama's administration, I think, having got a lot of reaction from Southeast Asia, a lot of reaction from others around the world, and they said no. So what's the future of this? I think it's limited, given the inconsistent interests of the two. But where it could get useful for both countries is just to have this list of here's the stuff that we can work on that's hard, but we could get agreement, which is in our mutual interests, such as a better deal on trade, such as avoiding the unilateral option on North Korea, while not pretending that this becomes a relationship on which you can base the entirety of the global order or global governance on. 

There is so much more to discuss. I'm looking forward to what happens down there. Thank you for coming, pleasure to have you here. 

The temperament will be important. 

The temperament? 

Yes, if I've got 30 seconds more. 

Sure. 

I think it's the mood of these meetings which really matters as well. The Chinese place enormous priority on questions of respect and face. Sometimes, you know, in the West, we think that face is something that only the Chinese pay attention to. And -- but, you know, it's equally a factor in western politics as well. None of us like to be publicly humiliated. So I think one of the things that's important for both presidents as they approach this meeting is being mutually respectful and frankly mutually inquisitive. I'm sure President Xi would enjoy finding out from President Trump, how did you win? 

Yes. 

And then maybe President Trump will be interested to know, how do you handle a party congress of the communist party? 

And what are you going to do coming up, and what about whether you're going to go for a third term yourself? 

Well, President Bush used to always say to me, we've all got our politics, Kevin. You tell me what yours are and I'll tell you what mine are. So I think there is a bit of wisdom in that today as well. 

Thank you again. 

Good to be on the program. 

Back in a moment. Stay with us. John Mayer is here, the seven-time Grammy Award Winner has sold more than 30 million records worldwide. He has shared the stage with guitar greats like B.B. King, Carlos Santana, and Eric Clapton. Clapton calls him a master guitar player. Mayer returns with his first album in four years, it is called, "The Search for Everything." I'm pleased to have John Mayer at this table for the first time, welcome. 

Thank you very much, Charlie. 

This is so good that you had to release it in stages. Is that basically what happened? 

I believe in the songs so much that I thought they deserve to be seen without distraction from either the barrier to entry of so many songs all at once, or other music coming in and sort of -- or there being so many songs -- songs that aren't that great, a couple of songs that are, and I felt like the boldest thing I could do was say I think I did it and take a look at these four at a time. And the response to it has not only been positive for the work, but positive for the format of releasing music that way. So I was not alone because I'm one-half consumer, one-half artist, and I remember seeing some really great records from great artists come up on, you know, my Spotify or Apple, or whatever it be, and I go, 12? 

Yes. 

Because this is a deep dive. Maybe I'll just go for the singles right now. And so I wanted to put music out the way that I myself would want to hear it as somebody on the other end. 

Is it hard to get acceptance for albums? I mean, I've had people -- musicians come up to me and say what's happened to albums is disgraceful. 

Yes. I think I've been known traditionally now as an artist, as an album artist. 

Right. 

So I think I've probably engendered a little more trust with my audience about making records than maybe other artists have. So I'm OK being a dinosaur in this time, being the guy who makes records. But even then I've sort of broken up the concept of a record. I want to ultimately have a record, but I think what this was was about making it small enough for people to -- it's just an easier point of entry into it, but ultimately ends up with a record that has an arc, and we think about sequencing, and we think about the power of serializing one song before the next and the next. That still matters, I feel like. It may not matter now, but I think it may matter again, and what you want to do is sort of future-proof it so that if and when people go back to albums, you never looked frightened. 

Yes. The Search For Everything. 

Yes. 

The title. 

Titles come to me and they stop the title searching game. (LAUGHTER) And they tend -- 

They
