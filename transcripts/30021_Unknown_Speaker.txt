JAMES KAPLAN sold his first short story 

Suburbs in New Novel 

to The New Yorker magazine at the age of 23. His fiction writing has been compared to such authors as John Updike and J.D. Salinger. His latest book, Two Guys from Verona, is set at the turn of the millennium and tell a story of isolation and emptiness in modern suburbia. The New York Times book review calls it ''a complex and moving meditation on the passage of time and the stubborn human urge to resist its merciless forward tug.'' I am pleased to have JAMES KAPLAN on this broadcast. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. Great to be here. 

Set this book up because obviously it's a play off of Shakespeare's Two Gentlemen from Verona. 

Yes, it's a story of two guys in New Jersey -- Joel and Will, both 43 years old. And Joel-- Will, I should say, is a guy who, on the face of it, has everything. He has a car, a couple of cars, a house, a mortgage, a wife, couple of kids. And all Will can think about is the future and making the big score. He works for his father, who owns a cardboard box company, and he's dreaming of the day when his father sells the company. And he's gonna make a million bucks. Joel, his friend for 30 years, lives at home with his mother and makes sandwiches in the local sub shop. On the face of it, Joel is the loser, Will is the winner. They go to their 25th high school reunion and their lives take a turn from there. 

How so? 

Well, the story of the book is really kind of a story of how their lives intertwine and then flip-flop at the end of the book. 

And it's a novel, and we can't tell the story because you want people not to be caught up-- and I don't intend to do that, but tell me what you were after. 

I was-- I was fascinated-- I wanted to write a story about my suburbs, as I experienced them, the Jersey suburbs as I knew them growing up. I also wanted to write about the millennium. I wanted to write about how people my age are spooked by the millennium. I think we are spooked by the idea of this first digit, this first digit in the thousands switching from ''1'' over to ''2.'' I think we're spooked by the idea that this is the strange territory that we are going to die in -- this new millennium. And so I wanted to write about that. I also-- I was very intrigued by Martin Amis' book, The Information, in which two friends envied each other. I wanted to write about two friends who pitied each other, which Joel and Will do. 

Tell me about the suburbia. What do you want to say about-- 

Well, yes, it is true that there is huge amount and disconnection in the suburb of which I write -- this fictional Verona. But also-- Joel, the guy who makes the sandwiches in the sub shop is a kind of-- is a kind of wacky seer. He is outside of society. He is-- He's a guy who drives around in a '69 Impala, drinking bourbon out of the bag, and on the face of it somebody who doesn't fit in at all. And yet he sees a kind of compelling poetics to the suburbs. He sees things in colors-- about colors, about leaves and about lawns that other people in the suburbs don't quite notice. 

And you, yourself-- I mean, a novelist is always writing about himself -- most of the time-- see yourself in some combination of the two of these guys? 

I think so. I think that-- well, I think I wrote my obligatory autobiographical first novel a few years ago. 

Right. 

And I like to think of this as being utterly fiction. On the other hand, every character in this book -- man, woman and child -- is me. I think Joel and Will are both me in the sense that Will is kind of-- Will-the-householder-and-m ortgage-payer and constantly-sexually-fantas izing suburban dad is kind of every worst instinct I've ever had tuned all the way up. Joel is-- Joel is the guy who would say and do what I would never dream of doing in any given situation simply because he has nothing to lose. 

Male friendship-- when you-- does the novelist go look for some sense of the dynamics of male friendship? Or do you just write from you own experience and heart when you're trying to characterize what it's like and what it is -- the dynamics of this relationship? 

I started out picturing this book-- I was thinking about-- Joel and Will every Saturday afternoon drive around, drinking the whisky out of the-- out of the bag. And I just started out imagining this book by thinking about the two of them in this car and thinking about Will feeling so sorry for Joel because Joel is this loser who lives at home with his mother and doesn't do anything with his life and Joel feeling so sorry for Will because he has no poetry to his soul, because all he can think about is the future. I've had friendships where there have been touches of that, where I've had the strange sense that I'm feeling sorry for my friend and my friend is feeling sorry for me. I think male friendship has not been written about a tremendous amount. I think female friendship much more so. Of course, it's a slight play-- 

More movies have been made about male friendship and male bonding than-- 

You think so? Than about female? 

No. Yeah, movies have been certainly. 

Yeah, yeah. 

But more movies have been made about it about than books have been written-- 

That's true. 

A lot of prominent-- from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to things that are more-- of a different tenor. 

Yeah, yeah. 

There are a lot of male bonding movies about male friendship. Right? 

Yes. That's true. 

And less so, books that come to mind. The notion of the compare-- I would think it would, you know, paralyzing, after the fact even, to have people comparing you and drawing comparisons to Updike, Salinger. I mean, that's heady stuff, isn't it? 

It's very heady stuff. It's awesome to be compared to great writers. On the other hand, I've been writing a long time and, after many years of imitation and of often-perilous imitation, I like to think that I've found my own voice. I'm extremely flattered by the comparisons, and I'll take 'em. 

How do you write? I mean, tell me the process for you. 

Well, I-- what I like to say-- I've talked to a lot of young people recently about writing and what I like to tell them is that it's necessary to go through the bad days -- of which there are many more than there are the good days. And the amazing thing-- the amazing alchemy that happens is that after a while, after a few weeks or months, you notice that the product of your bad days is just as good as the product of those days on which you felt immensely inspired. 

Now, what's a bad day? 

A bad day is when the words won't come, when you feel like a slug, when you're staring at the screen-- 

And it doesn't seem to work. It has no rhythm and there's no-- there's no anything. 

Having said that, though, I should say that this novel came scarily fast and easily for me and I-- 

And it began with what? 

It began with-- again, the germ of this idea of these two men feeling sorry for each other. 

So, the idea was-- Nothing stimulated the idea, you just-- 

Well, having lived in the Jersey suburbs for 10 years and having thought deeply about what they looked like, what they felt like, what was wonderful about them, what was awful about them, I think that all boiled up in me over a long, long time. 

Do you intend to switch back and forth between fiction and non-fiction? 

It's a thought. I'm thinking-- I've been thinking seriously about doing a non-fiction book again next time. My last book was non-fiction -- A Portrait of Kennedy International Airport. 

Right. 

And-- yeah, I have been thinking about doing a memoir next, not of myself, but of my grandparents. 

Lots of that's taking place. 

Yeah. 

When you-- when you look at a book like this, how do you-- for you go from chapter to chapter to chapter? If you're writing a thriller, you know how to do that. 

Yes. 

What's the essential thing to be doing in a book that is about friendship and about a portrait of suburbia? 

Well, the essential thing in telling a story is always to leave it hanging at the end of any given chapter. I outlined and planned this book extremely carefully, which I had never done before with any book, and it proved to be a wonderful preparation for writing the book. I, of course-- 

So, you knew which each-- what was to be contained in each chapter? 

I did. And I knew what the ending was going to be-- This is not to say that I didn't change it as I went along. 

Or the characters didn't take on their flight. 

And they did. They did. That amazing thing that you always hear about and that had never happened to me before happened with this, which was the characters stood up, started walking around, and dictating to me. 

You mentioned Martin Amis and The Information. 

Yes. 

Why was that instructive for you? 

Well, I thought the book was terrific, and around the time it came out Amis was doing a publicity tour in the States. And I wrote a profile of him for New York magazine. 

Right. 

And we played tennis together. 

Because he's a tennis fanatic. 

Because he's a tennis fanatic and so am I. And it was a very interesting game. After the game, he said something fascinating to me. We were talking about the rise of the English novel and the relative-- the relative decline of the American novel in comparison. And I asked him why he thought that was. He said he felt it was the decline of the Jewish novel. Well, at this point, I had just begun writing Two Guys from Verona, which is a novel about Jews in northern New Jersey, and I bit my tongue. But I really felt like saying, ''Damn, me.'' 

''Here it is.'' 

''Here I am. Here it is. It's on the way.'' Yeah. 

The millennium -- do you really think our generation-- or what age fears the millennium? 

Yeah, I do. We are the generation, the first generation in all of recorded time, I think, who felt that-- who have felt-- who feel that youthfulness is our birthright. And there is something personally insulting about decline, about aging, to us. I also think that people-- one of the things that happens in this book is there is-- there's a run on the stock market. I think that people are tremendously both giddy and nervous about their portfolios as Will is in the book. 

Yeah. 

I think there's a lot-- and, you know, there's, of course, the whole computer crisis about the year 2000. I think that-- I think that people our age are freaked out by the-- by the change over 2000, more than they can say. And it has to do with mortality and with all these superstitious feelings about what might happen to our comfort and to our beauty. 

Two Guys from Verona, a novel of suburbia, JAMES KAPLAN. Thank you for joining us.
