We look at the efforts of some people to combat and save efforts the Rainforest. (video playback 00:33:10 to) Joining me now is Mutang (Tuo) and Mutang Urud. Mutang Tuo is a member of the Penan tribe from Borneo and Mutang Urud is a member of the (Kalaba) tribe. We'll talk a lot more about this. Also here is Tom Henley. He is Director of the Endangered People's Project, and Monica Whelan from Rainforest Action Network. What's unusual, we saw a photograph in the paper of the two of them walking down the street. What brings them to New York? What do you hope to accomplish here? It's a long way from Malaysia. 

That's true is it. The situation in Sarawak has grown so desperate over the past 5 years. 

You're talking about being a state. 

It's a state in the northern part of the island of Borneo, which is the 3rd largest island in the world, just south of the Philippines. It's a state of Malaysia. There's actually 2 states of Malaysia. There's Sarawak and Sabah. For the past 5 years, the native people of Sarawak, seeing how quickly their forest homeland was being destroyed by logging, and it's the most rapid rate that's ever been known in human history, have taken a peaceful stance in defense of that homeland by erecting barricades across the logging roads and standing there. Over the last 5 years, there's been many arrests, many imprisonments. The people, even as we sit here today and talk, are at those barricades again. Unfortunately, the international media are not allowed access to cover this. The Penan people and the other tribal people there felt it was very important that they be able to bring their voice, their message, directly to the world. That's one of the reasons why we're in New York. 

To talk to people at the UN and talk to government officials here in this country? 

To bring the concern of this very desperate situation to the world's attention because they are at their last stand now. 

I should mention that Mutang Tuo does not speak much English. Mutang Urud learned English from a Peace Corps volunteer? 

Yes, from America. 

Who was there from the United States? 

It was Jack Colbert. 

Yes. 

He was teaching us. 

What does the rainforest mean to you? What does it mean to Mutang Tuo? 

We are 26 tribal group in Sarawak. We depend mostly on the rainforest for our sources of food; wild boar, deer, snakes, and bird and also the fish from the water. Also for the Penan, who are nomadic, they depend entirely on the forest for their sources of food and all their, they don't plant rice. 

Most all of their food comes from the wild animals that they hunt? 

Yes. 

Yeah. This is what you hunt with? 

Yes. That's a blow pipe. It's from the big tree in the rainforest. 

The impact so far has been what? Japanese interests are purchasing from Malaysia the trees and sending the lumber to Japan? 

Yeah. 

How much has been taken and what's it doing to the rainforest? 

Actually now, about 70 to 80% of the logging logs from Sarawak goes to Japan. For the last few years, the rate of logging has become more intense in our area. It has caused a lot of destruction to the forest, to the homeland, and also to the rivers that we -- 

The Malaysian government probably says it brings enormous revenue to our country that we can use to educate children and provide for the public welfare. 

Yes, but the problem here is that, even though there are millions and billions of dollars involved -- It is said that there is $10 million dollars a day revenue from the company timber logging. This does not come into the economy of the country, much less to our people. It goes into the pockets of politicians and also limber tycoons. 

It's not being directly spent for the welfare of the people of Malaysia? It is more used for the pockets of the private benefit of the politicians? 

Yes. The highest ranking Minister in Sarawak is said to be wealth for a billion dollars outside here. 

How will it change your life, Mutang Tuo, if the rainforest continues to be, in Borneo, destroyed? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language). 

It will cause hunger for our people and a lot of suffering and sickness now. The end result will be we will die. 

Will die. Are some members of the tribe already being displaced by the destruction of the rainforest? 

Yes. Now there are about 9,300 Penan tribe. Only about 300 people are now still nomadic hunting- 

Three hundred out of 9,000? 

Yes. 

Tom Henley, you co-authored a book by -- This is the cover of the book. It's called Penan. We've got some pictures. I just want to show you because we hear a lot of conversations about rainforests. We don't know what's going on because it takes place so long away from here. It does have a direct impact on what we and how we, it influences all of us. Here is the first still I want you to see, the first photographs, which is from this book. You'll see the virgin rainforest. Tell me what I'm seeing, Tom. 

You're looking from a section of (Mua) National Park, one of the very tiny areas within Sarawak that's been protected. Unfortunately, the Penan whose homeland this has been for maybe up to 50,000 years, have been forcibly removed from this area. The lowland area you see in the distance is actually the private timber holdings of the Chief Minister, I mean of the Minister of the Environment for Sarawak, James (Huang). He owns that land. He is widening that at an astronomical rate. 

Why is he doing it other than just simply private gain? Does he have no sense of what it does to -- 

The Sarawak state government assures the world that their forestry policies are very sound, that there's always going to be forest here. The fact is, even the international timber trade organization, which has done a study on Sarawak said, that at the current rate of cut, all the primary forest will be gone within 10 years. They've called for a drastic cutback in that. The whole world community's calling for that, but there's tremendous private interests as Mutang Urud alluded to. The Chief Minister of Sarawak has gone from rags to riches. He, today, is worth $4 billion American, just from timber concessions. 

The Penan and the other tribes are doing what? They're engaging in blockades? 

The Penan people in particular don't even have a word in their language for warfare. The only way they know how to confront a situation like this is through peaceful means. They've been erecting peaceful barricades across the logging roads. 

You have never been at war with another tribe? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

We never have been at war with any tribe. 

Never. Yeah. We've got some pictures here. Take a look at this. This is also a shot of a blockade, which is what the tribes are doing. This is a locally initiated effort by the tribes, supported I guess by whom? 

Monica. Tom. 

Who supports the (tribe)? 

The Penan people, and the people of Sarawak themselves, initiated this protest to the logging there. Now the world community has responded. Most environmental groups in the world are strongly supporting them in this. This is actually initiated by the tribal people themselves, not outside agitators. 

Okay the next slide will show you some of the natives I think at the blockade. This is the bulldozer here. This is the bulldozers that are used to I guess what? 

I guess for your viewing audience to try and comprehend what's happening to these people, this would be like a bulldozer coming into Manhattan and bulldozing your schools and your hospitals, your libraries, your apartments, your supermarkets, and even the grave sites of your ancestors. It's a total destruction of everything these people know. 

What's happening to the tribe, to the Penan? 

As they mentioned, 9,000 people have been removed into these government relocation camps, much as the Indian reserve reservation system took place here in North America. In these camps, there's a tremendous amount of disease and suffering, of hunger, malnutrition. The World Wildlife Fund studies have shown a drastic reduction in the amount of protein intake. Their life is not improving as the government is promising. It's getting much worse. 

Because of Sting and other people, other entertainers, other performers, people with high visibility, we know about the plight of the rainforest. Is there something special about this effort that makes it any different? I mean is this a place where, because of the effort of the tribes, they're saying, "We can make a stand." 

I think what makes this so very, very important to the world, and so pressing, is that fact that the forest that they are trying to protect is the oldest, richest living ecosystem on the planet. It's 180 million year old rainforest, much older than the Amazon or Africa. The people that are making this stand to protect it are probably the most peaceful people left on earth. They don't have a word in their language for war. They don't have a word or a concept for greed. Most of the 5.3 billion of us outside of this culture in this world, have somehow bought into this notion that this is a very basic part of human nature. We have this living testimony to the human spirit that we don't have to follow that course. I think the Penan represent a very bright thread in the human rainbow. We've got to do everything we can to protect this culture. 

What makes you think you can win against the kind of economic interests you're fighting? 

I think the pressure that's mounting internationally right now and the world public opinion is going to have to persuade the Malaysian government to take a different course here. I would really encourage them to do so because they don't have to come out of this looking bad. The world community is quite willing to work with the Malaysian government in helping to resolve this and to commend them and give them international awards for stepping in and protecting the human rights of the people and this forest, which I think is the greatest national treasure that the country of Malaysia has. 

Yeah. What do you love best about Borneo? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

What I like most is that the abundance of life in the forest. This is what we are trying to preserve. 

What's life in a forest like for you though? 

(foreign language) 

What do you do every day? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

Every day, we would go hunting and get food from animals. Also we will go and, if there are fruits, climb this fruit, and also taking (rattans) and to do this handicraft work. 

This? You do this? 

Yes, these are done by the women and the children. 

What about the markings on your arms? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

This is not. I just wanted it to be done. 

He said what? 

It's not traditional. 

Oh, it's not traditional. This is just you? 

Yes. 

Personal expression. 

Yeah. Are you ready to go home? 

(foreign language) 

Yes. (foreign language). 

Yes. I'm really longing to see my adopted daughter and also my family. 

How old are you? 

Twenty-six. 

Twenty-six? 

Yeah. 

Do you understand English? You hear what my question but what? 

(foreign language). 

No, in English. In English. Come on. 

In English. English. 

What? A little bit? 

Yeah. 

If I say, how old? You know 26? How old? Twenty? 

Yeah, 26. 

Twenty-six. Married? 

No. I'm single. 

When might you get married? 

I don't know when. 

(inaudible) next year. 

When? You have adopted children? You said adopted children? 

One child. 

One child? How old? Two? Three? 

Now is one year and three months. 

One year and three months? 

Yeah. 

Boy or girl? 

Girl. 

Will you teach her to hunt or does she hunt? 

No. 

Later when you teach her? 

Yeah. 

To use the blow gun? 

No. 

What do you shoot in this? Do you shoot from this end, yes? 

No. 

No. 

From this end? 

This end. 

That's right, the bigger end. What do you put inside? A little. 

A dart. 

A little what? 

Poison darts. 

Poison darts. Yeah. Do you make them? 

Yeah. 

Out of what? What do you make them from? Plants? 

From the sago palm. 

Sago palm leaves. The fronds. What do you call that? 

Stem. 

Yes. 

What's the biggest animal you can kill with this? 

A wild boar, a deer. 

A wild boar? 

Oh, yeah. 

Yeah. Monkey. 

The poisons on these darts are so toxic, they could kill an elephant with one. 

Is that right? 

There's no elephants in the area. There are in Sabah. They're incredibly toxic. 

One of these would kill an elephant? 

It could. 

Or a wild boar (crosstalk). 

We don't want to kill them. 

Wild boar. 

Wild board. 

With one- 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

Oh, rhinoceros. 

A rhinoceros? Yes? You? 

Before. 

Before. 

What about birds? 

Also. 

Birds also. 

Yeah. 

What's your favorite food? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

I like most of the food in the forest, especially meat. 

Meat? Like wild boar? 

Yeah. 

What's a delicacy? You know? What special? 

(foreign language) 

Fish? 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

Most deer. 

Most deer. 

Deer? 

Most deer. They grow slowly. 

Little deer. Yeah. I know you're asked about this all the time, but everybody's curious. It's the question that you get tired of being asked. Your impressions of the United States and America? 

(foreign language) 

The air? 

(foreign language) 

The atmosphere here and especially the air, I don't like it. 

Dirty. 

Yeah. 

Yeah? It's clean in Borneo? 

Yes. Clean. 

When will you be back home. 

(foreign language) 

(foreign language) 

On the 9th of October. 

Yeah. Can you win this battle? 

I'm sure this battle's going to be won. 

Why are you so sure? I mean (crosstalk) overwhelming odds. Look what's happening. 

Because I see the momentum is continuing to grow all the time. No one's losing any ground. The people's determination has not wavered and the international community is responding more strongly, at many different levels. I'm absolutely convinced this will be saved. The challenge here is- 

Because the UN will take an action? Because some international group of nations will get together to say what? 

I think the world community is going to respond to this very strongly. We're starting to see some momentum at the United Nations level now. I think it's not going to happen without everyone expressing their desire that it happen. 

You make it happen by pressure on the buyer or pressure on the seller, the buyer being- 

There's a lot of different- 

-- other European and American companies? 

There's a lot of different strategies that can be pursued here. I know the Rainforest Action Network is actually boycotting Mitsubishi as one of the major companies that are- 

Sanctions kind of? 

There's that type of thing. There's also some quiet diplomacy that's taking place that may actually resolve this. 

Quiet diplomacy meaning? 

Yeah at very high levels between the governments and the United Nations' representatives. 

Are the Japanese, and I don't want to engage in Japanese bashing, but are they the least bit receptive to the argument? 

There are some groups in Japan that are concerned with this. The fact is that the vast majority of the wood, 80% of it goes to Japan. It's just really wasted as plywood construction forms. 

I've been waiting to ask you this question I know because of what you are doing with the Rainforest Action Network. You're here to tell us what you do and what can be done, if in fact, you'd like to enlist in the efforts to protect the rainforest in Borneo. Monica: I think the most important thing is that everybody think about the future. We talk about these people going home. Is there going to be a place for them to go? I mean everybody needs to think about it, in your own life, in your profession, in what you do, in how you consume things, and where you invest your retirement fund. You have to follow it all the way through. The responsibility for the world cannot be left on the shoulders of a few environmental groups. It's something that everyone has to do- If someone said, Monica, "What's in it for me? Why should I care about this? It doesn't concern me. I've got a lot of other issues that are more important to me to be concerned about than long, far away Malaysia and rainforest there." Monica: It's the future of evolution. It's the future of the life of the planet. If the rainforests go, what happens to the life of the planet? Monica: We would lose tremendous species. More than 50% of all of the life on the planet is in the rainforest. We would lose probably more than a fifth of the fresh water on the planet. I mean the rainforest is a very, very special, important place. It's not just another forest. Yeah. 

If I might add to that, I think that even sometimes we tend to get very self-centered. What's in it for me as a New Yorker? What's in it for people in New York is the fact that this is botanically the richest spot on earth. Almost all of our drugs that new research cures for cancer- 

Are within the rainforest? 

-- possibly AIDS and everything, it's all coming from the rainforest. The Penan people probably have the greatest knowledge of plants of any people on earth. They've lived in a rainforest longer than any people we're aware of on the planet. They're living in botanically the richest zone on earth. The few eco-botanical studies that have been done there have shown that their knowledge base is astonishing. Dr. Wade Davis, the ethno-botanist who was in there said that every time we lost a Penan person and their knowledge base, it's like having the Library of Congress in Washington, DC burn to the ground. We are not going to duplicate that knowledge. A scientist is never going to duplicate it. We haven't even classified the species yet that are in these forests. These people have been living there for maybe 50,000 years and they know multiple uses for each of these species. 

What's the significance though, and some will say, of bringing Mutang Tuo here? Why is that important? I mean- 

Yeah actually the last thing I think should have to happen in this world is for people to have to leave their homelands like that and go out and suffer and be exposed to flues and cold and air that they're not used to breathing and food they're not used to eating. What's happening in this case is the Penan people felt so desperate. They knew the international press couldn't get in to see what was happening there. In many cases, if it's not on the 6:00 news, it's not happening. They knew that they had to come out and face possible political reprisals and illness and even death to get their message out. That's what they've done. I think these people are very courageous in what they're doing. They're doing it out of absolute desperation. 

Thank you Monica Whelan. Thank you very much. Thank you, Tom Henley. Mutang Urud 

Thank you. 

Thank you very much to my new friend. 

Thank you very much. 

I come to Borneo can I go hunting with you? 

Yes. 

Oh yes. Do come. Come. 

Thank you all. Fascinating young men. I want to thank Dan Rather again and also mention that the dance break that we had between the Rather segment and this segment was the American Indian Dance Theater, Eagle Dance. Thank you for joining us this week. Tommy Tune will be here on Monday. It's been a good first week for us. I hope you enjoyed it and will join us again on Monday, every
