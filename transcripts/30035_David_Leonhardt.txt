Dennis Berman:Good evening. I'm Dennis Berman filling in for Charlie Rose. Donald Trump swept to the White House on a promise to improve the lives of those left behind by the financial crisis and other changes overtaking the economy. He has also pledged to revoke and replace Barack Obama's signature achievement as president, the Affordable Care Act. But the hurdles to achieving this ambition appear increasingly challenging for President Trump. Joining me from Washington is David Leonhardt, a columnist for the "New York Times," and he writes about the problems facing the president's effort to dismantle Obamacare in today's "Times." Also joining me is William Cohan, here in New York, he's a special correspondent for "Vanity Fair," and author of a provocative newly-titled book, "Why Wall Street Matters." I note that we are taping this program before President Trump's address to Congress later this evening. David, let's get started with you. You mentioned in your column basically that the Republicans are backed into a corner on Obamacare. What do you mean? 

David Leonhardt:Well President Obama's health law was actually a very politically moderate health law. It was market-based. It took ideas that have come from both the right and the left. And it essentially said we're going to expand coverage for people, but we're going do it in this market-based way. It was to the right of not only Bill Clinton's plan. It was to the right of Richard Nixon's plan. It was way to the right of Harry Truman's plan. And so, if you want to expand health insurance coverage, it's really hard to do it in a way that's a lot more conservative than Obamacare. And Republicans did a very effective job politically of blasting Obamacare. But now that they're actually running government, they've realized that getting rid of Obamacare and also keeping their other promises, which is not throwing people off of healthcare and not causing prices to go up, is actually enormously difficult. And they still may do it and decide they're willing to accept throwing people off of healthcare, but they're struggling right now. 

Dennis Berman:David, you mentioned the term magical promises of Trump. What is specifically magical by your reckoning? 

David Leonhardt:I mean, he's had several lines where he's basically said this version of we're going to cover everyone, the coverage is going to be better and it's going to be cheaper. And, you know, people -- economists like to say there is no such thing as a free lunch, right? That you can't both cover everybody and have everything be cheaper. Or if you did, it would require really hard choices about getting rid of waste in the healthcare system that led to the whole debate over death panels. And so, neither Trump nor the congressional Republicans have ever said, look, what we're going to do is we are going to cut taxes, but that also means we're going to have to cut benefits, or we're going to raise taxes and raise benefits. They've sort of just pretended that they could have it all. And when they weren't governing, they were able to do that. But now that they're actually in charge, it's proven particularly difficult. And the Republican governors are really interesting to watch here because they actually have to run states. And what we saw this weekend, when they came together was they said, wait a second here, we don't want you throwing a lot of our citizens off health insurance, and those are the kind of tensions that Republicans are now trying to figure out how to solve. 

Dennis Berman:All right, let's bring in Bill Cohan. Thanks for joining us. Bill, there seems to be a somewhat of a predicament for many of the ideas promised by the Trump administration prior to the inauguration and after. Lots of great promises, the market believes it. What can we expect in terms of the market realities hitting the policy realities from your vantage point? 

Unknown Speaker:So, of course, you know, we all think back to election eve when it looked like Trump was going to win, and did win, the market futures fell about a thousand points. And I think everybody thought it would just go downhill from there. As many people have said, I think it's remarkable that the fact the opposite has happened. The pundits were kind of wrong. The market is now approaching 21,000. I can only imagine what the reaction among Americans would be if the market had in fact fallen to 14,000 instead of rising to 21,000. I think Donald Trump has gotten a lot of political mileage and economic mileage out of the fact that the markets have risen so dramatically, so quickly, and we are still talking about this Trump bump. The question is in my mind is when does it stop? I mean, obviously, we know it's not going to go on forever, and never does. But the question is when will people sort of come to terms with the fact that the trees don't grow to heaven, and I think it's going to start when, as David was talking about, if Obamacare does not get repealed and the costs related to that, the costs of this proposed new budget that we're beginning to hear more and more about, what if he can't repeal some of the regulations that he's talked about repealing? What if he can't get the tax cuts that he's talked about, that he's promised? What if he can't repatriate these trillions of dollars from overseas? I mean, when his reality of governing hits up against the promises that he made, then I think people are going to say, hold it, whoa, we may need to re-think this stock market reaction here. 

Dennis Berman:David, you know both business and politics, what are the limits of reality and actual progress economically based on the Trump agenda as you see it? 

David Leonhardt:I mean, I think we shoved some real skepticism that the market is reacting to what's going on with Trump either way. You know, we had a stock market boom for the vast majority of Obama's presidency. We had stocks rising when everyone, including people in the market thought Hillary Clinton was going to be elected. Then there was that little gyration when Trump was elected, and now the market has gone back to booming even more so. And so, I think the effect that any individual president has on the market is relatively limited. And I think it's possible that the market boom could end even if Trump's agenda succeeds. And I think it's possible that the market boom could continue even if his agenda falls apart. I mean, I think one of the lessons is we as citizens give presidents way too much credit for the economy and too much blame. It wasn't actually George H.W. Bush's fault we had a recession in the early '90s, et cetera. I think the question is, is the Trump administration doing the kinds of things that are likely to lift growth? I'm skeptical of that. 

Dennis Berman:Why are you skeptical, David? Give us three quick examples, if you could. 

David Leonhardt:I mean, the basic notion that the way to turbo charge growth is to cut taxes and to have less regulation. If you look over the last 50 years, there isn't evidence one way or the other. Yes, growth surged after Ronald Reagan did that, but growth was really weak after George W. Bush did it. And growth was even faster under Bill Clinton, who regulated and raised taxes, than under Ronald Reagan. And so, I looked at all that evidence and I say, you know what, I don't think modest changes or even significant changes in the tax rate are the primary drivers or even significant drivers of growth. These things are more unrelated than they are related. 

Dennis Berman:So, if nothing matters, David, then what does matter when it comes to the American economy? 

David Leonhardt:Well, things certainly matter. I think long-term, there's absolutely no question that education matters. I don't think anything matters as much as education, and the skills of a workforce long term. That's not a year-to-year thing. Year-to-year thing, I think we know much less about the economy. I think we know the fed is really important. And I think we know avoiding financial crisis are really important. I think the odds of a financial crisis anytime in the next few years are relatively low, but I do worry a little bit that we could be seeing some signs of excess. And we saw a decade ago that not caring about regulation is not a particularly great way to avoid financial crisis. 

Dennis Berman:Bill, you wrote a book, Why Wall Street Matters. Do you agree with David? It sounds like he's taking a pretty centrist view there. 

Unknown Speaker:I don't want to be put in a position of disagreeing with David, but I'm going to a little bit here. I do think tone matters. I do think some policies do matter. When you, just as a pure mathematical calculation, if you increase corporate profits by reducing taxes, for instance, then, as you know, the price-to-earnings ratio that the market is of course driven on, will, you know -- the stock market will go up because earnings have gone up. You don't even have to expand the multiple on that for that to happen. And I think some of the reason why the stock market has gone to 21,000 is the expectation that those tax rates will be cut, corporate tax rates, which are obviously the highest in the western world and probably need to be lowered, although I'm not sure why, but that seems to be something that people talk about or are excited about. And I think that's part of the reason why the stock market has gone up. You know, when you deregulate, I mean, look, the pendulum swings, right? You know, the Clinton administration at the end, you know, took off Glass-Steagall and, you know, it was a free-for-all basically. 

Dennis Berman:The law that governed how banks were regulated. 

Unknown Speaker:Whether they could be both in the investment banking business and the commercial banking business. And, you know, under Christopher Cox, the surfer congressman who was chairman of the SEC during the George Bush administration, you know, all sense of regulation was taking off. And basically, it was like Wall Street was driving on the wrong side of the road with a Ferrari and a whiskey bottle in their hand. And no surprise we got into a huge financial crisis in 2008. Now we're in a position where I think there's been too much regulation, too much sand thrown in the gears of the left ventricle of capitalism if you will, this beautiful machine. And now we're in a position where Donald Trump is saying, hey, we're going to take all of this off. I think there needs to be some sort of grand bargain with Wall Street, where there is a corresponding agreement from Wall Street that we're going to reform our compensation system, so that our incentives on Wall Street are just not to reward people for taking big risks with other people's money. If you take off all regulation and let people gamble with other people's money, then you're literally asking for a financial crisis. And that's where I disagree with David a little bit. I think if we don't marry a grand bargain of compensation reform and incentive reform on Wall Street with this deregulation, you are virtually guaranteed a financial crisis. 

Dennis Berman:So from a legislative standpoint, your best tweaks would be, from your perspective, what? 

David Leonhardt:I think it depends what the goal is. I think if the goal is long-term growth, then I think you want to make sure that you're not running up long-term deficits. So I'm concerned that the whole focus of the Trump administration is on the discretionary budget, and there is no focus at all on social security and Medicare, which is where all of our long-term fiscal challenges come. I'm concerned that we seem to be disinvesting in things like science, education, that we know fuel long-term growth. So I think there are lots of things that matter. My skepticism is whether we can draw a straight line from most of these policies to the economy next quarter or the stock market this month. 

Dennis Berman:All right. The deficit question is an important one, I think, to bring up. If we look at the numbers the U.S. GDP -- or the debt to GDP is around 110 percent, which is a rather incredible number. We've gotten used to it over the last ten years, Bill. But back prior to that in the aughts, we were at about 60 to 70 percent. So how does the budget deficit factor in politically and economically? 

Unknown Speaker:I think this is, you know, the sort of Damocles hanging over the Trump administration because all that he's talking about so far, again, the nonpartisan tax policy center has examined Trump's proposals and said that the national debt is going to go from 20 trillion, which you know he railed against constantly, is going to go from 20 trillion to 27 trillion, we're going to look more like Greece and Japan on a debt to GDP ratio before long. We're already starting to get there, 110 percent from 60 percent is mind boggling. But, you know, we've had some big wars and they're very expensive. And we do seem to be comfortable with the national debt, and interest rates have been so low. So that's the market basically saying we're comfortable with your high debt to GDP ratio, but at some point something has to give. You can't give all the toys away for free and not expect to have to pay for them. 

Dennis Berman:David, you're on the ground in Washington. Are the Republicans willing to go further on the deficit than they have previously to get some of Trump's agenda passed in perhaps the ways they weren't comfortable before? 

David Leonhardt:I think it's unlikely. I mean, I think what we've seen from congressional Republicans is their number one priority on fiscal matters is cutting tax rates, cutting top tax rates, cutting taxes for companies and for higher-income individuals. That's a higher priority for them than the deficit. My guess is that will continue. They're in a tricky spot right now because the way they've lined this up legislatively and procedurally, healthcare has to come before taxes. They actually, I think, have an easier path to a Republican deal on taxes than on healthcare, but they can't get to healthcare without either passing healthcare first or abandoning it. And you saw the president lament this yesterday the fact that healthcare comes first. And so, that's going to be one of the really interesting things to watch today, abandon healthcare or do they come to a deal on healthcare which lets them get to taxes. And I think Republicans whether it's a good idea or not, I'm a little skeptical. I think Republicans will be able to agree to a deal. They will substantially cut high-end taxes, and will also substantially increase the deficit. There's a lot of Republican agreement around that idea. 

Dennis Berman:Doesn't that go against a lot of Republican views for the last few decades? 

Unknown Speaker:The catechism of the Republican economic platform has been deficit reduction, reducing the debt, and now we're talking about as if those things don't matter. It's mind boggling to me. 

Dennis Berman:What do the Republicans say, David, to someone in his or her district, exactly what Bill is saying. I've been preaching this for a long time. What's the argument? 

David Leonhardt:I mean, Americans aren't that worried about the deficit right now. And I don't think they're crazy to be focused in the medium term on other issues. I mean, I would argue that wage stagnation, I would argue that the rise in non-employment that isn't even captured by the unemployment rate, I would actually argue all those things are more serious immediate issues than the deficit. I think the deficit is a really serious long-term issue. But I don't think at this point there's a huge political price to pay for raising the deficit. The question is how do voters react when they see that the deficit was going up, and the reason it was going up was to deliver tax cuts to people who are already doing very well. And I don't know what the answer to that is going to be, but, boy, I'm confident the Democrats are going to run on that in the midterms if that's what the Republicans do. 

Dennis Berman:Let's run out here with one question for each of you. There were a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump, and they had grievances about the way the economy was headed. For people who don't pay attention to all this stuff we're talking about, but who care about what's in their pocketbook, what's the single most important thing they should be paying attention to right now, Bill? 

Unknown Speaker:In my mind, it's how Donald Trump deregulates Wall Street. How he deregulates business generally, and how he sort of unleashes the power of our economic engine, you know, and allowing capital to flow to small businesses that need it, to hire more people, to build new plants and equipment, to pay people higher wages, that is the single best way, I think, that the people who were so concerned about the way they've been treated, and who voted for Donald Trump, they're going to get the greatest benefit when that economic engine is starting to run properly again. 

Dennis Berman:David, I'll put the question to you. For people who don't care who David Leonhardt is or what he says, what's the thing they need to be most focused on? 

David Leonhardt:And to be clear, I think a lot of these grievances are legitimate. I think people are right to be angry about how the economy has done. Look, I think in the short term, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, I think they should care about health insurance because it's a huge driver of bankruptcy. And if we go back to the system where if you don't get it through your job, you don't have health insurance, we're talking about huge numbers of people who could be subject to bankruptcy. In the longer term, I would encourage them, don't just look at Washington. Look at your local school district. We were saying -- I was saying before that nothing affects long term growth and a community's living standards like education. So there is so much focus on Washington. For people who don't care about the week-to-week stuff in Washington, focus on how well your school district is doing because that will have a huge effect on the quality of your children's lives long term. 

Dennis Berman:All right, David Leonhardt, from "New York Times" in Washington, thanks so much for joining us. Bill Cohan, always a pleasure to chat with you. 

Unknown Speaker:Thank you. 

Dennis Berman:Tomorrow is March 1st. The first day of the month of the NCAA tournament. Villanova University is seeking to repeat as national champions. The Wildcats won in dramatic fashion last year after a buzzer beater to defeat North Carolina. It's already considered one of the signature moments in college basketball history. Joining me now is Jay Wright, he's the head coach of the Villanova Wildcats, and he captures last year's journey to the title and much more in a new book called "Attitude." Welcome to you, Jay. 

Jay Wright:Thanks so much. Good to be here. 

Dennis Berman:Set the feel for us. We're just a few weeks away from the start of the tournament. Is it a wide-open race and how does Villanova fit into that? 

Jay Wright:It is a wide-open race. And I think each year it's becoming more and more that way. Last year when we won it, it was wide open, I think it's more wide open this year. You've got Kansas as one of the top teams. Gonzaga is one of the top teams. We're one of the top teams right now, but any one of us can be beaten, and it's been proven. But any one of us could win it. I think it's up to 16 teams that could win it this year. 

Dennis Berman:Is there a reason structurally in college basketball why it's more open perhaps than in the past? 

Jay Wright:I think the one and done players make the top teams that get them, the Kentuckys, the Dukes, it makes them talented, but a little vulnerable, in that, if those guys stay for three years, they might be untouchable. But they're really talented, well coached, but an older team can get them sometimes, and it creates a balance, right? Back in the day when John Wooden was there at UCLA, they were getting all those guys and they're staying all four years, and it would get to the point where they were untouchable. But now, there is a good balance between young teams and experienced teams. 

Dennis Berman:And that seemed to be the formula you had last year. 

Jay Wright:Yes. 

Dennis Berman:You don't have a lot of great one-and-done players, you've got a solid, great team. So how do you develop that team? You know, there is an old basketball saying that nothing fails like success. How do you keep your edge going into that second year knowing -- you've got a book, you've got the championship, how do you keep it and how do you adapt? 

Jay Wright:It's the greatest challenge that faces us this year, not our opponents, you know, the expectations, the outside distractions, and we addressed it immediately in the locker room following the championship game. One of the first things we did, I talk about it in the book, was we hold hands to say a prayer after we get into the locker room. Now, in the championship game, that's about an hour after the game. You're on the court for so much celebration and fanfare and presentation, you finally get back into the locker room with your team. We hold hands to say a prayer. One of the first things we say was, look, let's make sure that this doesn't define you as an individual. Let's make sure that this ring isn't the most important thing you have in your life. Let's take what we've learned here and make sure we're able to do other things in life based on all the characteristics we used to do this. So right away, we were kind of starting on the fact that it's how we handle this that's going to be important going forward and that's what our guys have done a good job of this season. We address that everyone's going to talk to us about repeating, everyone's going to talk to us about winning a national championship, everyone's going to talk to us about the NCA tournament, much like we are now. We have to have the mental discipline to focus on today's work ethic, today's challenge, and one day it might be practice, the next day it might be a game against Georgetown. But no one else is going to be talking about that or focusing on that except us. That's our challenge this year. 

Dennis Berman:Have you faltered at all at that exercise? 

Jay Wright:I think at times we have all slipped. We had three losses this year. I think each one of those losses, there was a time in those games where our confidence got to us. We led in the second half of all three of our losses. I think there's a time where our confidence became a negative. It wasn't arrogance, it was more, OK, we've been here before, we've got a lead in the second half. This is what we do. We finish these. Instead of focusing on what do we have to do the next possession to make it the best possession we've ever played. And when you slip there a little bit, that's where you're vulnerable. So, as long as you address it afterwards, we're human, we slipped, all right, doesn't make us bad guys, but let's admit it and let's learn from it. 

Dennis Berman:Right. There is an interesting line in your book and you don't expand on it much, but you said, at one point, I thought I was better than I was. How did you go about the journey to find out how good you were and, in a way, who you were, when you think about that young coach or that young player who perhaps though he was better than he was? 

Jay Wright:I think we all do that when we attain some levels of success, we only look at what we did to get there, whether it be individually or even a team. A team not recognizing that all the other people around them that they are a part of that. And most importantly, the culture that's around them. I think there was a time when we went to our first Final Four where I thought, I've got this now, I've got it. I know what we have to do. And I didn't pay attention to as much the process of every day getting better and continuing to improve and evolve. And it caught up to us. We had a bad year. And I think as long as you go back to being honest and assessing your role in everything, right, at first, before you look at someone else that's around you, I think you can grow and get better and you can always recover. 

Dennis Berman:How does a winning attitude handle the negative emotions that we all have, disappointment, blame, anger? I could go on and on. But those are present for everyone and they're present in teams. What are the concrete things that you think about and you say to your team about those emotions when they surface? 

Jay Wright:It's the most important aspect of our program. That's why the book's called "Attitude." We wear "Attitude" wristbands. And when we break a huddle since our days at Hofstra, we say one, two, three, attitude. What we're reminding ourselves is, we're not responsible for the results of whatever happens. We're responsible for our effort and we're responsible for our attitude going forward. So as we get guys at 18 years old that come in, they're basketball players. They're not -- they know they're supposed to get their degree and they want to get an education, but when they first come, they're thinking basketball. So we first try to teach them on the court, the play that you make is not as important to us as how you react on the next play. That's what's most important to us. That's what we want you to use that attitude to separate you from other players. 

Dennis Berman:Coach Kay has a similar philosophy, next play, right? Same idea. 

Jay Wright:Exactly. 

Dennis Berman:So how do you apply that to your everyday life? So, go on. 

Jay Wright:So we chart in practice every drill we do. We keep score, but there's attitude points. The other team gets points. If you turn the ball over, the other team gets a point. But if you turn the ball over and you go back and don't hustle, or you make a face or there is a bad call, and you complain, that's two points for the other team. So we're monitoring how you react to negative situations, but also if you make a three -- 

Dennis Berman:You celebrate. 

Jay Wright:-- and you give a three point shot and celebrate, we want you to take any energy you have, don't give it to the crowd, take that energy and give it to your team. We want you to hit a three and say, let's get a stop on this next play. 

Dennis Berman:Do you think attitude points could ever apply in a corporate setting or a work setting? 

Jay Wright:I think, I do. I think valuing people's commitment to the core values of the organization, valuing their commitment to one another, and how they respond to success. We have a term "hungry and humble" that we wear wristbands, too, that when we have success, we've got to respond in a humble and hungry way. When we have failure, we've got to respond with a positive attitude. I think in an organization, you can find the people that in short term might not be having success numerically, but if you see their approach every day, you trust that their attitude is going to carry them to big-time success later. 

Dennis Berman:I've got one challenge though to what you're saying, and that is basketball is this beautiful game of flow and creativity and motion. How do you keep that vibe going and yet still have discipline? It feels like there is some value in being expressive. 

Jay Wright:Yes, and it's a creativity that comes with a free mind. Athletes are the most successful when their minds are clear. And if you have -- what that attitude gives you on the next play is a clear mind to make decisions that have not -- are not affected at all by what you did previously. A great example is, in our championship game against Carolina, we had a ten-point lead going down the stretch in the biggest game of the year. We blow the lead, so we make mistakes. Then we're up three with 13 seconds to go, we call time out. In the huddle we say, in a more articulate basketball way, we say the only thing we can do to screw up here is give up a three. We can foul. We can give up a two. We gave up a three. On an incredible shot. Our guys came back to the huddle, and they were looking each other in the eye just saying attitude, attitude. That's what we do to tell each other forget that last play, let's go into the next play with a clear mind. And we started the next play with 4.7 seconds. I wasn't sure Chris Jenkins would make that shot. But I was really proud of how clear their minds were. And I knew whatever decisions they made, it wasn't going to be affected by fear of failure because of the previous play. 

Dennis Berman:Interesting. Who has more sway in the locker room? Is it you or the smartphone? 

Jay Wright:That's good. I like to get it to the point where the most sway comes from our seniors. I like to get it to that point by the end of the season. And it takes a lot of work. The smartphone is involved in that. 

Dennis Berman:Do you say they can't use the phones during the season? 

Jay Wright:We take -- when we're on the road the night before the game, we take the phones from them. When they come into the locker room, we have a place where they put the phones and the managers keep them, because we want all their concentration once we -- we get into the locker room an hour and 45 before the game. We want all their concentration to be on each other. And even listening to music by themselves, we don't do that. 

Dennis Berman:Oh, that's interesting. 

Jay Wright:Because we want them to be vibing with each other and we want them to be connected to each other. Now, as soon as the game is over, they get it, and I know they're on it. But we have an hour and 45 there and as I said the night before the game in bed, we want their concentration to be on the game and each other. 

Dennis Berman:Are there players you won't recruit? And why not? 

Jay Wright:Yeah, there is a lot of players. There is a lot of players that don't want us, too. (LAUGHTER) But we really try to find someone that is going to thrive in our culture. We had a lot of success going to about 2009, we went to the Final Four. A couple of years after that, a lot of success. Then we got to the point it was kind of easy to get the top players and I didn't, as a head coach and the head of our organization, I didn't vet those players and I didn't explain to them what the culture was. I know the culture. They don't. It's not their fault. I have to make sure I'm bringing in people that I know will be successful in that culture and comfortable. If I'm not explaining it to a 16-year-old kid when he's making his decision, that's on me. And I didn't. We got some guys that it wasn't their fault, we just put them in a tough situation. So, we spend a lot of time getting close to guys and then getting to know them real well and realizing, you know what, they might not know it but this probably isn't a good fit. 

Dennis Berman:What do you do during the commercials during the tournament? Do you go nuts like the rest of us? They go on too long, right? 

Jay Wright:It's a significant difference than the regular season, obviously. 

Dennis Berman:Absolutely. 

Jay Wright:So, in the NCA tournament, we will spend a lot more time talking to our staff, first. Because for me, I don't want to be in front of those guys too long because I might have some things that I'm frustrated about that we're doing it. It's really not the time to share with them, but if you give me too much time, it's going to come out and it's not good. So I get with the coaches for a while and then I go in there, talk with the guys, and get them out of there. They are too long, I agree. 

Dennis Berman:But just as a fan, if you're not in the game or at a tournament, and you're watching, it goes on forever. 

Jay Wright:It does, I agree. But even for the coaches and the players. 

Dennis Berman:Right. 

Jay Wright:We don't want to sit there that long, we really don't, especially in the middle of the game. 

Dennis Berman:But it's built around the money necessary to support the NCAA. 

Jay Wright:Definitely. 

Dennis Berman:How do you feel about the level of commercialization that has penetrated the sport, in particular the tournament? 

Jay Wright:It's something that we discuss with our players, we discuss it a lot because there is a lot of things with the commercialization of the game and the publicity that you get. For an 18-year-old to 22-year-old kid you're trying to teach values of humility, right, and hard work, and not being about yourself, living for others, all of that goes completely against what you're teaching, you know, so we talk about it. We say, look, we get to play -- our home court in Philadelphia at the Wells Fargo Center, we get to play in front of 20,000 people, right? We travel on charter planes and stay in the best hotels. If not for all this, we are not doing that, so this is part of the business of it. But our main goal here is to be the best men we can be, to get our degree, be the best educated people we can be, and be the best players we can be. We've got to separate those two. 

Dennis Berman:But it's got to be hard, I mean, you mentioned in your book, you've had rap concerts to kick off the season. I think you said 50 Cent and Drake were there. 

Jay Wright:Yes. 

Dennis Berman:Do you ever sit and watch this concert and say, my Lord, what in the world does this have to do with basketball? 

Jay Wright:Definitely. 

Dennis Berman:So why don't you stop it? 

Jay Wright:Because it is a part of sport now. Sport has become entertainment. So, how do you want to do it? Do you want to fight it? You know, if you fight it, you're not going to get the players that allow you to compete in it. What we try to do is separate the competition. We have a saying, actors play to the crowd, players play for their teammates and coaches. Once we get on the court, that hour and 45 before the game we talked about, everything is about playing for your teammates and coaches. So we don't want any of our guys pumping their shirts or pointing to their back or pointing to the crowd to win the game. That's getting caught up in commercialization. After it's over, we have to meet with the media, we do our TV, we do all that, it's part of the game. 

Dennis Berman:Should the players be paid? 

Jay Wright:In college, I don't think so. 

Dennis Berman:Why not? 

Jay Wright:I think we have a unique system of amateur athletics that our guys get a great education -- and let me back up on that. As long as we are held responsible for educating them, they shouldn't be paid. If we're not going to educate them, then they should be paid. But if we are held responsible as coaches to educate these guys, we have 100 percent graduation rate of every player who's stayed for four years has gotten his degree on time. We take great pride in that. That's why I say, giving them a Villanova education that is probably worth $300,000 now over four years, and preparing them for the real world with all the travel, the food, the coaching, everything they get, I do think it's fair. 

Dennis Berman:But they also have a tremendous commitment to you, to the team in terms of hours spent in practice. They're not hanging out and having a great time like most kids in college are, they are cut to live a very disciplined life. 

Jay Wright:I disagree with that. I think they are having a great time. I think they do put in a lot of time. They get the best training for their professional careers. Every player that plays at Villanova is either going to play in the NBA or going to play professionally in Europe. We have a part of our program called "Life After Basketball," where we're committed to them after they play professionally. So we have a system set up that, when they start thinking about retiring, we start getting internships set up for them for the next part of their life. That's our commitment. Now, if we're not doing that, then they should be paid because then they're not getting the value of their efforts. 

Dennis Berman:It seems, though, for the average fan who's sitting there through the interminable commercials... (LAUGHTER) And counting the dollars, clicking over, saying, man, these players should be paid. And it feels that at least in the courts and the public opinion, that's where it is headed. 

Jay Wright:I agree. I agree that -- here's what I think there. I think there are few players that really add to that and go on to be professional, they add a lot of the value. I think those guys should be allowed to go to the NBA right out of high school. If you choose -- and I think the NBA is doing a good job with their D League where they could take some of those kids and develop them, and some of those kids wouldn't have to go to college. If you don't want to go, you shouldn't have to go just because you want to be a basketball player. They should be able to go right out of high school. If you go to college, you should be committed for three years, and much like the baseball model. And then you wouldn't have those guys that maybe get so much attention that are making the money -- I think you would see the schools will get the same amount of money without those guys and those high-level guys or pros would be getting paid what they're worth, I think it would be a more fair system. 

Dennis Berman:Let's make it commissioner for a moment, not that there is commissioner of college basketball, but we know that attendance is largely down, maybe not at Villanova, but college basketball generally, TV ratings not great, they are not doing so well. There is something amiss in the sport. 

Jay Wright:Right. 

Dennis Berman:What needs to be changed? 

Jay Wright:I think what you're talking about is the result of a lot more content on TV, all right. So people don't go as much because every game is on TV. I think that the TV ratings seem -- you know, you get so many games on you can't watch them all. So I don't think -- I don't think it's a miss, I think, when you see the NCA tournament and you see the passion for that event, when that starts to fade, if that event isn't what it is to our country, then I think something is wrong in college basketball. Because you can still watch games at the lower levels of division one, even division three, they still get great following. I think college basketball is alive and well. I think what we have to solve is there are certain guys who should be professionals and they're stuck going to college because of the rule. 

Dennis Berman:Who were you when you were a 25-year-old coach, and who are you today many years later? How have you changed? 

Jay Wright:25 years old, I was an assistant to Coach Massimino at Villanova and watching this great coach who won a national championship do some things and think, at 25, why the hell would he do that? You know, I've got all these ideas, you know, I would never do that. And all these years later, I find myself doing some of the same things. 

Dennis Berman:Turning into your father. 

Jay Wright:Yes. But understanding -- and I did understand some years before, if you look at anybody in any situation, it's not just his decisions, he's a part of something and that culture he's a part of dictates some of his decisions, and what you need to do as head coach is define your culture. If your culture is defined and your values are clear, your decisions are easier. And I found that, as a leader, what I have to do is define how we're going to live, not just how we're going to play basketball, but what is our -- what is our motto going to be? What is our core values going to be? How are we going to live every day not just as coaches and players but as a family and as men in this world? So I definitely changed my thinking a lot. 

Dennis Berman:So you're okay having become your professional father, more or less? (LAUGHTER) 

Jay Wright:A refined edition of my professional father. 

Dennis Berman:Fair enough. Last question. Championship or bust this year for Villanova? 

Jay Wright:No, not at all. We just -- we have to become the best team we can possibly be, given everything that goes on around us, and that's always been our goal. Last year, our goal wasn't win a national championship, it was be the best team we could be, and take on every challenge. And we did. But the year before, we did too, and we lost in the second round. And I'll be proud of our guys -- I told them that -- if we don't win it this year, but we give the effort and the commitment to be the best we can be, I'm good. 

Dennis Berman:"Attitude: Develop a Winning Mindset On and Off the Court," Jay Wright's new book. Thanks for joining. 

Jay Wright:Great talking with you, thanks. 

Jon Meacham:Good evening. I'm Jon Meacham, filling in for Charlie Rose. Omar Saif Ghobash is here. He is the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Russia. His new book is called "Letters to a Young Muslim." It consists of a series of personal correspondences to his older son. It seeks to answer the question of how moderate Muslims can find a voice that is true to Islam while engaging in the modern world. I am pleased to welcome the ambassador to this table. Welcome, sir. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Thank you very much. 

Jon Meacham:So, what was the origin of the letters to your son? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Well, the idea of sort of collecting a set of principles and concepts goes back quite a long way to the time when I was 15 -- 14, 15, and I was myself going through a phase of asking many different questions and not finding the answers in our culture. But there was a sense in which you couldn't pose those questions. What I noticed as time went by is the situation hadn't changed and I noticed exactly the same processes occurring in my older son and also my younger son and, so, I decided, you know, if nobody else had done it, then I should make my best effort to try to sort of put a kind of framework around those questions and try to explain how the possible answers might come about. 

Jon Meacham:Was there a literary example in your mind? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:No, as I said a couple of times before in private that my initial version was a kind of "Das Kapital" by Marx. (LAUGHTER) 

Jon Meacham:Shorter. (LAUGHTER) 

Omar Saif Ghobash:No, the original version was much longer. And so my editor said, look, wonderful, but you really should think about actually addressing people's concerns here, so she gave me the idea of addressing my son. I thought, that's fantastic. As soon as that happened, everything began to flow. Everything began to simplify itself. Actually, when I read the book -- when I reread it, I am really pleased with the way the language has kind of broken down into very basic elements here. 

Jon Meacham:Sure. Is this the way you talk to him? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:It is actually the way I talk to him. I talk to my younger son as well in the same manner. Of course, the subject matter will be slightly different, but I think it's important to be able to explain things in a fairly simple manner. And I think it was also something I was taught at university. Don't be enamored of long words. Try to express things as simply as possible. The ideas can be complex but the presentation should be easy. 

Jon Meacham:Right. Now, I admire you for having a 16 year old and a 14 year old who could listen to this. I have a 14 year old who I don't think would read a letter from me. (LAUGHTER) Tell me what was the most important message you wanted to get across? I mean, this is a complicated time in the Muslim world, a complicated time in the western world. There are still some who want to say that it's an enduring clash of civilizations. There are others who would like to see co-existence and reform be possible. What was the impetus? What's your message to them? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Well, my message is actually something about our personal responsibility within the faith. So people can talk about a clash of civilizations, so between civilizations, I think there is a clash within our own civilization, within our own Islamic community, and I think it's particularly worrisome and also kind of tantalizing in a way. There are 1.7 billion Muslims, and the kinds of ways in which we discuss issues with each other have not really progressed in the sense that there is a tremendous amount that is kept under wraps so that, you know, it takes place behind the scenes in private homes and so on. And I've received a certain amount of feedback from young Arabs and young Muslims and people as far away as Indonesia. And they tell me thank you for putting words on some of the feelings that I've had. Thank you for breaking a certain kind of taboo in speaking about so many issues. So I think that's very important. I want to demonstrate that all of these taboos are choices that we have made, our society's made these choices, and that we actually need to begin to legitimize the vast population that lives in fear of discussing their own issues. 

Jon Meacham:You -- what is your greatest fear for, say, your 16 year old, growing up in an Islamic world that has been given to extremism? Do you worry he would be surrounded by people who have been radicalized? Do you worry about his own susceptibility, potentially? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:In the case of my older son, no, I'm not particularly worried about him. There was a moment where I did worry that he was, you know, interested in the wrong ideas. Initially, you could think of it as curiosity, but when he began to defend those ideas, I thought it was maybe not so. 

Jon Meacham:Which wrong ideas? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:For example, the time when he got a copy of a biography of Osama bin Laden. He began to think, you know, perhaps he had point. But this is an extremely important issue and it takes me back to September 11, and the events on September 11 were tragic and evil and a crime. And it made me think very clearly that we must not as Arabs and Muslims, even if we think that we have been the victims of a crime, we shouldn't repay it with a crime. Because that just makes a nonsense of our ethical system. And so I felt that was extremely important. My son, you know, after a few weeks, dropped that idea and moved on. But he's representative of a certain category of young men or women who may look at certain actors within our world, within the Arab world and the Muslim world, and say, oh, well, these are really quite heroic fellows, they've made a big sacrifice. So I want to take all that negative energy and try to transform it into something much more constructive and productive. 

Jon Meacham:Why do you believe that Islam has been, broadly put, more resistant to the liberalization, the kind of appreciation of diversity that you argue for, that you allude to in the book? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Well, I don't think its anything intrinsic to Islam. I actually think that it's more of a cultural representation. We have fairly, let's say top-down autocratic systems, patriarchal systems in the Arab world. The Arab world is basically the heartland of Islam. It is the -- the Arabic language is the language in which Islam is transmitted. So I think that, you know, if we look more broadly across the Islamic world, what happens in the Arab world and the Arabic language will then transmit itself to the rest of the Islamic world. That's one thing. So when we look at the structures, the clerical structures within the Islamic world and the Arabic world, they're very, very top-down again, they're a kind of a self-replicating class of scholars. These are people who will spend 30, 50 years, or more, studying the Quran and studying the sayings of the prophets. And they've really devoted their lives to this. There is a certain point where you cannot challenge them, and part of the magic is that they teach young men and women that they are the ones who know, they are the kind of the keyholders or gatekeepers to our moral knowledge. And so that empowers them and essentially kind of creates a large group of people who have to submit to their authority. So what I am trying to do in the book is to say, more knowledge is within the access or within reach of anybody, and if -- what kind of religion do we have if we need to spend 50 years studying the religious text in order to come up with a moral position? And, you know, I've spoken to religious scholars about this and I said, I do not have a religious background, in the sense that I haven't been trained, but I believe I have the right as a human being to engage in moral discussion. And the answer was fairly negative. If you don't have the expertise, therefore you mustn't. 

Jon Meacham:To move to your diplomatic post for a moment. Where do you -- I know you're in Moscow but you've been here-- Where do you see America's view of Islam moving, particularly given our presidential election? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Yes, of course, I witnessed the Muslim ban, and I thought that was very interesting. My initial kind of response was that I look at the United States as a set of laws and a set of fundamental values all embodied in a constitution and a constitutional system that seems to be working, you know -- 

Jon Meacham:We're testing it, but yes. (LAUGHTER) 

Omar Saif Ghobash:But isn't that where we prove that it exists? 

Jon Meacham:Exactly. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Yes. So, for me, I think it's an exceptional lesson for the rest of the world where we have been told for the last two decades, the American democracy, the founding fathers, their genius, now this is demonstrating really be the practical outcomes of that genius. So I think, you know, it's very important for us to observe. I don't -- myself, you know, I don't take a personal position on the approach of the administration to the seven countries on the list of the ban. It just surprised me and a number of others that there was ever an expectation that we could get visas so easily to come to the U.S., you know. 

Jon Meacham:Right. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:There is an element of surprise there. 

Jon Meacham:Off this point, but again, tied to your diplomatic post, where do you see the Trump administration's relationship with Moscow at this point? Are you as puzzled as many of the rest of us? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Not entirely. I mean, my personal view from where I'm sitting in Moscow is that the entire relationship has been somewhat exaggerated and somewhat fictionalized. And has become more of a political football within American kind of establishment politics. 

Jon Meacham:You mean the tensions have been exaggerated or the relationship? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:The supposed relationship that Trump and his -- 

Jon Meacham:Yes, the Trump-Putin relationship, alleged relationship. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Yes, exactly. You know, my other reading of the situation is that with so much kind of -- with so much inability to see where the administration is going, I think the Russians will probably behave in a way that suggests that they're not expecting anything from the Americans anyway. 

Jon Meacham:Got it. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Yes, so. 

Jon Meacham:What's the reaction to the book? First of all, what was your son's reaction? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Great pride. My youngest son is reading 15 pages a day and he's loving it. My older son has -- he came across a couple of the chapters that upset him quite a bit, particularly about my father's passing. So that put him off. But I have -- I don't want to pressure him to read, but I have asked him to read the book in the next few weeks. 

Jon Meacham:Tell us the story of your dad. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:My father, wonderful man. Precocious child, very, very smart. At the age of 12, he was giving sermons in the mosque. At age 14, he had -- I think this was in probably 1948, '49, he had already become a Marxist communist. Very, very interesting kind of background. He then spent some time in Iraq trying to get an education, didn't have any money. Finally, in his 30s, he was offered a scholarship to the Soviet Union to get a university education. He did that. He married my mother there. That's why I'm half Russian, half Emirati. Or 100 percent Emirati, half Arab. (LAUGHTER) 

Jon Meacham:Be careful, that's right. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Yes. He was minister of state for foreign affairs and I think in '74, '77 he was killed in a terrorist incident in Abu Dhabi. And what makes it doubly tragic was that it was an accidental killing. The person beside him was the intended target. 

Jon Meacham:And the effect of losing him so young on you? 

Omar Saif Ghobash:You know, I don't want to feel sorry for myself, but it's coming up to 40 years and it's something that I will carry with me till the end of my life. What I did notice was that my relationship to my father's passing had knock-on effects on my children. 

Jon Meacham:Sure. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:And I noticed this with my nieces and nephews and I had a chat with my brothers and sister and I said, you know, we really need to put an end to this pain. We really need to make a stand and say, you know, an incident that happened 40 years ago should not now begin to cripple our children. So it makes me empathize tremendously with other victims of violence, whether it's domestic or political or religious violence. I think it's exceptionally important that we all stand and push back against this strange kind of theology of violence we're finding in the Arab world. 

Jon Meacham:Absolutely. Let me ask you to read the closing, your closing note. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Thank you very much. 

Jon Meacham:To your sons. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Yes. In ending these letters to you, Saif, I want you to promise yourself that you will always maintain your dignity, your individuality, and your independence of mind. If you can do this, you will be likelier to see life for what it is and what it can be. You will be the decider of your own path. You should also insist on discerning the dignity, individuality, and independence of mind in others. By presuming others are similarly endowed, you will create the space for them to rise to the challenge, to express themselves, and to live up to our highest standards. Now go and write your own letters. (LAUGHTER) Thank you very much. 

Jon Meacham:Thank you. The book is "Letters to a Young Muslim." Thank you, Ambassador Ghobash. 

Omar Saif Ghobash:Thank you. 

Jon Meacham:Good luck with it.
