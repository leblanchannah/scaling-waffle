Dennis Berman:Good evening. I'm Dennis Berman filling in for Charlie Rose. Donald Trump swept to the White House on a promise to improve the lives of those left behind by the financial crisis and other changes overtaking the economy. He has also pledged to revoke and replace Barack Obama's signature achievement as president, the Affordable Care Act. But the hurdles to achieving this ambition appear increasingly challenging for President Trump. Joining me from Washington is David Leonhardt, a columnist for the "New York Times," and he writes about the problems facing the president's effort to dismantle Obamacare in today's "Times." Also joining me is William Cohan, here in New York, he's a special correspondent for "Vanity Fair," and author of a provocative newly-titled book, "Why Wall Street Matters." I note that we are taping this program before President Trump's address to Congress later this evening. David, let's get started with you. You mentioned in your column basically that the Republicans are backed into a corner on Obamacare. What do you mean? 

David Leonhardt:Well President Obama's health law was actually a very politically moderate health law. It was market-based. It took ideas that have come from both the right and the left. And it essentially said we're going to expand coverage for people, but we're going do it in this market-based way. It was to the right of not only Bill Clinton's plan. It was to the right of Richard Nixon's plan. It was way to the right of Harry Truman's plan. And so, if you want to expand health insurance coverage, it's really hard to do it in a way that's a lot more conservative than Obamacare. And Republicans did a very effective job politically of blasting Obamacare. But now that they're actually running government, they've realized that getting rid of Obamacare and also keeping their other promises, which is not throwing people off of healthcare and not causing prices to go up, is actually enormously difficult. And they still may do it and decide they're willing to accept throwing people off of healthcare, but they're struggling right now. 

Dennis Berman:David, you mentioned the term magical promises of Trump. What is specifically magical by your reckoning? 

David Leonhardt:I mean, he's had several lines where he's basically said this version of we're going to cover everyone, the coverage is going to be better and it's going to be cheaper. And, you know, people -- economists like to say there is no such thing as a free lunch, right? That you can't both cover everybody and have everything be cheaper. Or if you did, it would require really hard choices about getting rid of waste in the healthcare system that led to the whole debate over death panels. And so, neither Trump nor the congressional Republicans have ever said, look, what we're going to do is we are going to cut taxes, but that also means we're going to have to cut benefits, or we're going to raise taxes and raise benefits. They've sort of just pretended that they could have it all. And when they weren't governing, they were able to do that. But now that they're actually in charge, it's proven particularly difficult. And the Republican governors are really interesting to watch here because they actually have to run states. And what we saw this weekend, when they came together was they said, wait a second here, we don't want you throwing a lot of our citizens off health insurance, and those are the kind of tensions that Republicans are now trying to figure out how to solve. 

Dennis Berman:All right, let's bring in Bill Cohan. Thanks for joining us. Bill, there seems to be a somewhat of a predicament for many of the ideas promised by the Trump administration prior to the inauguration and after. Lots of great promises, the market believes it. What can we expect in terms of the market realities hitting the policy realities from your vantage point? 

Unknown Speaker:So, of course, you know, we all think back to election eve when it looked like Trump was going to win, and did win, the market futures fell about a thousand points. And I think everybody thought it would just go downhill from there. As many people have said, I think it's remarkable that the fact the opposite has happened. The pundits were kind of wrong. The market is now approaching 21,000. I can only imagine what the reaction among Americans would be if the market had in fact fallen to 14,000 instead of rising to 21,000. I think Donald Trump has gotten a lot of political mileage and economic mileage out of the fact that the markets have risen so dramatically, so quickly, and we are still talking about this Trump bump. The question is in my mind is when does it stop? I mean, obviously, we know it's not going to go on forever, and never does. But the question is when will people sort of come to terms with the fact that the trees don't grow to heaven, and I think it's going to start when, as David was talking about, if Obamacare does not get repealed and the costs related to that, the costs of this proposed new budget that we're beginning to hear more and more about, what if he can't repeal some of the regulations that he's talked about repealing? What if he can't get the tax cuts that he's talked about, that he's promised? What if he can't repatriate these trillions of dollars from overseas? I mean, when his reality of governing hits up against the promises that he made, then I think people are going to say, hold it, whoa, we may need to re-think this stock market reaction here. 

Dennis Berman:David, you know both business and politics, what are the limits of reality and actual progress economically based on the Trump agenda as you see it? 

David Leonhardt:I mean, I think we shoved some real skepticism that the market is reacting to what's going on with Trump either way. You know, we had a stock market boom for the vast majority of Obama's presidency. We had stocks rising when everyone, including people in the market thought Hillary Clinton was going to be elected. Then there was that little gyration when Trump was elected, and now the market has gone back to booming even more so. And so, I think the effect that any individual president has on the market is relatively limited. And I think it's possible that the market boom could end even if Trump's agenda succeeds. And I think it's possible that the market boom could continue even if his agenda falls apart. I mean, I think one of the lessons is we as citizens give presidents way too much credit for the economy and too much blame. It wasn't actually George H.W. Bush's fault we had a recession in the early '90s, et cetera. I think the question is, is the Trump administration doing the kinds of things that are likely to lift growth? I'm skeptical of that. 

Dennis Berman:Why are you skeptical, David? Give us three quick examples, if you could. 

David Leonhardt:I mean, the basic notion that the way to turbo charge growth is to cut taxes and to have less regulation. If you look over the last 50 years, there isn't evidence one way or the other. Yes, growth surged after Ronald Reagan did that, but growth was really weak after George W. Bush did it. And growth was even faster under Bill Clinton, who regulated and raised taxes, than under Ronald Reagan. And so, I looked at all that evidence and I say, you know what, I don't think modest changes or even significant changes in the tax rate are the primary drivers or even significant drivers of growth. These things are more unrelated than they are related. 

Dennis Berman:So, if nothing matters, David, then what does matter when it comes to the American economy? 

David Leonhardt:Well, things certainly matter. I think long-term, there's absolutely no question that education matters. I don't think anything matters as much as education, and the skills of a workforce long term. That's not a year-to-year thing. Year-to-year thing, I think we know much less about the economy. I think we know the fed is really important. And I think we know avoiding financial crisis are really important. I think the odds of a financial crisis anytime in the next few years are relatively low, but I do worry a little bit that we could be seeing some signs of excess. And we saw a decade ago that not caring about regulation is not a particularly great way to avoid financial crisis. 

Dennis Berman:Bill, you wrote a book, Why Wall Street Matters. Do you agree with David? It sounds like he's taking a pretty centrist view there. 

Unknown Speaker:I don't want to be put in a position of disagreeing with David, but I'm going to a little bit here. I do think tone matters. I do think some policies do matter. When you, just as a pure mathematical calculation, if you increase corporate profits by reducing taxes, for instance, then, as you know, the price-to-earnings ratio that the market is of course driven on, will, you know -- the stock market will go up because earnings have gone up. You don't even have to expand the multiple on that for that to happen. And I think some of the reason why the stock market has gone to 21,000 is the expectation that those tax rates will be cut, corporate tax rates, which are obviously the highest in the western world and probably need to be lowered, although I'm not sure why, but that seems to be something that people talk about or are excited about. And I think that's part of the reason why the stock market has gone up. You know, when you deregulate, I mean, look, the pendulum swings, right? You know, the Clinton administration at the end, you know, took off Glass-Steagall and, you know, it was a free-for-all basically. 

Dennis Berman:The law that governed how banks were regulated. 

Unknown Speaker:Whether they could be both in the investment banking business and the commercial banking business. And, you know, under Christopher Cox, the surfer congressman who was chairman of the SEC during the George Bush administration, you know, all sense of regulation was taking off. And basically, it was like Wall Street was driving on the wrong side of the road with a Ferrari and a whiskey bottle in their hand. And no surprise we got into a huge financial crisis in 2008. Now we're in a position where I think there's been too much regulation, too much sand thrown in the gears of the left ventricle of capitalism if you will, this beautiful machine. And now we're in a position where Donald Trump is saying, hey, we're going to take all of this off. I think there needs to be some sort of grand bargain with Wall Street, where there is a corresponding agreement from Wall Street that we're going to reform our compensation system, so that our incentives on Wall Street are just not to reward people for taking big risks with other people's money. If you take off all regulation and let people gamble with other people's money, then you're literally asking for a financial crisis. And that's where I disagree with David a little bit. I think if we don't marry a grand bargain of compensation reform and incentive reform on Wall Street with this deregulation, you are virtually guaranteed a financial crisis. 

Dennis Berman:So from a legislative standpoint, your best tweaks would be, from your perspective, what? 

David Leonhardt:I think it depends what the goal is. I think if the goal is long-term growth, then I think you want to make sure that you're not running up long-term deficits. So I'm concerned that the whole focus of the Trump administration is on the discretionary budget, and there is no focus at all on social security and Medicare, which is where all of our long-term fiscal challenges come. I'm concerned that we seem to be disinvesting in things like science, education, that we know fuel long-term growth. So I think there are lots of things that matter. My skepticism is whether we can draw a straight line from most of these policies to the economy next quarter or the stock market this month. 

Dennis Berman:All right. The deficit question is an important one, I think, to bring up. If we look at the numbers the U.S. GDP -- or the debt to GDP is around 110 percent, which is a rather incredible number. We've gotten used to it over the last ten years, Bill. But back prior to that in the aughts, we were at about 60 to 70 percent. So how does the budget deficit factor in politically and economically? 

Unknown Speaker:I think this is, you know, the sort of Damocles hanging over the Trump administration because all that he's talking about so far, again, the nonpartisan tax policy center has examined Trump's proposals and said that the national debt is going to go from 20 trillion, which you know he railed against constantly, is going to go from 20 trillion to 27 trillion, we're going to look more like Greece and Japan on a debt to GDP ratio before long. We're already starting to get there, 110 percent from 60 percent is mind boggling. But, you know, we've had some big wars and they're very expensive. And we do seem to be comfortable with the national debt, and interest rates have been so low. So that's the market basically saying we're comfortable with your high debt to GDP ratio, but at some point something has to give. You can't give all the toys away for free and not expect to have to pay for them. 

Dennis Berman:David, you're on the ground in Washington. Are the Republicans willing to go further on the deficit than they have previously to get some of Trump's agenda passed in perhaps the ways they weren't comfortable before? 

David Leonhardt:I think it's unlikely. I mean, I think what we've seen from congressional Republicans is their number one priority on fiscal matters is cutting tax rates, cutting top tax rates, cutting taxes for companies and for higher-income individuals. That's a higher priority for them than the deficit. My guess is that will continue. They're in a tricky spot right now because the way they've lined this up legislatively and procedurally, healthcare has to come before taxes. They actually, I think, have an easier path to a Republican deal on taxes than on healthcare, but they can't get to healthcare without either passing healthcare first or abandoning it. And you saw the president lament this yesterday the fact that healthcare comes first. And so, that's going to be one of the really interesting things to watch today, abandon healthcare or do they come to a deal on healthcare which lets them get to taxes. And I think Republicans whether it's a good idea or not, I'm a little skeptical. I think Republicans will be able to agree to a deal. They will substantially cut high-end taxes, and will also substantially increase the deficit. There's a lot of Republican agreement around that idea. 

Dennis Berman:Doesn't that go against a lot of Republican views for the last few decades? 

Unknown Speaker:The catechism of the Republican economic platform has been deficit reduction, reducing the debt, and now we're talking about as if those things don't matter. It's mind boggling to me. 

Dennis Berman:What do the Republicans say, David, to someone in his or her district, exactly what Bill is saying. I've been preaching this for a long time. What's the argument? 

David Leonhardt:I mean, Americans aren't that worried about the deficit right now. And I don't think they're crazy to be focused in the medium term on other issues. I mean, I would argue that wage stagnation, I would argue that the rise in non-employment that isn't even captured by the unemployment rate, I would actually argue all those things are more serious immediate issues than the deficit. I think the deficit is a really serious long-term issue. But I don't think at this point there's a huge political price to pay for raising the deficit. The question is how do voters react when they see that the deficit was going up, and the reason it was going up was to deliver tax cuts to people who are already doing very well. And I don't know what the answer to that is going to be, but, boy, I'm confident the Democrats are going to run on that in the midterms if that's what the Republicans do. 

Dennis Berman:Let's run out here with one question for each of you. There were a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump, and they had grievances about the way the economy was headed. For people who don't pay attention to all this stuff we're talking about, but who care about what's in their pocketbook, what's the single most important thing they should be paying attention to right now, Bill? 

Unknown Speaker:In my mind, it's how Donald Trump deregulates Wall Street. How he deregulates business generally, and how he sort of unleashes the power of our economic engine, you know, and allowing capital to flow to small businesses that need it, to hire more people, to build new plants and equipment, to pay people higher wages, that is the single best way, I think, that the people who were so concerned about the way they've been treated, and who voted for Donald Trump, they're going to get the greatest benefit when that economic engine is starting to run properly again. 

Dennis Berman:David, I'll put the question to you. For people who don't care who David Leonhardt is or what he says, what's the thing they need to be most focused on? 

David Leonhardt:And to be clear, I think a lot of these grievances are legitimate. I think people are right to be angry about how the economy has done. Look, I think in the short term, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, I think they should care about health insurance because it's a huge driver of bankruptcy. And if we go back to the system where if you don't get it through your job, you don't have health insurance, we're talking about huge numbers of people who could be subject to bankruptcy. In the longer term, I would encourage them, don't just look at Washington. Look at your local school district. We were saying -- I was saying before that nothing affects long term growth and a community's living standards like education. So there is so much focus on Washington. For people who don't care about the week-to-week stuff in Washington, focus on how well your school district is doing because that will have a huge effect on the quality of your children's lives long term. 

Dennis Berman:All right, David Leonhardt, from "New York Times" in Washington, thanks so much for joining us. Bill Cohan, always a pleasure to chat with you. 

Unknown Speaker:Thank you.
