Charlie Rose:The nominees and winners at this year's National Book Awards represented a cross-culture of today's literary scene, from Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full to Alice McDermott's (sp? ) Charming Billy (sp? ) to Edward Ball's Slaves in the Family. But there was one thing many of these authors had in common: editor >>JONATHAN GALASSI. The list of writers he has worked with reads like a best-seller list: Scott Turow, Pat Conroy, Seamus Heaney (sp? ), Susan Sonntag. They run the gamut in terms of style, but are at the top of their form in terms of substance. And they all credit their success in no small part to this man. He joins me now to talk about the art of editing and the state of publishing in America today, and I am very pleased to have him here. And I say that making this point, that not only is he a great editor, but he also is a writer. He is, in fact, a poet, and this is The Collected Poems, 1920-1954, translated and annotated by JONATHAN GALASSI, but he also is a poet himself. Welcome to this program. 

Jonathan Galassi:Thank you, Charlie. 

Charlie Rose:Poetry your first love? 

Jonathan Galassi:It is. It's the thing that got me most interested in words because poetry is language at its most concentrated, at its most formal, at its deep-- it goes deepest. But poetry is-- demands a special kind of attention that you can't do all the time, and other kinds of writing are equally valuable and exciting. And I've been lucky to spend my working life with writers' words. It's really fun. 

Charlie Rose:I said ''Galeessi'' rather than Galassi. My apologies to you, but I assume everybody knows what I was-- what I meant. Might you have become a poet and nothing else? 

Jonathan Galassi:I don't think that a poet is a-- is a job-- is a day job. (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--get to teach. 

Jonathan Galassi:Yeah, teach-- then teaching is the day job. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jonathan Galassi:Poetry is something that's more vocational than it is professional-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jonathan Galassi:I think. 

Charlie Rose:Or you'd have to be a writer of prose. There's always something else in addition to poetry. 

Jonathan Galassi:That's right. 

Charlie Rose:Simply because there's not that much demand for it, so that you can make a living? 

Jonathan Galassi:That's right. I think it's not-- it's not-- it's not a commercial entity, and that's part of its value, in a way, is that it's a-- it's apart from commercial considerations, and that's part of the attraction of it for-- in many ways. 

Charlie Rose:How is America, you know-- how does it stand as a country that appreciates and admires poetry? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, poetry is not on the-- at the forefront of what people think about when they think about literature, but the fact is that, you know, we're a very pluralistic society, and there are lots of different pockets of our culture where poetry is of vital interest to a lot of different people. 

Charlie Rose:I meant it almost as a comparative question. Is it more popular in Europe than it is in the United States, more popular in Asia, more popular in Latin America, more popular-- 

Jonathan Galassi:In Russia, for instance, poetry is-- poets are national figures, and in Poland, too, I think. But there are lots of other countries where they say-- you know, the editors I meet say, ''Well, you're-- you-- there's much more going on in poetry in America than in our country.'' So it varies with different cultures. 

Charlie Rose:And there are poetry readings happening in this city tonight somewhere. 

Jonathan Galassi:Everywhere. Everywhere some-- there is something going on with poetry. And in New York, there's always several things going on. 

Charlie Rose:How did you get from-- to be an editor? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, I wanted to be involved with contemporary literature. I didn't want to be an academic. And I knew some people who had been in publishing, and I decided to give it a try. And I worked to find a job. I finally found one and-- 

Charlie Rose:What was the first job? 

Jonathan Galassi:I was an intern in the editorial department of Houghton-Mifflin Company, an old-line Boston company, in Boston. 

Charlie Rose:And what was the first book you edited? 

Jonathan Galassi:Oh, the first book I edited was-- well, one of the first books I edited was a book called The Chasm by Robert Campbell (sp? ), which was about the Ocean Hill (sp? ), Brownsville schools and the upheavals there in the late '60s. One of the first books-- manuscripts I ever got to read was a novel by Robert Stone, Dog Soldiers, and that was-- CHARLIE I remember that. That was top-of-the-line. It took me a lot of years to find another book as good as that. I didn't discover it. I just had the chance of reading it. 

Charlie Rose:Now, what does that mean, had a chance of reading it? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, not-- it had-- it was already under contract to the company, and they asked people to read it to get their impressions. So I-- as a junior, I got to read it, and I was bowled over by-- (crosstalk) Yeah, that was-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:Then you went to Random House? 

Jonathan Galassi:Yes, in the early '80s, I was at Random House for five years. And then I left there in the mid-'80s, and I went to Farrar, Straus & Giroux, where I've been ever since. It's a small, more literary publishing house, and we publish a lot of different writers. We like to say we publish writers, authors, rather than specific books. We like to have long continuity with our authors. 

Charlie Rose:Well, I just mentioned Tom Wolfe, Alice McDermott and Edward Ball. Alice McDermott-- so one of your writers beat out another of your writers for the National Book Award nomination. 

Jonathan Galassi:Yes. That was-- that was a-- how shall I put it-- a potentially awkward situation that turned out to be just fine. Everyone was-- was pretty happy. 

Charlie Rose:Everybody's okay? 

Jonathan Galassi:Yes. 

Charlie Rose:It was one of those things, ''If it can't be me, I'd rather be it be Tom.'' Tom saying, ''If it can't be me, I'd rather it be Alice,'' that kind of thing? 

Jonathan Galassi:Yeah, they were both very-- very courteous about each other. 

Charlie Rose:Because you were worried for a moment there that this might be tension. 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, it's just-- it's something where you want all-- you want all your children to get all A's in school. 

Charlie Rose:Excluding the Nobel, okay, what's the best and biggest and most impressive thing a writer can earn as an award, not as a best-seller, but as an award, as a recognition of merit? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, there are different ones. The Pulitzer is a very long-established prize, which is given by journalists, really. It's maybe the oldest. The National Book Award is a very important and increasingly more-- has more impact on sales. Then there are things like MacArthur fellowship, which is a five-year grant of big money, where people-- 

Charlie Rose:I guess my question was more specific. I was hoping you'd give me an answer that would be-- is it the Pulitzer or is it the National Book Award? 

Jonathan Galassi:Oh. Well, I think they're both very, very important, and there are other prizes, too, like the National Book Critics' Circle Prize, and different ones. So there isn't one exact winner. In England, there's the Booker Prize for fiction, which-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Right. 

Jonathan Galassi:--is sort of the ne plus ultra there. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, we just had one of the winners over here on this program who wrote-- 

Jonathan Galassi:The sells books in America now, too. 

Charlie Rose:The fact that you win the Booker is-- brings a sort of identification to you-- 

Jonathan Galassi:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:--when you come to America. 

Jonathan Galassi:Prizes are starting to mean more in terms of selling books. 

Charlie Rose:Did you read Amsterdam? 

Jonathan Galassi:I haven't read it yet. I have it-- 

Charlie Rose:It's a great book. 

Jonathan Galassi:--but I haven't read it. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Editing-- are editors like football coaches, they come in all kinds in terms of how they go about getting the job done? 

Jonathan Galassi:That's right. Definitely. Some editors are very, very pencil-intensive, you know, where they-- they put their-- put their mark on the page. And others are more laid back and strategizing. 

Charlie Rose:Strategizing what? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, just listening to the author talk about the book, reading it and then reacting. It all depends on what the author wants and needs. Many authors like to have that kind of intense feedback. Others want something more-- more restrained. It all depends on the degree of experience, too, that the authors have. 

Charlie Rose:The more experience, the more what? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, they're-- some authors, you know, when they get to be celebrated, people are sometimes very reluctant to criticize them or to give them suggestions because-- because who are you to tell X, you know, how to improve his or her book? 

Charlie Rose:Or said another way, ''How many National Book Awards do you have?'' 

Jonathan Galassi:Exactly. But I've actually found that as long as you're-- as long as you understand or-- and you're respectful of what's going on, they're very responsive to people really-- really talking to them about their books. 

Charlie Rose:I assume you could argue the following, too. The more secure they get and confident they are, maybe because of awards, because of whatever, best-sellers, the more likely they are to welcome suggestions because they're confident in who they are. 

Jonathan Galassi:Yes, I think that's right. And the editor's job is to try to do whatever he can to bring out the ideal form of that book. You know, if a book is-- it's like a sculpture that's inside a block of stone that you're-- the sculptor tries to make the whole thing come out without any waste, without any errors at all. With a book, sometimes there are things that haven't quite be sculpted exactly fully. That's what an editor's there for. 

Charlie Rose:To spot them and say, ''You need to sculpt more here''? 

Jonathan Galassi:Just to say, ''What about that?'' you know, or-- often, if I make a suggestion, sometimes often I don't expect the author to respond to that particular suggestion, but it will lead the author to do something else. It's just like pointing to a little spot and saying, ''Well, what about that?'' 

Charlie Rose:The future of the publishing business, then, is what? Is bright? 

Jonathan Galassi:I think it-- I think you'd have to say that publishing, as we know it now, is what they call a ''mature business.'' I don't think it's-- 

Charlie Rose:There's no room for explosive growth. 

Jonathan Galassi:I don't think-- I don't see explosive growth, but I think it's going to maintain. I think that books have an irreplaceable place in people's lives, that it's going to change certainly during our lifetime or our children's lifetime. 

Charlie Rose:Take a book like A Man in Full. Does that-- when did you get the first inquiry about a movie? Or is that handled through the agent? 

Jonathan Galassi:That's handled through the agent-- 

Charlie Rose:Okay. 

Jonathan Galassi:--so we don't deal with the movie, but I'm sure-- 

Charlie Rose:Early on, you didn't-- 

Jonathan Galassi:I'm sure that-- 

Charlie Rose:Even though you were editing it before he was even finished. You didn't have anybody calling you up saying, ''Tell me.'' 

Jonathan Galassi:Oh, people call, but I always refer them to the agent. That's not my job in that particular case. 

Charlie Rose:If you could change one thing about the publishing business, what would it be? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, that's a hard-- I guess I would-- I wish that the concentration of attention would not be on so few books, that there'd be a bigger spread of-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, that's the ageless argument, is that-- 

Jonathan Galassi:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:--the best-sellers get all the attention. 

Jonathan Galassi:Yeah. And and that's-- and again-- 

Charlie Rose:And all the marketing-- and all the marketing dollar. 

Jonathan Galassi:As one of the authors that we're about to publish, Tom Friedman is doing a book on globalization and how-- 

Charlie Rose:Guess where his first appearance is going to be? 

Jonathan Galassi:Oh. Good. Yeah, that's-- that-- he-- one of the things he says in the book is how one of the effects of globalization is that a few products get all the attention, the centralizing of-- and that's-- that's unfortunate because books are really a pluralistic product. You know, we don't just publish one book, we publish several hundred books. 

Charlie Rose:How come you're interested in Eugene Elmantali (sp? )? 

Jonathan Galassi:Well, I learned about-- well, partly because my grandfather was Italian, and I went to Italy. I learned Italian. I became aware of his poetry, and I just fell in love with it. It was something that just spoke to me personally in a very deep way. 

Charlie Rose:On behalf of every human being sitting at home, trying to write their first novel or their first book, what's your advice? 

Jonathan Galassi:I would say aim as high as possible. Do-- follow what you really believe. Don't think of the market, think of what you want to convey. And if you really can reach what you feel deeply, then there-- you will have a success. That's what I think. 

Charlie Rose:Thank you. A pleasure. 

Jonathan Galassi:Thank you. JONATHAN GALASSI, the subject of a recent profile in The New York Times is executive vice president for Farrar, Straus & Giroux. He's editor-in-chief of the same firm.
