Born and raised in New York City, Jame Caan has big dreams of leaving his families meat business. He entered Michigan State University with hopes of playing football but he wound up acting at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. In 1972 he had some year with an Academy Award nomination for the Godfather and Emmy nomination for Brian's Song Caan was firmly placed among the top stars of the decade. After a five year screen absence in the 80s Caan had hits with films like Misery and Honeymoon in Vegas. His latest role is the upcoming Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie called Eraser. I am pleased to have him here for the first time. Welcome. 

Thank you Charlie. 

My pleasure. Let me just sort of talk about the life that you have lived. 

Okay. 

We can talk for a couple of hours. 

What the heck. Is there anybody taping? I've got to watch myself. 

Well maybe, there may be a couple of machines around here. We may even had a few clips. This is your life. Growing up in Queens, you wanted to be a football player. You wanted to be an athlete. 

Yeah, basically. My neighborhood was not conducive to the arts. It was, there weren't too many dancers and singers. No actors. My family being in the meat business. 

Kosher meat business. 

No, it wasn't really. I think that's something else they write down there. They had the wrong year and we sold any kind of meat. 

(crosstalk). Yeah, that's right. If you wanted meat you could sell it. But that was not for you. As much as your admired your family you had other ideas. 

Oh yeah. I went to Michigan State when I was 16. 

16? 

Yeah, it wasn't because I was bright. It was because -- 

Did you skip a couple of grades? 

The high school couldn't wait to get me out. It's just like advance him. We can't deal with him any longer. I wanted to play football. As a matter of fact, I saw Duffy Daugherty who was my coach then. I saw him about 16 years later at a racetrack. He used to love to go to the racetrack. He moved out to Santa Barbara. 

By that time you were a movie star. 

I was in the movies, yes, whatever. He was sitting with Johnny Majors and Bud Christensen. I hadn't seen him in 16 years and I walked up and he goes, "Here's one of my dummies." I said, "Hi coach." He said, "I ought to get 10 percent of your career." I go, "Why is that?" He says, "I told you to quit playing football," which he did. 

You then came back to New York to go to the Playhouse. 

I transferred from, I got home when I was 16. I went to (inaudible) for a year. Switched majors. I had gone through just about everything there was to go through. The meat market every looming. 

Across the river. 

Going down to 14th street with my pop and lugging hind quarters. I don't think this is something I really want to do at 4 or 5 in the morning. You know, to get in the freezer to get warm. We'd go in the freezer to get warm. A last ditch effort, and thank God my dad was understanding, I went to the Neighborhood Playhouse. 

Which is about as good as you could go at that time. 

Yeah, I guess they let me in. I went there two weeks before school started. Usually you have to go through a year but they said, "Well, this guy must be nuts." They let me enter. 

Who was there with you? 

Dabney Coleman, Chris Lloyd, Jeanie Hale, Liz Ashley, I can't remember them all and I'm going to, you're probably going to get me in trouble. 

Okay, you'll forget somebody that ought to be with you. 

I forgot everybody. I have this problem. 

You forget. 

Yep. 

Let me go to 1972. I'm leaping ahead. 

Oh, good. That's a good jump, yeah, out of the meat market. 

How did you get the Godfather job, because everybody talks about the hiring of Pacino? I guess either Robert Evans didn't want him or Francis didn't want him or you didn't want him. 

Oh yeah. Well the whole studio, no Francis definitely wanted him. 

Francis wanted him. 

Yeah. It's a great story because it's like it probably typifies the movie industry. It's like failing upwards, you know. When Francis got the job, at first I was friendly with Evans. They were looking at (inaudible). 

The director? 

Yeah, and I suggested Fran because Francis is a Mediterranean Italian, you know. In other words his father is the lead flutist for Tuscany and he was into film. It was more Mediterranean than that New York Italian that you connect with the Godfather. When he got the job he flew Bobby Duvall, Pacino, myself, and Brando. We went up there and for the price of like four corn beef sandwiches Eleanor, his wife, put a bowl on our head and gave us a haircut and we did some improvisations. That was his cast. That was like with 16 mm film. It cost about $8. 

And was this up to San Francisco? 

Yes, up in his place in San Francisco. So that was the cast. That's all we knew. About two months go by and I get a call in the middle of the night from Francis, who was in New York. He tells me, he says, "Jimmy, we want you to come in a test." I said, "Test what? What you got a Porsche you want me to drive around the block?" He said, "No, they want you to play Michael." I go, "What are you?" I could tell he was disgusted. 

All the talk before had you playing Sonny. 

Yeah, I was playing Sonny, Al was playing Michael and Bobby was -- 

And all of a sudden they wanted you to test for Michael. 

For some reason Al at that point in his life, I don't know if whether he was destructive or whatever his tests were not up to par and he would just come in and do it. They didn't want him. They also told Francis that if he mentioned Brando again he would be fired. These are those great geniuses at that time. I came into New York and they literally had, I don't know where it was on 59th, some studio. There was every actor that you could possibly imagine. From guys from Spain, from Ireland with accents, and everybody was playing Michael. I mean Francis was like beside himself. Guys were sitting on concrete floors. Of course (inaudible). They did it for two days. As a matter of fact there's a book that Mario Puzo wrote, it's called The Making of the Godfather, and there's one line he said in there. He said if Caan had had boobs he'd have played Kay. (crosstalk) everything. Then Francis kept sneaking Al in at the end of the day to do another test and they went nuts. The truth is, the upshot is of course after all that money spent, we wound up with the same cast that we had for the price of four corned beef sandwiches. 

They didn't have confidence that Al could deliver. That he was right for the role. 

I don't know what it was with Al but Francis, and Francis had this whole concept. I mean he wanted Sonny to be more Americanized, more Americanized looking, and Al be more the Italian looking of the brothers, you know. I knew he had this whole concept. I knew what Francis wanted. They came in and asked me to test the next day I just got on the train and left. I just left. 

Bobby Duvall told me on this program he knew it was going to be a great movie. That you guys knew. Did you know? 

You know what, we did know. I don't think anybody really ever knows because you look at some of these movies that are successful and you go, "My God, they are awful." 

YOu've been in some of those. 

You bet. Thanks Charlie. You're a hell of a good guy. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've been in my share, yes. The truth is what we did know was we were having a good time. Somehow that correlates to success. 

It's on the screen. 

Having a good time, yeah. I mean Bobby's like the best. Al was great. Brando, I don't care what anybody tells you, that was like everybody's idol, us growing up, going to acting school. Francis was at his peak. He was the best writer/director that I've ever known at that time. He's since gone to other things. 

Making wine. 

And then Gordy Willis. Just all the ingredients were there. 

Gordy Willis was the cinematographer? 

Yes, yeah. I mean we knew there was good stuff going on. You could feel it, you know, the actors. 

How did you prepare for it? Did you know any of the guys? 

I ate special fruit, Charlie, grown only in the jungles of Peru. 

Yeah, that was for Apocalypse Now that you didn't make. 

Well, the wanted me to. You wouldn't pay me. 

We'll get to that. Your life is defined as much by what you didn't do as what you did. 

Oh, yeah, I have a great story. You know oddly enough -- 

You knew some guys? 

Well I grew with, I mean I grew up at the neighborhood but oddly enough I was really fishing around. Quite often people don't, you can't correlate what my preparation was to that character Sonny. One day I'd already shot a scene and I was really fishing. I was uncomfortable. It was a scene where Sollozzo comes up and makes this proposition that the oil company where my dad and I speak out. I speak out of turn and my father lectures me. I knew there was something wrong. I went home and the next morning I woke up and I just for whatever reason I started behaving like Don Rickles. Now I know that sounds weird but all of a sudden it was like I came in and I just busted everybody's stones from the producer, "Why don't you get that cleaned. You've worn that seven days in a row." You know, "Here's some money." I just started being Don Rickles. That was it. 

Francis said to you, he'd have to encourage you I guess. 

Excuse me? 

Francis would encourage you saying that works, that's good. 

Yeah, it wasn't like I had to tell anybody what was going on inside, but it was that and through that was lots of improvisation coming out. Francis was wonderful because there was so many things that were improvised. I remember this one scene where we got outside at the wedding and the FBI guys are taking down all the license numbers. That was when Richie (Costalano) was walking with me. These guys they had these old cameras and they are taking pictures. We are walking back after I spit at the FBI guys or whatever, I came back and for whatever reason, I don't know what came over me, but this guy took my picture. Just a simple guy who was paid to do that. I grabbed this guy. I took his camera and I smashed it on the ground. I pulled him up against the car. Richie was right in the scene. It wasn't written. He pulled me off, "Come on Sonny, Sonny." I remember when I was a kid it was all right as long as you paid the guy and I took out a couple of tens and I threw them on the ground like you know. It was okay, Francis loved that. The stick too. I put that in my car when I threw it at the guy. That wasn't in the movie. 

It just happened. 

Yeah, guys like Bobby and Al and stuff like that, it was great. I mean it was just wonderful. 

Here's a clip from the Godfather, James Caan, Al Pacino, directed by Francis Copolla. 

You want me to hang around? 

Yeah, hang around. You all right? 

Yeah, I'm fine. 

Yeah. There's some food in the icebox. You hungry or anything? 

No, it's all right. 

How about a drink, a little brandy? That's good to sweat it out. 

Yeah, all right, sure. 

Go ahead. 

That might be a good idea. 

Should have taken care of that son of a ___ right away. Sold out the old man. I don't want to see him again. Make that first thing on your list, understand? Speaker 7: Understood. Mike, tomorrow you get a couple of guys and go around to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show up. Speaker 7: Maybe we shouldn't get Mike to mixed up in this directly. Yeah. Listen. Hang around the house on the phone and be a big help. Try Luca again. Go ahead. What the hell is this? Speaker 8: That's just to send you a message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. Great story about Luca Brasi. 

What? You told me as you were watching this you haven't seen it that much. One of the classic American films. 

Yeah, I was very proud to be in it. Although when I first saw it, you know like all the actors are morons. They are children. I was all so I wanted to kill Fran. "How did you cut that out and why did you cut this out? I refuse to go to the party. You've cut me out." It's all about me. What about me? I remember, I'll tell you how clever Francis was. This is a great story I remember. A good friend of my who is here with me, my friend Andrew, and we were friendly with Lenny Montana. Lenny Montana was not an actor. He was a wrestler at one time. He was the Masked Marvel. The guy who played Luca Brasi was very famous. This guy, he was huge. He was the strongest man I've ever met in my life. He weighed about 350 pounds. His hands were like shoe boxes. There's this one scene where he comes in at the wedding and he says, "Don Corleone, I am honored to be here on the day of your daughter's wedding. May your first child be a masculine one." He keep doing it and Francis kept saying, "It's so stiff. Let's try to get him loose. Try to get him loose. Jimmy, you know, do something with him." Lenny, because I knew him as a friend, I abuse him a little bit. I said, "Come here. Listen. Do me a favor." I took a piece of tape and I put it on his tongue and he was crying, "Jimmy, don't make me do this. Don't make me do this." "Don't be stupid. Don't worry everybody will laugh. Just when you open the door," the camera is on the other side of the door. I put F-you on his tongue, right. When he says, "Don Corleone," you would read on the tape, F-you. He was crying. I said, "Trust me Lenny. Do this." I figured he'd laugh and loosen him up. He nearly cried. Finally I convinced him to do it. The door opened and there's Brando on the other side of the camera and he goes, "Luca Brasi, my most treasured friend," or whatever. He goes, "Don Corleone." Everybody laughed. Everybody laughed. Then we did it again and Brando when he did it again he put it on his tongue, F-you too. He said, "Luca." He never, never could get it together, get loose. And Fran, I think this is brilliant, we shot two or three weeks later we shot the scene that preceded that scene which was the wedding scene outside in Staten Island. Francis had this great idea. If you remember in the film he has Luca Brasi in the corner studying a speech. That was never written. That was a piece of brilliant work where he was saying, "Don Corleone, I am honored to -- " So then it worked so when he came in it was like this speech that he had memorized. I thought that was, but I probably liked the story a lot better than anybody else. 

No, we like the story. Brian's Song came out at the same time, the same year? 

Right. 

It was a huge success. 

Right. 

You couldn't have been bigger after those two movies, right? I mean it was huge for you. 

Yeah, that was a very fortunate year. 

Oh come on. 

No, it was. The truth is -- 

Come on, you walked around saying -- 

You're measured by, your success by the commerciality of the films. I wasn't any worse a year earlier. 

You were no worse and actor, you wouldn't have been as good. 

No. 

Let's just click off the things. Here you are, huge success in two. One film and Emmy Award Winning much watched on television and the other The Godfather. You turn down in succeeding years Apocalypse Now. You didn't want to do it. 

No. 

They wanted you to play who's part? 

The part that Charlie, I mean that Martin Sheen played. 

Drove him to a heart attack. 

Poor guy. Francis at the time, my first wife was pregnant, my second wife was pregnant, and Francis he came to me and said, "You can play any part you want." Okay, I picked that Colonel (inaudible) the guy that Bobby eventually played. He was playing poker with me, see. He thought I'd pick out like the big part. He said, "Come on Jimmy. It's 16 weeks." I said, "Fran, this is me, who are you talking 16 weeks" He says, "No, we'll live in Manila." 

In the Philippines. 

"Yeah, we'll live in Manila and fly to it." I said, "That's two thing I hate. Height and tsetse flies. So forget it. My kid is not going to be born in Manila." I unfortunately or fortunately, whatever, turned that town. 

Kramer versus Kramer? 

Right. 

Turned it down. 

"Middle-class, bourgeois, horse ___," I said. 

One Flew Over the CucKoo's Nest. Turned it down. 

Yeah. See I was going to go into a business at one time. 

You could have had a brilliant career. 

It was great. I was going to quit this stupid stuff that I do which is a silly thing for a grown man to do anyway and I was going to hire myself out to studio executives. This was all I would do. If they gave me a script and I said, "This stinks. Sink every dollar you got into it. Put everything you got into it. If I like it, blow it off." I was seriously thinking of that and people were going to pay a lot of money for that advice. 

Did you have good advice? Did somebody come along and say, "Jimmy, this is going to be great." 

Yeah, people try but they don't listen. This is all about me. 

How bad did it get between what happened to you after The Godfather and turning down those films and the comeback, the big comeback with Misery. 

That was quite a few years after that. I rode a pretty nice crest for a while. I did a bunch of films after that. I did Gambler, Thief, and (inaudible), excuse me and Funny Lady and a lot of things that I like and I was proud of. 

Things that you like. 

Then, it was a personal tragedy. I lost my sister at a point. 

She had leukemia didn't she? 

She had leukemia. She was like my best friend and I got involved in the god damn drug scene which for me was like absurd because where I came from, if I had one beer I'd be gone. I never saw that stuff. At the time that was running around. When I lost my sister I just realized that you've got to have passion for something. I really didn't have any for that. My three least favorite words are I don't care. It's like if someone says, "You want to play tonight?" "I don't care." Well if you don't care, don't play. 

Don't do it. 

You know, you want to make love? I don't care. You don't care! 

Don't do it. 

The hell with you, you know. I just quit. I thought I had plenty of money. I don't really regret it. I mean there are some things I do regret obviously but I had a great time. I coached kids for about 5-1/2 to 6 years. My son Scott, my oldest son Scott, who is 19 now I coached. 

And an actor. 

Yeah, a great actor, young. Very proud dad. My five year old, Alex, I think is going to be one too. And I have a seven month old too. My daughter is 30 and she's, thank god, not in the business. 

You threw it away. You were making a lot of bad decisions you were sort of -- 

I didn't so much throw it away as I coached these kids and I had a great time. I coached. 

So the time you weren't acting you were getting another kind of psychic income. 

Oh, it was great. I was coaching kids 10 months a year. I went from AYSO, that's soccer, to little league, to basketball. People thought, oh your creative needs. I said, "Listen, I didn't have to wait. I can work with one kid and change his whole life in five minutes." I didn't have to wait for like six months for them to put music and edit it and whatever. It happened right there. I had a great time. Now coming back, one day I looked and my dog's bones were showing and I was hungry and you know, somebody left with all my money. 

You said it's time (crosstalk). 

I got pretty much robbed and that was a tough time. That was a tough time. 

Not having the money. 

Well, coming back, you know. I always say that old adage, "Absence makes the heart grow fonder." That's not true. It makes them think you're dead. I had to overcome. 

The head thing. 

Not me so much as the perception that was there. I never really hung out. There were a lot of stories. If half of them were true I would have had a ball, but some of them were close enough. 

Close. 

I had to overcome that. As a matter of fact Francis was the first to come to my -- 

Garden of Stone. 

Gardens of Stone, right. Again, there was a horrible tragedy on that were Francis lost his son. I'd knew him since he was three as well. I mean what's making a movie? (inaudible) cancer what is it? It's silly? Then Castle Rock, Rob Reiner, and (inaudible) and all those guys came to me with Misery. Then Honeymoon in Vegas. 

Where are you now, the new film is Eraser, in terms of how you see the work you do and how you see the career and how you see? Are you having a good time? Do you feel a sense that -- 

I'm having a lot better time, Charlie, then I used to. There's a big difference between wanting to work and having to work. I think I finally looked at my birth certificate and said, "Hey, stop all these non-Jewish activities." Nine shoulder operations, rodeoing, racing boats. Hopefully I obviously did Eraser because I'm not really much in favor of these huge pictures. I mean pictures that are big just to be big. If you strip them of their special effects and their explosions and the stunts there's nothing but fluff left. There's not much need for guys like Duvall or Al or Dustin and guys like that. In this case, the story, there was a very good story. Had you taken all that stuff away you still had a pretty good story and it was very well written and good characters. I was lucky enough, and obviously there's a commercial value when you do an Arnold Schwarzenegger picture. 

You do because it makes a lot of money and therefore they come to you and say -- 

Therefore I'm a brilliant person again. 

You helped make the film. 

Of course, it's all my fault. 

It was Caan. He made Arnold good. 

Caanenegger. 

Caanenegger. You put on the back of the sweatshirt, t-shirt. 

Things are going really well. 

It's great to have you here. We have a clip from this film. Arnold Schwarzenegger and you too. You were his mentor. It's about the Witness Protection Program and Vanessa Williams is in. 

Beautiful Vanessa. 

Beautiful Vanessa Williams and -- 

He gets the girl, too. 

He gets the girl. 

He insisted. He cried like a baby. We had to change the ending. All right. 

Roll tape. Here's a clip. 

And so with a little slide of hand, one very dead John Doe trades places with one very live scumbag. 

Robert, sit down. 

John, you know, if God was as forgiving as WIT SEC hell would be one empty joint, no? 

God doesn't have our court system. 

So, uh, I understand you had a busy night. 

A couple of witnesses that kill us. 

I see. Did that include breaking into the county morgue? 

Someone once taught me that improvisation is the heart of field work, and it was you. 

Those were the old days. 

Is that what (inaudible) mean because of the morgue? 

Oh, no, no, man, The old man doesn't know anything about that and personally I don't think he has to. Shadow ops still has some privileges. 

You're right. 

Oh, John, it's good work. 

I had a good teacher. 

You had the best. 

Eraser, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Vanessa Williams, and Jimmy Caan. You also had two other films coming out in 1996. One is -- 

I did after this. I did a comedy with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler. I did a little thing in there. That will be out in September. I did a picture two years ago which has yet to be released. It will be released or it will escape, one of the two. 

It's great to have you here. It really is. You're a pleasure to talk to and I had a lot of fun. 

Thank you. It's very nice to be here.
