Good evening. I'm Robert Costa, filling in for Charlie Rose. David Brooks is here. He has been an op-ed columnist for "The New York Times" since 2003. His writing spans the worlds of politics, culture, and the social sciences. His books include "Bobos in Paradise," "On Paradise Drive," and the "Social Animal." I am pleased to have David Brooks join me today. Welcome, David. 

It's good to be with you, and with you and wishing Charlie best healing. 

Exactly. Where are we in this moment in President Trump's first hundred days or so in office? 

Yeah, I think we're a bit at a pivot. And the one thing I give Trump credit for is understanding what debate we're having in this country. You and I grew up in a world where it was big government versus small government, the market versus the state, and that debate is over. Now the debate is open versus closed. Those who have the tailwinds of globalization blowing at their back to a greater opportunity, and those who had the headwinds pushing in their faces and they want closed trade, closed borders. And we see that in this country. The Dutch are about to have an election. The French are about to have an election. And it's the same set of issues in all these places. And so we're at a moment when we've got a new political debate, and that creates not necessarily new alignments, but the parties take new positions, and sometimes swap positions. And we're sort of in the middle of that, I think. 

Where are we, though, in this realignment? Because when we see the health-care debate, Speaker Ryan is taking the lead. He says he's working in coordination with President Trump, and in many ways it's a mainstream Republican health-care plan. It doesn't have the flashes of populism that we may have imagined. Is Trump moving towards the mainstream GOP, the orthodoxy he has rejected? 

Yeah, I think he's a transitional figure. And my colleague, Ross Douthat and my friend, Ray Hunselon have written this. He's more like Jimmy Carter in that you had a certain democratic party, and then you had a democratic president with a Democratic House and Democratic Senate. You would think a lot would get done, but they weren't quite the old George McGovern democrats, but they weren't quite the new Bill Clinton democrats. They were just in the middle there. And as a result, there was a lot of incoherence. And so I think Trump is a sign of that incoherence, and so he's -- if you take the two power centers here in Washington right now, who I would say are Paul Ryan and Steve Bannon. Paul Ryan is pretty much -- he grew up through Empower America, which was a republican organization here in town, and it's pretty much the Reagan republican worldview, less government, more freedom. Steve Bannon represents a nationalist worldview, the working class people, the heart of our society are being hurt, let's give them some security. And so one wants to reduce government to enhance freedom and embrace risk, and the populists want to tighten down to increase security. And what's odd to me about this health-care plan, which is really much more Ryan than Bannon, is that it introduces more risk to people's lives, and it takes away social support. And so as we sit here, we don't know how many people are going to be denied insurance, but it's going to be millions, maybe eight, ten, 15 million. And so that's the Trump base. And what's odd to me about this health-care plan is it's declaring war on the people who voted for the Republican President by denying them security of these insurance plans, by taking subsidies that would go to them and using it for tax cuts for the rich, and then increasing risk in their lives. And I happen to be a guy who likes the idea of tax credits so people can buy insurance. But there's no question it increases risk. It puts the onus on us as individuals, and as family members, to make those choices and shop in that marketplace and bear those deductibles. And so I just don't think the Bannon wing of the party wants risks, wants to be deprived of the resources, and wants to live in a more uncertain world. And so, to me, we're sort of -- the health care reveals a party that is neither here hither nor yon. 

So if Bannon is really the soul of the Trump Presidency in terms of his populism and nationalism, why is it Speaker Ryan who is driving the process? 

Yeah, we were talking before, I want to write a column called "Let Bannon be Bannon." Like let him run the show. At least it would be coherent. I don't agree with the guy. I find him a little obnoxious maybe, but he has a coherent worldview, and he knows who his people are, and he's going to defend them. The Ryan/Bannon mixture is an incoherent mixture, and that's why this bill is disliked on all wings of the party, because it's neither hither nor there. And so the reason I think the Ryan and the congressional plan is taking over, A, they've been at this a lot longer. They've been coming up with various plans for years now. And, B, and more importantly, there's just no functioning White House apparatus. The administration has not even -- they've not even nominated people for the whole host of jobs. You just can't do -- the White House is the principals, these four or five people actually make decisions, and then all these scads of deputies, and those deputies are just not there throughout the administration, so you go to the State Department, the Treasury, and the Defense Department, and the secretaries, secretary, the big bosses, they're probably making the coffee, sweeping the floor, because there's no one else sticking around. And so you can't run a White House with four people. You just can't get anything done. 

And you wrote recently about how this health-care proposal could cause some disruption, and you look at the Medicaid aspect of the plan, and it phases out the Medicaid expansion by 2020. Some conservatives even want to move that date up. 

Right. 

Trump is someone who said early on he wants to provide coverage for everybody. He doesn't want to have this kind of disruption. But dealing with the Republican congress, it seems to be moving in that direction. What's the political consequence for this new President? I think for the whole party it's going to be onerous. The basic logic is this, the Republicans want to cut taxes, and there's things called the "net investment tax cut," which would only apply to people making over $250,000. It's the top one percent sort of deal. They want to get rid of that. But the more you cut those taxes, the more you got to reduce benefits, because you have to be budget neutral, at least in theory. And so you're got this basic pendulum. And so the tax cuts are bringing down -- going to bring down benefits, whether it's Medicaid or the size of the tax credit, for people on those working and middle income voters. And to me, the thing to do is to embrace a tax credit approach, a market-based approach, but do it at sufficient levels so that it actually provides support, increased support for everybody, which was what the Trump goals were. We'll keep people protected. We understand that capitalism is not basically working for people, but we're going to do it through market mechanisms. That seems to be where the future of the Republican Party is going. A different method of delivery but to provide some benefits for people. But the current republicans, whether it's Rand Paul or Ted Cruz, the main problem still in their mind is too much government, too much government. And I would just ask them, where have you been for the last 18 months? Did you not watch this election? I mean, you keep writing about how the Republican Party has to meet this moment. But it seems like whenever I'm at the Capitol and talking to members of the house and the senate, they almost feel pulled by this tide. They've been running against this health-care law ever since it was enacted, and they just feel compelled for base reasons, from pressure from the right, to just repeal and replace and to not really think through the full moment politically. 

Yeah. Well, there's a saying that intellectual progress rides in a hearse; meaning that people change their mind they just die off, and somebody new has to come along. And I think there's some element of that; that the republican orthodoxy has been so baked in that people go along with what they've been saying all along. It's just what they come it. It's hard to change your mind midlife. But I do think you got to look back and say, hey, what just happened to American politics? And, you know, my basic rule about Trump is he's the wrong answer to the right question. And the right question is that capitalism isn't working for people, and our social fabric has decayed to a degree that we're unfamiliar with, at least at the bottom income levels of society. And we can't just leave people on their own anymore. There's a guy in town who I'm sure we both know named Grover Norquist who used to be an advocate for something called the "Leave us Alone Coalition." 

That's right. 

All conservatives disagreed on a lot of things, but they all believe government should just leave us alone. Well that's not working anymore, because the social fabric is too frayed. Too many people lack the skills to get jobs. Too many people are dropping out of the labor force. Too many families are broken up. Opiate addiction is too rampant. You can't just leave people alone anymore, so republicans have to adjust and say I've got my method to help people along, and it's not going to be what the democrats want. It's not going to look like the great society, but it will help people to solidify the social fabric and to give people access to the new job market. 

So do you think republicans and President Trump may have made a mistake by beginning with health care, then looking to tax reform and perhaps not -- they didn't start with infrastructure. They didn't start with some of the more populist sides of his campaign. 

Right, that's my let down on -- I would've started with infrastructure, because, A, you can get a chance at bipartisan support and that's so important early in an administration. And, B, have you looked around at American political history for the last 20 years? Clinton, Obama, pretty much every administration who has taken up health care, it's ended up biting them in the rear. And so one of the things, you know, for those of us who have covered administration after administration, their first selection of policy is always a product of hubris. George W. Bush decided the first thing I'm going to do my second term is social security privatization reform. And that was a big mistake, because it muddied the water for any kind of bipartisanship, and it introduced more risk into people's lives, which they did not want. And I would say, frankly, the same thing of Obama. He did the stimulus package first, necessitated by events. But if Obama had said, well what political moment are we in? What I really worry about is inequality, and so every program I'm going to focus on is going to go after those working class voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Wisconsin. If he had done that, democrats wouldn't have lost the House, they wouldn't have lost the Senate, they wouldn't have lost the White House. But, instead, he did health care, which was a legitimate problem. But given our political moment, it was a secondary problem not a primary problem. 

You wrote recently that President Trump's address to Congress was Trumpism at its best. If that was Trumpism at its best, what's been Trumpism at its worst in terms of perhaps the President's behavior, his allegations about some kind of surveillance of Trump Tower? What's the worst, if that's the best? 

At least -- there are so many worsts. There's a succession of worst. But the worst I'm disturbed by at the moment -- and Trump's character is him at his worst. The thing I liked about the speech was his character was sort of off to the side and it was just the subject and the policy areas. But the thing that I think I worry about the most this week -- I'll have a new worst next -- is the de-legitimization of our institutions. And so we live in Washington. I live inside the beltway, and so maybe that's suspect. But I spend a lot of time with people who work in the federal agencies. I went to the congressional budget office recently, a year or two ago, and was there and met all the economists. And they work really hard. And at the Bureau Labor of Statistics, they work really hard. Our intelligence agencies, they work really hard. Most of them are not big political thinkers. They just believe in what they're doing. They're trying to serve the country. They just want some clear direction. Let them do their jobs. They're not super ideological partisans. And what I think Trump is doing is he's delegitimizing the job numbers that come out of the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. The studies that come out of the CBO which are excellent, by the way, sometimes wrong, but we all get things wrong, and then all the basic institutions of our government. And if people lose faith in that, I don't care what your agenda is, we can't get anything done. We have to have some basic faith in our institutions. And I think one of the reasons the country is pretty great is that we have a basically, functioning government, basically non-corrupt compared to everywhere else around the world. Basically accurate in its good faith service to what the jobs are. 

The legitimacy point is so important, because if you looked at most of the republicans who ran in the primary last time, they wanted to take an ax to the federal government and cut a lot of these agencies. But it's the way Trump and his associates talk about them that's delegitimizing; we keep hearing this term come out of the White House the "deep state." 

Yeah. 

And it's a way of framing the intelligence community in an almost conspiratorial tone. 

Yeah. It's paranoia. And it is a sort of intellectual pollution. You know, republicans have always wanted to cut the size of government. Fine. But if you ask people in previous republican administrations, Reagan, the Bushes, even very conservative people, what do you think of the career people you worked with, the career bureaucrats or the civil servants? Everyone will say they were surprisingly good. And that's always been my experience when I go in and sit in on a meeting off the record in one of the agencies. I'm always saying these people are pretty impressive, and they're not making a lot of money. They do it maybe because they like some job security, but they also believe in the mission of their agency and they believe in the country. And so you can have more of them or less of them, but to say they're rigged, to say that the jobs numbers are rigged, to say that President Obama meant Obama Care to fall apart in 2017, to say that the CAIB intelligence agencies are malevolently out to get somebody is just inaccurate, and it's a form of corrosive cynicism that just tears at the social fabric. 

You've written about how President Trump has gone after some of these core tenets of the Republican Party, including the hawkish consensus on foreign policy. How has the President revealed himself, if in any way so far, on foreign policy? 

Yeah, I mean I would say he's threatening the liberal world order. I mean this has been an article of faith in the party, and in both parties, really, that the main threat is either communism or fascism or authoritarianism, people who don't play by the rules. And what we have to do is create a set of world order which is based on NATO and the EU and our Asian alliances and the WTO. And they sound technocratic and unspiritual. But it's a set of world order and we're all going to play by the rules. And by the way, we're not going to pick and choose what rules we play by. We're going to cooperate and all play by the rules. And some of those rules are, you don't invade your neighbors. And, you know, so that order has sort of held us together. And I think that order has been one of the great historical achievements mostly, and it was led by the U.S. And what Trump embodies is a different mentality. The people who created this world order, the big institutions, George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, those guys, they thought it was not us versus the world, it was us amplifying our power by cooperating with the world. And those things like NATO, they were expansions of American power. Trump has a much more zero-sum worldview. If they're doing well, we're doing badly, and therefore, we've got to do well and make them do badly. And he made that speech at the joint session speech, "I'm not President of the world, I'm President of the United States." That would never have occurred to Dwight Eisenhower, because that distinction does not exist. And so what I think he's ending up doing is, first, he's weakening American power, because he's getting us out of these institutions which would enhance it, and he's letting more room for the wolves of the world, like the Vladimir Putins, to do their mischief. 

But how deeply invested is President Trump in this worldview? Is this coming from Steve Bannon, or is this something you think the President himself is committed to? 

I don't know for sure, but I have heard people in the real estate business, in his sort of real estate business, say every deal is zero sum; that if you're buying a property or something, if one side of the deal does well, the other side is going to do badly. It's not like a lot of realms of business where we cut a deal and we both do well. And so that sort of zero-sum worldview I do think pervades his thinking. 

Where does the relationship with Russia and Putin stand in your view? 

Yeah, well, to me, the crucial fact is what does Russia have on him? Why are we talking about Russia so much? I mean, Russia is a significant country, but it hasn't dominated American foreign policy for the last 15 years. But suddenly everything is Russia, Russia, Russia. And, you know, so this aid has Russia ties, that aid, that aid. And they're mysteries, like Paul Manafort was a guy, a former figure in the Republican Party with strong Russia ties. Suddenly out of the blue he becomes chief of staff of the Trump campaign. 

Campaign chairman. 

How did that happen? 

And they changed the platform to make it more pro-Russia. 

So why is Russia so dominant in Trump world? I want to know why that happened. 

Everyone does. 

Yeah. And it could be -- you know, it could be because at a time when he was post-bankruptcy, he couldn't find anybody to invest, and there were a lot of Russian investors, or at least Russian buyers. But we just don't know what that is because of the tax returns, because they're not public. And it's hard to know what our foreign policy toward Russia is until we know the source of the obsession with Russia within Trump world. 

Who are the moral arbiters within the Republican Party right now? If the President, in your view, is delegitimizing institutions and changing world order, who are the voices to counter it? Because one column that so sticks out with me is your column about the Faustian Bargain that so many republicans have made; that they'll get health care and they'll get taxes as long as they just kind of go along with the rest of the Trump plan. 

Yeah. I'm not sure they're going to get any of that either. But, you know, they go along because they see opportunities for their agenda, which is fine. They go along because Trump has 85 percent approval among republican voters, which is fine. The problem is there's so much baggage comes along, and so much in terms of character, in terms of foreign policy. And so what I'm beginning to see on Capitol Hill, particularly in the Senate, is a bunch of republicans who, I think, are behaving pretty well. You know, if they were like me, you know, they'd be all anti-Trump and they'd be hammering. But they're not going to be like me. I'm probably to their left on a lot of issues, and I don't have to have republican voters vote for me to keep my job. But I would say they're trying to improve Trump. They're trying to respect him. They're trying to move him. They're being brave enough to criticize him. 

Who? 

Some people who -- the expected ones like Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Susan Collins. Some who are expected and who are really outstanding human beings who do it out of conscience and because they're good senators and citizens, Rob Portman of Ohio, but even some I tend to disagree with more. Ted Cruz, I think, is behaving in a role that I find responsible. He's not just a showman anymore. He's trying to move things substantively. I think Marco Rubio is doing a very good job. He's been tough on Russia but trying to be helpful and cooperative. And this has been something we see all the time in American politics, and this goes back to the Iraq War. There are some people who are critical in order to get on the Sunday shows. But there are some people that are critical in order to be helpful. And that spirit of helpfulness is something that I'm beginning to see in a lot of Republican Senators. And it's one of the nicer things, to see all these people emerge from the shadows. 

What about Ryan, Speaker Ryan and leader McConnell? 

Yeah, I think they're in a tougher position. You know, I guess I wish Paul Ryan had said we've got a party that has got a lot of different factions and, like it or not, I just got to pick one. Now they did tax credits in the health-care bill. But it seems to me he has not settled upon a top-to-bottom philosophy of where we are as a country and what we need in the way that Steve Bannon does have a top-to-bottom philosophy. And so I just wish -- Paul Ryan's from a working class area in Wisconsin, and so I would like him to say, okay, there's a new situation facing my people in Janesville, or wherever he's from. And the government has to be a little different than it was when I was working in Washington in the 1980s, and I'm not sure he's gotten there yet. He's a very respectable, very good guy. I just think intellectually one doesn't see the sort of coherence one sees in a lot of other people. 

You've been traveling a lot more since the election. And when you are out there in different states, different towns and cities giving talks or teaching, how are working-class Americans of both parties reacting to this first two, three months of the Trump Presidency? Is this something they want to see succeed? Are they alarmed in any way? 

Yeah. I've become a little hesitant to speak on behalf of working class -- 

I know, but just you're anecdotal observation. 

I guess one of the things I would say is I see a lot of people who want him to succeed, and even a lot of people who didn't vote for him. They don't want to give up on this presidency. And so they would like to see some success. And I see also a lot of realism. You know, how many times have we heard somebody in the coffee shop -- or I go to a bar. I call it reporting, others call it drinking -- and say, You know, I wish that guy would put away his tweeter, or, you know, whatever, his phone. And so they're realistic. People are very good at disaggregating the nonsense, the circus part of Trump from what they hope for him. And so I would say I see not many people who were pro-Trump who have given up on him, and not a lot of hostility. I see a lot of realism that we knew we were kind of getting this package, and we're still getting it. I'm looking to see how it shakes out. But the people who were pro-Trump are still pro-Trump for sure. 

And the President, later this week, is going to be going to Nashville, and he's going to be paying some kind of tribute there to Andrew Jackson. And I think this comes back to that Bannon influence. 

Right. 

What do you make of this continued association the White House is making with Andrew Jackson? 

Yeah, I mean it is -- to me it's a bit of a -- I guess Donald Trump is no Jackson to me. And Jackson wasn't the greatest thing either. But what Trump's nationalism strikes me as is much closer to the nationalism we're seeing around the world, the nationalism we're seeing in Holland or the nationalism we're seeing in Austria or in the UK, the UK party. And that's not a typical American nationalism. The Trump nationalism is the good folk, the simple folk of this country have the purity and the virtue and the wisdom, and it's very backward looking. It's very historicist; that it existed in the past. It was in the peasants, as they would say in Russia, and that it's being corrupted by outside forces; immigrants, globalists, Davos people. And that's just not the way Americans have defined their nationalism. 

Because you've written for years about how you'd like to see the politics of this country move more toward national greatness and the idea of American greatness. 

Yeah. 

But you're saying there's a real difference between kind of John McCain style republican of a few years ago American greatness and what Trump's articulating. 

Yeah, and the first thing to say is I really defend nationalism. A lot of people are against nationalism. But that's like being against religion. Religion can be used in good ways or it can be used for bad political ways. Now if we don't have nationalism, if we turn into a bun of Brussels people or Davos people, you get this deracinated, disenchanted, amoral style of politics. You've got to have a unifying national idea. But the American idea was not based on looking to the past. It was based on a forward unitive dream of the future. The religious term is eschatology, the belief in the end of times, and whether it was Alexander Hamilton or the founders or Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan, the definition of America is what we're shooting toward, toward the future, and we saw the President from the vantage point of the future. And when the people were crossing Tennessee, one of the things the foreigners noticed, the observers noticed, they'd come to a valley, which had great farmland, but they'd keep going west because they assumed there would be something even better on the other side of the next valley. And that was the American spirit; that it was future looking, not backwards. So we weren't so much tied to the past. And that created a culture in which we moved more, we started companies more, we created industries more, because it was always dynamic moving forward. And what's been interesting to me, at the same time you have this backward looking nationalism of Bannon, maybe Trump, we've also become a culture of where we move less. Entrepreneurial rates are down. And so we've become less dynamic. I think we've become less American. And I support nationalism that rekindles that sense of we've got to be on the move. 

How are the democrats responding to all these swirling forces and to Trump? 

Well they're a little off to the side right now, because the fight is within the Republican Party, say, on health care. I think they have not yet found their voice either. The people farthest along are the progressives that have a coherent worldview. And what you don't have on the left, which I think I'm waiting for, is a group of people who are going to say, okay, this guy, Donald Trump, is for closed, closed trade, closed borders, no ethnic diversity. So we're going to be for open. We're unabashedly going to be for open. We're going to be for ethnic diversity. We're going to be for open social mores. We're going to be for open trade, relatively open immigration. We're going to embrace global capitalism, and because we believe in its dynamism, and we're going to make it work. We're going to make it work for everybody. You haven't seen that. You haven't seen a modernization of the Clinton paradigm, which would be pro open, pro globalization, but in a functioning way. And I'm waiting for that person to emerge. Hillary Clinton could have been that person if she'd said, no, I'm for TPP, I'm for trade. I've been for trade all my life. I believe we need the dynamism, but we're just going to make the rules a little different. But she couldn't quite get herself there because it would have caused this fracture on her left. 

No one in either party seems to want to make that kind of pitch. I was reading through "Bobos in Paradise" the other day, and I was wondering to myself, what happened to this country that David wrote about? Not too long ago, it was so about the ascended America, embracing technology, embracing globalization, and now, if you even talk in those terms politically, democrat or republican, you're seen as somewhat -- you're the past. 

Yeah. I mean, parts of "Bobos in Paradise" are still there, Whole Foods and Restoration Hardware, they still exist. But the spirit is totally different. The post-World War spirit -- I wrote that book in the '90s, 2000. Silicon Valley was booming, and we had just won the Cold War. Capitalism looked like it was on the march. The American model looked like it was on the march. Well, and I guess what I would say has happened is that the 21st century happened, and the 21th century started on 9/11, and it's been marked by 16 or 17 straight years where the number of democracies in the world has gone down. The number of authoritarian governments has gone up. The level of ethnic separatism and ethnic nationalism has risen, and you've got people trying to build walls, trying to build walls around this country, trying to build walls in Europe. You've got religious fanaticism in the Middle East. You've got terrorism throughout the world. And so it's been an ugly start to the century. And as a result, the spirit of hope and the spirit of optimism and the spirit that history marches toward progress has been lost, and everybody thinks things are going in a bad direction, and everybody's in a bad mood. 

Let's talk about ethnic nationalism for a minute, because a lot of republicans I talk to in my reporting, they don't ever really want to broach that topic. But then you see congressmen like Steve King of Iowa, had a tweet over the weekend, where he alluded, in a sense, to ethnic nationalism, and even white nationalism. And it's there, it's out in the open on the republican side. Maybe on the democratic side too. But what are we to make of all this, this flurry of ethnic nationalism within the Trump movement? 

Yeah I think it's -- you know, I don't know how much of it is in there, it's there clearly. And I would, again, differentiate between racism and nationalism. You can be proudly pro-American and not be a racist. But there clearly is a lot of racism. And there's clearly a lot of fear, which drives just fear of the other, and a sense of contamination. You know, the Dutch are going to have these elections I keep mentioning. And there you've got a party and candidate who is explicitly -- more explicitly than Americans actually, saying, we've got to have more people like us and fewer like them, meaning fewer Muslims. And that's just we've got to preserve our ethnic purity, our cultural purity. And America has never really believed in that, because we've always been a pretty ethnically and culturally diverse nation. But you're beginning to see this European style of ethnic nationalism exist here as people want to preserve -- want a country that looks like themselves. Or at least white people do. And on the one hand I sort of get it. It's revolutionary that we've gone from a country where large swaths of it were largely white to a country where the -- especially among the young, it's minority/majority. Minority, majority, minority, whatever. And so I get the fact that this is a radical social experiment. But what I don't get is the intense sense of pessimism about this experiment, because as we become a more diverse country I think we become a safer country. Crime rates have plummeted. We've become a more interesting culture. We've become a more tolerant culture. And so what interests me about the Trump worldview is how fear-driven it is. How the assumption is that crime rates are soaring, when, in fact, crime rates are falling. The assumption that opportunity is plummeting and everyone is getting screwed, when the fact is a lot of good things happening in this country. And so it's fear and enforcement. And so what strikes me about the term "world view" is it's, A, fear based; and, B, the remedy is always intimidation. It's never compassion. And so it's just this dark angry view of the world, which then manifests itself in an ethnic nationalist role. 

So, David, finally, as we all navigate this new environment, you wrote recently that thinking about politics in the age of Trump means relying less on the knowledge of political science and more on the probings of D. H. Lawrence, David Foster Wallace, and Carl Jung. Explain what that means. 

Yeah, I'm about to get extremely Charlie Rose on us. So I do think things have deteriorated in some ways, and mostly the social fabric has deteriorated. There's a guy, Rusty Reno, who has a phrase, the crisis of solidarity. And to me, that's what we're suffering from. We're just less close to one another across class, within our communities. Our social capital is down, and so we're more isolated in fundamental ways. And, to me, that happened for philosophical reasons. We made mistakes. And here's where the Charlie Rose moment comes, and that's because we chose the wrong philosophers. We chose John Stuart Mill when we should have chosen Martin Buber. What I mean by that is Mill sees us as a series of individuals, a very individualistic worldview. Martin Buber wrote a book called "I and Thou." He sees us as a bunch of relationships. And so we became too individualistic when we should be a little more communitarian. We also chose Jeremy Bentham instead of Viktor Frankl. Jeremy Bentham thought that we were motivated by pleasure and pain. Viktor Frankl thought we're motivated by a search for meaning, to want to lead good lives. And so in my view our society has become too economic, too social sciency, and too utilitarian, and not enough moralistic. And then finally, we chose Réne Descartes when we should have chosen St. Augustine. And Réne Descartes thought we should think with our heads, that we're primarily cognitive, rational creatures. Augustine thought we're primarily emotional, loving creatures, and so we've become too cognitive when we should be more emotional. And so basically we've turned into shells of ourselves and that's cut down on intimacy, and it's had these devastating social effects. But it's ideas that drive behavior, and I think we have some of the wrong ideas. 

David Brooks, thank you. 

Thank you. 

Good evening. I'm Stephanie Zahcarek filling in for Charlie Rose. "Personal Shopper" is a new film from writer/director Olivier Assayas. The film marks the second collaboration between Assayas and Kristen Stewart, following 2014's "Clouds of Sils Maria." Stewart became the first American actress to win a César award, France's equivalent of the Oscar, for her work in that film. In "Personal Shopper," she plays a woman determined to connect with her recently deceased twin brother from the afterlife. Here is a look at the trailer. 

What are you doing in Paris? (MUSIC) 

I'll take it. This too. 

...and $2,000 for each bag. 

Great. I'm a personal shopper. Kyra's very high profile. She can't do normal things, so I assist her. 

You have nothing better to do besides dress Kyra? (MUSIC) 

I'm waiting. 

What are you waiting for? (MUSIC) 

My twin brother, Louis, died here. It's been 95 days. We made this oath... whoever died first would send the other a sign. 

From the afterlife? (MUSIC) 

Has that always been there? (MUSIC) Louis, are you here? (MUSIC) I had a sign. 

Are you sure? (MUSIC) 

There was a presence. 

Do you think Louis is here? 

I don't know. (MUSIC) Kyra. I'm just going to drop these bags for you, okay? Hey. (MUSIC) Kyra was murdered. 

What were you doing at her place? 

Why are you asking? (MUSIC) I'm lost. I can't tell whether or not I'm going crazy. (MUSIC) I'm blessed to see you. Or is it just me? (MUSIC) 

I am pleased to Olivier Assayas and Kristen Stewart at this table for the first time. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

So, Olivier, this is the second film that you've made together. Can you tell us what made you want to work with Kristen Stewart in the first place, and what made you decide to want to work with her again? 

You know, I hardly knew Kristen when we made Clouds of Sils Maria. I just loved her work. I have always loved her work. But, you know, how much we would connect and how it would work between us was, you know, was a question mark for both of us. And I think the reason why I kept on working with her after "Clouds of Sils Maria" and hope to keep on working with her after "Personal Shopper," it's because I think that, you know, the way we connected on the set of "Clouds Sils Maria," what I saw her do, the nuances, I realized, you know, that she was certainly one of the great actresses I have been, you know, privileged to work with. And I think we complement each other. I think we're very different, but somehow we kind of -- I think that Kristen brings me a lot, and I try to give her as much as I can in return. 

So your character plays a woman who is grieving, and she's trying to accept the loss of her brother. In portraying the character, did you draw on any personal experiences or did you just use sort of that imagination, which is a great actor's tool? You know, how personal was it for you? 

You know, I've had tastes of, you know, relatively speaking, sort of like crippling anxiety that wasn't really rooted in anything other than just grand questions that, like, are a little stymieing. And I think, like, in retrospect, all of those times in my life were kick started by some sort of loss, definitely and significant compared to the loss of a twin brother. But I knew that feeling. Even feeling sick sometimes, if you have a really bad flu, like just anything that sort of reminds you of mortality and what there is in life to actually hold and grasp and know for certain, and that is actually very little. And so when you're reminded of that, it's kind of difficult to function in a normal kind of like flippant default setting, which is how we exist typically. I mean, that's the only way to get through life in any way, that's, you know, productive. And so I knew that feeling. But the depths in which that debilitating feeling affects her, I've never come close. But, like you say, I could sympathize. 

It seems to me, too, that this performance, this role, is almost like -- it must have been written as a circle that wasn't quite closed. And I think your performance really closes the circle. Can you talk a little bit about writing the role, and did you have -- 

Well, you know, it's pretty much the way I always write. I mean, to me, I write open screenplays, as opposed to locked screenplays. I think there's something just so boring to making movies if everything is like finalized at the screenwriting level. But, of course, it's scary, it's dangerous, and you have to do extra convincing when you try to sell that to your financiers. But I'm convinced that filmmaking happens on the set. I mean, you know, the screenplay is just like a trampoline, or it's something that you use it to project yourself into something that's much more complex, much more lively, and I think that in that sense filmmaking is like a magnet. You know, it attracts life. So a film should constantly be open, like the windows open, doors open, so everything -- you know, you can channel everything into the same energy that will create the film, which ultimately, you know, is pretty much about the screenplay, but the screenplay being more like a backbone, you know, and you gradually give flesh and blood to it. 

You've been working for a long time. Even though you're very young, you know, you started working as a child basically, and you've worked in a lot of different types of movies. Obviously the "Twilight" movies made you famous. Obviously this is a different way of working. How do you compare it to other types of movies that you've made, and at any point were you scared about things that Olivier was maybe asking you to do or looking for? 

Even on a larger film that requires more finality in terms of what the result is going to end up being, like more predetermination, I always try and forget those things and sort of, like, allow other people to worry about them, because it's funny, like what he was saying about keeping doors open and windows open, it's really the only way to do anything that doesn't just feel like an impression or an imitation of life. I don't want to imitate life. I really want to, like, interpret it and allow someone to capture it. And also about the windows and doors thing, it's totally what "Personal Shopper" is about, too. Like if you think you know everything in terms of, like, you know, the larger questions, then you're closing yourself off to so much that life can offer you. And then you really just live in the immediacy of, like, everyday practicality, which is, you know, to a certain extent, boring and empty. So, yeah, even on a big movie, there's a certain job that an actor has to tell a story and hit certain emotional marks. And to be honest with you, I don't do very well in that position. I don't thrive. I feel like, you know, even on a larger -- like on a movie like "Twilight," the moments that were written in the book or in the screenplay that everyone sort of, like, maybe were, like, deeply attached to, I always felt like I messed them up, and then the moments that were -- the moments that just happened to bubble up on-set that maybe wasn't such a huge moment in the script or in the book, those were the things -- the things that surprised me were the things that were always like, oh man, I think we just got to it, and I think that's actually servicing the story in a much better way than if I had cried at the right moment when he said the thing to me about the thing, you know, like, so, yeah, that's how I like to work as well. 

And, Olivier, many of your movies, not just this one, I'm thinking of "Boarding Gate" and "Demon Lover," you're very open to the fact that we rely on technology, we need technology, we live with technology, but you're also kind of wary of it and wary of its limitations. Can you talk a little bit about how that plays out. 

You know, it's -- when I was making, like, a while ago a movie like "Demon Lover," I think that technology, modern means of communication were not as much, you know, inscribed inside our culture. And at that point, maybe I had ideas about it. Now I have, like, zero idea about it. I just accept it as a fact, and there's no other way to do it. But the only thing is that because I'm pre-digital and digital at the same time, I have at least the perspective of time, and I can -- I'm aware in that sense how, ultimately, the way we communicate, the way we explore the internet or the way, you know, our Smartphones are hardwired in our brains have changed the human experience. They have changed the human identity. So it's not so much that I'm interested in gadgets. The thing is that I'm interested in is how they are transforming human beings. And it's really something that I realized when I was writing Personal Shopper. It's that I think that if you want to describe the modern character, you also have to deal with the way that human being does communicate or use social media, or not social media, or whatever, because those are end up being defining element in the psychology. Maybe we should use another word now, but it's like some there's kind of external psychology to individuals today through means of communication. But, you know, I don't think it's acknowledged how deep it goes. 

How would you approach the more mysterious element of the character that you're playing, this role, where you have the phone in your hand? You're obviously, you know, texting. You're very comfortable with it. But then at a certain point you start receiving these messages on the phone that appear to be from perhaps from your deceased brother or from a person playing a prank, or a malevolent spirit. So how did you approach that? 

I think that there is a concrete answer on who that person actually is that I'm texting, and I'm only aware of that as an actor, approaching the story as a screenplay that I've read, and so I know how everything plays out. But I think if I were to wipe that from my, you know, memory, the person or spirit or entity or whatever that she's speaking to is this ever-evolving thing, and I think that that speaks to, like, the definition of one's own reality. If you believe it, then it's true. And so I think that there are times where she's absolutely talking to herself. I think it's an internal dialogue. And then there are times when she, you know, assumes that it's, you know, another character within the movie, which is hard to describe, because, you know, I don't know if people have seen this while watching this interview, but I think it's weird because your phone gives you an ability to live quite presently all the time, but then at the same time, depending on how you use it, it does the opposite of that. So, yeah, playing with a phone as a costar was kind of cool, because at any moment, it's a shapeshifting costar, and so it's almost like I had -- there were multiple people that I was interacting with. And it's really self-reflective and, like, a little maddening. Just as texting people can be. You know, you can speak to someone and think that you're having one conversation, and the other person can be having an entirely different experience. And that's in life too. That's like we could, you know, obviously that could be happening between us right now verbally. But it's more so when you're not actually in front of someone. So it allows you to sort of tailspin. And, yeah, no, that's it. It was strange, but, like, really, the one thing I was worried about was it would not be very engaging cinematically, that it might be -- that I might be boring or something. But those scenes had the most -- for me, had absolutely the most tension. 

Yeah, all of those scenes work. Those scenes really work. And that's interesting to me to hear that you know who is doing the texting, because, you know, I've seen the movie. I love the movie. And I'm still talking to other people who have seen it who say, we don't think it's a person who is texting. We think it's a spirit. So you have the answer. Olivier, you came up with the idea. 

Well, you know, you're witness to a car crash, and you ask ten people who were there what happened, you will have ten versions. Actually, reality is only one version, because it's obvious. It's very easy to connect the dots. I think that human perception and the way you process film based on your own preconceptions in a certain way is very interesting, because I think that -- you know, I think it has to do with the fact that I never feel like I'm making movies for an audience. I'm making movies for individuals, for a lot of individuals, hopefully. But I know that every single person is going to absorb the film thinking in a different way, and I'm not trying to resist that. You know, a lot of filmmaking is about resisting that. It's really about establishing things clearly and, you know, just controlling your audience. I hate the notion of controlling my audience. You know, I think I'm trying to make a movie that's half -- that's certainly narrative, but also has some kind of poetic or dream-like dimension, and I want the film to be open to interpretation. I want the audience to daydream about the film. So whatever they're imagining is valid. It's totally valid, because that's how your relationship with any given work of art functions. You know, like when you're looking at a painting you can stay 30 seconds, five minutes, an hour in front of the same painting. Your gaze can, you know, travel in strange different ways inside the canvas. So ultimately everybody will have a completely different analysis of what's going on in that canvas. And movies, it has to be acknowledged, movies are very much like that. So, again, I have easy answers for everything in the film. I'm not sure that they're that interesting. You know, it's really like, when in "Clouds of Sils Maria," the character of Valentine that Kristen plays, she disappears at some point; right? And, you know, I had so many times the questions, so why is she disappearing and so on and so forth? She disappears because it's much more interesting if she disappears. She could also get on a bus and go away, you know, and it's a quick shot. It's done, it's finished. Like, you know, she has her suitcase and, you know, and the bus drives off, and why not. But if she just disappears, she remains a question mark and she echoes through all the ending of the film. So, yeah, that's more or less how I function. 

There's one moment in the film that I want to ask you about, and it happens late in the film. Your character, Maureen, has stayed overnight at a friend's house. And Maureen comes downstairs and she goes to the kitchen and there's an electric tea kettle on the counter, and I notice that Maureen just taps it with the side of her hand to see if it's hot before she pours the water. 

I love that. 

Well, you know, as a viewer, when I'm watching a performer and I notice something like that, my first thought is, does she know that she's doing it? So did you know that you -- or was it just automatic? How much is instinct and how much is craft? 

It's pretty much all instinct. At that point I knew that I -- I walked downstairs thinking that I'm alone in the house, and I see that there's a kettle before I see that there's somebody sitting outside, and so I think that the whole thing was like, yes, I would like some tea, but it's like, oh, this is so -- my thing was, she's always wondering, like, who's around and who's watching. 

Yeah. 

And, yeah, so I think that was just like how long has he been there? Has he been inside? You know what I mean? Like, yeah, that's all. But, so that, to be honest with you, to be deadly honest, I did think about that, but a lot of times I've had questions. Recently somebody asked me if I was -- like how I came to the choice of not unwrapping my silverware before using the napkin on my face in a movie that I did with Kelly Reichardt, and I was like, what? I didn't think about it. And, like, that was just a brilliant choice. You know, you just didn't have time in your life in that moment to unwrap, and it just says everything about your character, and it was my favorite part of the movie, and I was like, cool. I didn't think about it at all, yeah. 

But you know the thing is that we didn't even discuss this. But it's really interesting you would mention it, because it really struck me when Kristen did it, you know. I said, wow, you know, I thought it was just so good. I mean, it was so real. And it's not something you can tell an actor to do. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't come to your mind. And I think it's stuff like that that makes the film and the character alive and that Kristen constantly brings. 

So you two obviously have this kind of great chemistry and, you know, great way of communicating. Are you going to work together again do you think? 

Yeah, I'm writing a feature for him. 

Yes, yeah. (LAUGHTER) That's the next step. 

Yeah, he's going to be my star. 

Yeah, that's the next step. 

Oh. Okay. I like the sound of that. 

No, but hopefully I would do, like, yeah, I mean, I would -- not to, you know, put words in his mouth, but I don't think -- I don't think this is the end of it, but, like, you know. 

No. 

Thank you so much for being here Olivier, and thank you, Kristen. "Personal Shopper" opens in theaters Friday, March 10th. Thank you for joining us.
