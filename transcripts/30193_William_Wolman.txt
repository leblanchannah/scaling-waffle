Welcome to the broadcast. An interesting conversation tonight. We'll first talk about the economy of the United States. Are we in a recession? Is the recession over? What's the outlook? What's going to happen? Do we expect anything from the Republican Party, from the President, or from the Congress? Is there a tax cut in the offering? All of that with four distinguished observers of the economy. Also, we'll talk with Martin Amis, he is a British writer who you've heard something about. He's the son of Kingsley Amis. In addition, a report on AIDS. Dr. Mathilde Krim is here. Also, we'll talk with a group of people about the consequences of the Magic Johnson announcement and what else we can expect on the AIDS front. All that's coming up. But first we start talking about the economy. With me this evening are Jeff Madrick, NBC News correspondent; Tom Herman, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal; William Wolman, chief economist with BusinessWeek; and Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist with Bear Stearns & Co Inc. Welcome. It's good to have you. Listen, Wolman, let me start with you then. Tell me where you think the economy is? Is the President right? Is the Congress right? Who knows where we stand, and how good or bad is it? 

Well with demand for certainty greatly exceeds the supply, but my guess is - 

Certainty in terms of profit? 

No, in terms of forecast. Forecast, okay. But in my opinion, coming somewhere between zero, I'd say it's not growing at all this quarter, okay, and slightly negative. So we're flat and down a little bit. 

And why is that? 

Why is it that we're doing very badly? 

Yeah. 

Well I think the basic reason is that we're suffering the consequences of overly tight monetary policy and probably some of the excess of the '80s is now coming to wash over us. 

We wouldn't be here if we'd had a looser -- if they had been looser with the interest rates? 

We would not be here if the Fed had followed the correct monetary policy, that was correct for a long period of time. 

All right. You look at the evidence for your position. Auto sales are down. 

Right. 

Housing sales are down. Unemployment is on the rise. 

Right. 

What else? 

Well hours worked do not cover for the economy as a whole are less than the average of a third quarter, that usually is the case that we're sliding back into a recession. Real retail sales are weak. Almost anything you care to mention is very weak. It's relatively weak. And it maybe, and it's certainly been, that things are getting worse right now rather than better. There may be no recovery. There may be a double dip, Charlie. 

Larry? 

Well, as usual, Bill Wolman, who's a distinguished economist, has the story completely wrong. And at best he's the lagging indicator. My own view is all things are not right in the economy, but there is far too much pessimism out there. And what a lot of analysts and talking heads have ignored is a significant decline of interest rates and a significant decline of inflation, both of which provides substantial stimulus to the economy. And in particular I want to note -- 

But is any evidence of that stimulus now? (CROSS-TALKING) Help me out. 

Let me finish. It's a tough crowd late evening here, very difficult. Mortgage Bankers Association just released a report that showed that new loan applications for mortgages, that is to say home sales, are rising at a record rate in the last six or eight weeks. And refinancing applications are off the chart. Both of these are a function of declining interest rates, which are acting to stimulate the economy. My view is we've had a little soft spot here in September and August data, but we're going to see a significant rise in housing. Furthermore, the U.S. is a strong exporting power. Capital goods, manufacturing, and producing industries are going to outperform all expectations. 

(Indiscernible). 

Let him finish. 

My judgment is the economy next year, '92, is going to grow by at least 3%. Having said that, I want to add on last point. The worst performing sector of the economy is the lack of new business starts, which is where most of our nation's jobs come from. 

Capital gains coming? 

And I think we need some tax cuts to stimulate the economy. 

You got that right. So do I, I think we need new tax cuts. Certainly not capital gains tax cuts. 

Why not capital gains tax cuts to stimulate new investment? 

That's not necessary to stimulate anything. They'll produce a little revenue now. You'll lose it down the road when you need revenue again to start fighting the deficit. There are other kinds of tax cuts that are far better at stimulating the economy. There's even some that are far better at stimulating investment. 

I want to get to tax cuts in a minute, but give me your own assessment of where we are? On the one hand, Larry says things are getting better, growth looks good, and Wolman says -- 

Well, I mean (indiscernible) Larry - I think to Larry's prognosis, interest rates have been coming down for a long time, it hasn't helped, housing starts aren't back up. Inflation has been down for an awful long time. The bond market still refuses to breathe and interest rates are still too high. There are 20-year lows on interest rates. They're still too high. How can he possibly say that? Who says they're too high. They're still too high. Let me tell you the impact of defining long-term interest rates. Let me finish. The people who say it's too high are the consumers, the homebuyers, the businessmen who aren't investing, the very people who you say should be provoked by -- Larry, we've gone through this scenario before. 

But why are median home prices rising? National home prices are up for the last two quarters, why is that? 

Charlie, help out here. 

Well, okay. We'll answer that question. We'll come back. All right, Jeff has the floor, Larry. 

Housing starts are not good, Larry. Consumer spending is not - 

Consumer spending -- 

Let him finish, Larry. Larry, we -- 

In October we lost jobs. This needle in the haystack, you know, you got to admit that this economy is far worse than it's been. We can have the longest running recession we have ever had in the post-World War II period. And if you write about '92, a 3% recovery is crumby. It's paltry. And the four years of Bush will be the slow -- 

Tom Herman of the Wall Street Journal wants to get in on this. 

Thank you, Charlie. There is the middle ground here. Most of the bankers and economists I talk to are not nearly as gloomy as Jeff, or even as Bill, but they're not nearly as optimistic as Larry. They say that the economy is beginning to turn around, but it looks like a very slow ocean liner. The economy is not making a U-turn. It's making a very slow, gradual turn. 

What's causing it to make that turn and -- 

Lower interest rates. That's the main factor. 

It is driven by -- so these people are -- 

This gloom reminds me very much of the gloom that we heard almost exactly ten years ago. Interest rates were double-digit levels. Everybody said stay out of stocks. This is terrible. And the economy began to turn a year later. A lot of the people I talk to now say that the economy will respond to discount rate cuts. There have been five already. Two more probably coming early next year. And the economy probably will begin to perk up. 

Good work. Good work. Charlie, I got to tell you, everybody's saying everybody's too gloomy. The fact of the matter -- and that the press is too gloomy. The fact of the matter with the press has been far too optimistic and generous in interpreting what's going on in the economy. Oh, for heaven's sake. All the press overreacted to the recovery that allegedly started in May. Since May, Charlie, employment has gone up by 288,000 people. Of that, 250,000 are in the health care services. It's the "bedpan recovery," Charlie. There's almost nothing else that's gone up. So then why is it that the stock -- The press has understated the seriousness of this situation. The press, all the leading papers have filed all these front page stories about the gloom and doom. The fact of the matter is -- 

Not only that, they're saying that the gloom and doom has become a factor. 

Yeah, and it's getting worse. But this is America, not Bangladesh. Now I ask you, why is it that the stock market for the last 12 months has been rising? And why is it that the most economically sensitive stocks, the NASDAQ small stocks are outperforming everything else? Do we have to count the -- Doesn't that mean anything? Yes, it does. It's great stuff. 

Should we count the times and count the ways the stock market has been wrong in the past? 

Jeff, you're a non-market guy. 

Was it right in 1969? Was it right in 1974? Is it right now? 

Yes. Yes. 

The idea that the stock market is right is absurd. 

It was right in '82. It was right in '69. When the stock market rallies during a recession it's a forecast of the future. And what the stock market is trying to tell us - Often an incorrect forecast. The stock market is trying to tell us that declining interest rates and declining inflation rates will improve growth. You guys have been talking about recovery for six months and it has not materialized. Let me add one more point. One factor creeping into the stock market is the fact that there is a populist stack revolt going on in this country. And there's going to be across the board tax cuts in 1992 which is going to get this economy back to the growth rate -- 

Let me jump in on tax cuts. That's a good point to make because there are a lot of people saying that when you face a $400 billion deficit next year, tax cuts will have zero impact, and that the deficit remains the principal. 

You see, one of the things that I learned working in the government and observing in the 1980s when I was out of government is whatever the Congress or whatever the government says on deficits you reverse the sign. Tax cuts, particularly if they're incentivizing tax cuts to help the long-term economy growth, will increase revenues and reduce the budget deficit. A year ago we were told that tax increases, the luxury act, the income tax, the business taxes, were going to reduce the deficit. What happened? The deficit grew larger. 

In 1981 the deficit was what -- you were in the government -- about $78 billion, right? 

Well, actually -- 

It will be next year $400 billion. 

In the recession it was about $200 billion. And in that recession there were massive tax cuts, you know, in 1982. (CROSS-TALKING). So the fact of the matter is, the deficit really rose. The deficit diminished. For eight years we had the longest expansion in peace time in American history. And the deficit fell. 

And there are people now who are saying that we now have to pay the price for that expansion. 

This is an anti-Reagan fantasy run wild by the Eastern media. The fact remains that tax cuts on capital gains, tax cuts for the middle class on payrolls enhanced saving better business depreciation will get this economy growing. Not 3%, but 5% or 6%. 

And do you go along with your friend, Jack Kemp, who also is for an extension of unemployment benefits? 

Jack Kemp is the only member of Bush's cabinet who has the story right because he understands that all Americans have to have opportunities to grow. And if Bush would listen to Kemp he might be re-elected. 

Okay, Tom Herman. 

There is one big problem with placing too much emphasis on federal tax cuts, even if we get them next year. 

What's that? 

And the problem is that state and local governments are raising taxes all over the place. Just ask anyone from New Jersey. Just ask anyone lately from Connecticut. Next week, in fact, Connecticut voters are going to assemble to try and "axe the tax," as they put it. 

But why are they doing that, those states? 

Because state and local government budgets are way out of whack and they can't just print money, unlike Uncle Sam. 

They have to balance their budget. (CROSS-TALKING) 

And that's another reason why so many people I talk to say they don't have any money to spend. But that shows the populist tax revolt. You've had -- I mean not only did the Republicans -- But you can't have federal cuts helping that much if state and local governments are going to take it back. No, you don't understand. It will set the tone. The states are suffering from the lack of economic growth. I want (indiscernible) Larry Kudlow has not said whether the economy is in recession right now. 

Oh, I think it's in recovery. 

I've got to tell you, Charlie, that I think that consumer tax cuts right now are a full employment program from Malaysia, okay. You give consumers tax cuts right now, they're just going to spend the money abroad on imports. I do agree with these tax cuts. I think we need tax cuts on business, on investment, because you have to invest and save in order to grow. 

Do you believe that a cut in capital gains will remain a stimulus to the business community and therefore and also will result therefore in revenues coming in from startups and businesses that will produce more savings? 

Not taken by itself. I take a capital gains cut over a consumer tax cut, but there are other kinds I'd rather have. I'd rather have other kinds of tax cuts. I also -- what I notice is a radical appeal only shared by Richard Nixon, there may be some argument of reviving the old Republican idea, Larry, of more (indiscernible) to the states. That might do them a lot of good in terms of what happens in spending and taxation. I really have to protest this. 

All right. Go ahead. 

Larry Kudlow filibuster. 

Yeah. All right, I'm going to come to you right now. 

Because if he keeps talking there can be no other view. 

Tell me what you think -- let me come to his strong and long held belief in tax cuts and what he thinks was how they were a stimulus to growth during the '80s, a whole series. Now we have faced in the Bush administration a long period of declining growth, have we not, Larry? 

That is correct. 

Maybe the longest slow period. 

Because he's been raising taxes. 

Tell me what you think the impact of a tax cut would be? It's clearly politically popular. 

It would be very good for the economy because I fear, unlike Larry, that the economy may be sinking again. Unlike the people Tom spoke to, lower interest rates could mean that we will still get lower interest rates. We've gone through periods like this where low inflation and low interest rates simply didn't matter. Let me mention, for example, the 1930s when your kinds of people were saying precisely the same thing. Tax cuts, however, are stimulative not nearly because or not principally because they're incentives, but because the economy needs some spending and investment power. 

Do you believe we will see tax cuts? 

I think we will see tax cuts. 

And what kind of tax cuts? 

Because we're going to continue to get a very weak economy, not merely because there's a tax revolt. There's a lot of disenchantment. But because the economy will -- 

And because Democrats now are trying to appeal to the middle class and they're talking about tax cuts. 

George Bush will start advocating more tax cuts in a couple of months because we could very well continue to lose jobs. If he's willing to buck the advice of the senior advisors. 

Darman and such -- wait, let's hear this out. Darman and Sununu don't -- 

Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu -- Well I think there's a big -- there's a big reason -- -- who have, because of their intransigence and their insularity from American voters and taxpayers, have given Bush such bad advice that he is - But, Charlie, there is some insularity here and I think -- 

Hold on. 

Will both Kemp and Brady be in the cabinet next year or is one going to go? I hope for George Bush's sake and the American economy's sake that Bush's senior staff is not there next year. 

Come on in, Tom. 

Charlie, there is one other idea that I've heard bandied about that may catch fire. Don't just cut the capital gains tax across the board. Have a higher capital gains tax on short-term gains. Why give them a break for a stock that's held six months? Haven an incentive to hold long term. 

The idea is to promote savings. 

Exactly. 

All right. Let me raise another question. The IRA is now being bandied about by a lot of politicians in Washington. Do you expect to see a change in the way the tax code treats IRAs and will that be a stimulus to savings or anything else? 

Yes. Yes, absolutely. I know very few people who expect social security around when we retire. Social security is going to be a basket case in ten or 15 years. A lot of people I know say we'd much rather depend on our IRAs, we'd much rather have back those incentives. Senator Benson is fully committed to it and there are dozens of bills out there that would also bring back the IRAs. 

Jack Kemp likes it, too. 

Yeah, I don't have a problem with that, but the basic deal here to get the economy moving is to reduce the capital gains tax for investment and to reduce the social security payroll tax - Across the board on capital gains? No, it's across the board tax cut. (CROSS-TALKING). Productivity in the American economy did not grow very much during the 80s, with all due respect. There is no evidence that a capital gains cut is what we need. We need something to increase productivity growth. It's got to do with investment and education and infrastructure. 

What would increase productivity? 

Investment in -- 

And how do you generate that investment? 

Well the answer to that question -- 

What incentives are there to generate that investment? 

The answer to that question is you go out and you do it. You reallocate funds within the budget to do it. Just for the heck of it. No, not just for the heck of it. The rate of return doesn't matter? There's a strong evidence that infrastructure investment will increase productivity growth. Larry, the investment is overwhelming. It is overwhelming. Also in education. It's silly to argue otherwise. 

You think spending public money, say, to rebuild the infrastructure of this country will not people -- will not generate -- wait, generate employment, number one, and therefore generate jobs and therefore product more spending in the economy? 

It is not a recurring profit in income stream. It's nothing but a short term quick fix. However, having said that, I would argue that what we need to do is get the risk-taking animal spirits going again by providing a sufficient rate of return on capital investment. And if that works and if the economy grows, then revenues will flow in so we have enough money for infrastructure, enough money for education, enough money for 

This is correct. The last statement made is correct. We have to get the economy growing. 

Go ahead. 

But the way to get the economy growing is, and it has been demonstrated before, government spending, certain kinds of tax cuts to get money back into the stream. It has worked before. It is very hard to argue. I think the lower capital gains taxes have worked before. We have a stock market boom despite those high capital gains taxes. 

Let me raise some issues just generally. Others have been talking about this. In order to get the economy going and to reduce the deficit and free up capital for private investment, which a lot of people believe will do it, one, that we ought to raise taxes on gasoline. 

Yeah, it's a good idea. 

Good idea? 

I think it's a dreadful idea. 

A dreadful idea? 

A dreadful idea. It's an excellent idea because there's no shortage of energy at low cost and we don't need higher taxes in a recession. 

Reduce taxes on mortgage interest? 

Well -- 

The tax benefits. 

Yes, but look, it's -- 

Good idea or bad idea? 

It's simpler and more equitable to just have rate reductions across the board than -- 

And not play around with tax breaks in terms of -- 

Simplification is a good theme here. 

So 1986 tax reform was a great deal. 

Well, it started out to be a great deal. It ended up being a rather poor deal. I have some doubts that this was -- I think we have to start thinking about investment tax credits again, appreciation -- 

So that breaks the '86 -- tax neutrality of the '86 tax reform. 

And I was a big fan of the '86 tax, and I'm worried because this economy seems to be so stagnant. 

How about doing something about agricultural subsidies? 

Well, we should be reforming agricultural subsidies, but it's not a major issue. It's not an issue -- 

How about tax on entitlements? 

Oh, no, that's not the answer. The answer is to grow the economy, Charlie. That's the trick. 

But, Larry, that's -- everybody believes that the answer is to make the economy grow. The question is how do you generate growth in the economy. 

Okay, so let's make a deal in Washington. And this is what I think's going to happen. You've got the Kemp and Kasten and so forth capital gains. On the other side you've got the Moynihan payroll tax cuts to the middle class, and then you add the Bentsen IRAs, and you've got yourself a witch's brew that will grow this economy and reduce the budget deficit and throw off resources. 

I just think it's another -- will lead to another round of the consumer's excessive consumer spending and excessive consumer get of the kind (indiscernible) right now. 

Will we see a peace dividend? Do you think there will be a peace dividend? 

There will be a peace dividend if Congress gives us one. There can be a peace dividend. There can be definitely a peace dividend. 

Hold on, Larry. 

And it can be used very productively. 

How would it be used productively? 

Well I think there has to be public spending. Give me about 30 seconds, Larry. There should be public spending. There has to be infrastructure spending. There has to be the sort of spending that raises the educational level of our people. You know, it's not that we created bad jobs in the '80s. And I think we're forgetting -- we're forgetting that the '80s was not the best kind of expansion we've ever had, but it wasn't so much that there were bad - 

Because the deficit went up so much? 

The deficit went up a lot. The deficit went down in the '80s. Incomes for lots of people didn't go up. 

From $71 billion to where it is now, it's going down? You may have percentage of GNP, what's your point, just from the percentage of GNP? 

At the height of the recession the deficit was 6.5% of GNP. After eight years of expansion the deficit was 3% of GNP. 

And where did we spend the majority, the largest amount of the federal budget goes for what purpose? Just tell me. 

Entitlements, Medicare and Social Security is by far the biggest. 

And where is interest payments on that? 

Interest payments is a close third, but keep in mind because inflation and interest rates have come down, that's going to help reduce the deficit. 

All right. The economy next year, your prediction? 

It could be in recession again. Could be a very serious problem. 

And the market will follow it -- the stock market will follow it? 

I think it probably will. Coming after a long period of very slow growth in incomes and no growth in incomes for a lot of people. I think a very weak first half of next year and probably recovery in the second half. The stock market is going to stay strong, however, because the Fed's going to continue to ease and the market does not go down when the Federal Reserve is easing. 

If interest rates are going down the market will continue to go up regardless of what's happening in the economy? 

It will not go down, Charlie. It will not go down. It's a fairly safe investment at this point. 

So Alan Greenspan will look after Wall Street? 

Well, not the way -- you said that, buddy, not me. 

Larry? 

At least 3% growth next year. With tax cuts, 4%. The Dow is going to 3400 and it's going to 4000 the year after that. 

So you're asking all your clients to be fully invested? 

Fully invested. 

All right. 

Actually, that's not bad advice based on history. History shows that since 1904 presidential election years are a great time to buy stocks. The Federal Reserve is usually pumping the economy up. The average was something like 10% since 1904. And in the last seven presidential years they've been up strongly six of those years, double digits in most cases. I think it's usually better the year before the -- No, it's the 12 months from November to November, Bill. 

I'm out of time. 

Listen, we need some optimism. That's the key point. Cheerleading is what we -- 

Well we do need it. We do need optimism generally. 

Based in reality. (CROSS-TALKING). 

The polls are saying that the sourness that people feel has become a factor in terms of their investment, in terms of how they react. 

Charlie, it's gone too far, this pessimism. (CROSS-TALKING) (Inaudible) the reality out there. People are worried. 

Think positive. 

You can food some of the people some of the time, et cetera. 

Thank you. It will clearly be an issue. Domestic issues will be at the paramount, at the top of the political campaign, and we can all watch that with great enthusiasm. I thank all of you. We'll do this again. We continue after this break. Stay with us. Magic Johnson's candor on his HIV infection has transformed a personal tragedy into a national opportunity to fight AIDS. Dr. Mathilde Krim has been confronting the epidemic since 1982 when she founded the organization which would become the American Foundation for AIDS Research. She joins us now to talk about AIDS research and how this new attention can help. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

Does it -- I mean, everybody talks about the courage, the candor, the humanity of Magic Johnson. 

Every word is justified, yes. 

The world is talking about it, in fact. 

Yes. 

I mean, I see a lot of press attention here. What impact do you expect to see in the areas of concern to you? 

Oh, I think Magic's words and attitude have really profoundly touched everybody, and even people who have never given much thought to AIDS and have not listened very well to what people like me have been saying for many years. This time they have felt the message and they are shaken by it. They are frightened, I suppose. And they are thinking about their personal risk is, what their role is in the situation, and I appreciate these kinds of programs as we have tonight because if helps the public think about it. 

Will it generate and do you expect it to generate more money for research? 

Eventually it will, but I think what it will generate, which is even more important, is a change in attitudes and in perspectives. I think, hopefully, it will produce, elicit some leadership in this country, more leadership, first of all, then political leadership. Political determination on the part of our leaders and the people who matter in this society. 

Let me talk about the moral leadership you mean. You mean moral leadership in order to give higher priority and step out front and talk about AIDS and -- what do you mean by moral leadership? 

Moral leadership is first of all to recognize that every life is valuable and it's not a question of "us" and "them." We are all in it together. Each life has as much value as another one. And we must feel compassion and feel concern for those affected, who were affected earlier, who are still affected very much today, particularly now that we see this epidemic, like all infectious disease by the way, it's not unusual in this respect. Moving from certain middle class urban groups to rural areas and to low economic groups and minority people. It is very important that we develop a sense of human solidarity. 

Yeah. I assume that Magic Johnson's announcement will have a significant impact, or maybe not, in terms of behavior, in terms of practicing safe sex. 

Absolutely, because there he has been very blunt and very clear, and it is wonderful that somebody can speak in such simple terms and so directly, particularly to young people. 

Do you think he should accept this position the President has offered him on the National Commission? 

Yes, because hopefully he will give some visibility to the National Commission. We have had a wonderful commission, it's in fact the second one. We had the Presidential Commission a couple of years ago. Now we have a national commission. 

That was Admiral Watkins. Who was -- 

He was the chairman, yes. 

Right. And you're disappointed that the political leadership has not listened to the commission. 

That's right. The government is not responding. 

Why not? 

You shouldn't ask me. I don't understand why not. Again, I think lack of sensitivity, lack of compassion, and lack of understanding of the real threat there is in this epidemic for everyone, because you know this is not an epidemic like the influenza epidemic in the earlier part of the century which became self-limiting and disappeared by itself because most people infected with the flu virus developed antibody to the virus, became immunized against it, and the virus ran out of people it could infect after a couple of years. With HIV, which attacks the very cells of the immune system, nobody develops immunity against it, and therefore this virus is going to go around as long as there are people who are not infected. The only way to control it is through medical means, a vaccine and treatments. 

And how close are we to a vaccine? 

I think we are ten years away of having a vaccine for the general protection 

For general protection we're ten years -- and if we had the same kind of national commitment as we had for the Manhattan Project or for "man on the moon" and with President Kennedy and had unlimited funds to do it, could it cut it to five years? 

No, I don't think so. 

Could it cut it to eight years? Would it make a significant difference or just -- 

And when I say ten years it may be eight years, it may be 12 years, but that's an order of magnitude. No, there is a lot of more basic, fundamental research we have to do on this disease. We still don't understand, for example, exactly how the virus destroys the immune system. Why does it kill certain cells and not others? These are the kinds of things we still have to understand because also if we want to develop treatments and a vaccine that are effective we have to understand the kind of immunity that's effective against this virus. We still don't understand these things very well. 

What's happening around the world? Why is there, for example, the dramatic difference in heterosexual transmission, say, in Africa and the United States? 

Well the difference is not between the virus' we have there and the virus we have here. It's not even between what people do with each other in terms of sexual behavior. There is a difference in social organization between African countries and Western countries. In Western countries where people have more ability to travel and to choose where they live, to choose the people they want to live with, they tend to segregate themselves into community that develop their own culture. And one of these communities is the gay community. In the '70s, because the gay community existed in settlements, so to speak, in large urban centers. And the virus happened to land in this country in one of them in New York. And one of the cultural traits of that community was great sexual freedom and high levels of sexual activities. This virus had a chance to move around within that community. And because this is a virus that does not cause immediate disease, quite the contrary, there is an enormous incubation period between infection and the appearance of clinical symptoms. We see today among the people sick with AIDS a large number of gay men, but they became infected ten years ago before we knew anything about the virus. And there are other groups, for example, Hispanic people in this country tend to live also in community as not entirely separate but with their own identity and their own culture, and we have many other examples of this. And these communities tolerate, more or less, certain behaviors. For example, in the Hispanic community homosexuality is not tolerated. We know that. But there are homosexual men of course in that community. So as a result many of them marry and raise families and have wives but they also have a secret life of their own. 

Secret homosexual life. 

Yes. And this is something that in the Hispanic community one doesn't like to talk about very well, but it's a reality. And this exists for also among Mormons, for example. I was in Utah and I was amazed at the way the problem of homosexuality among men there is completely hidden. Nobody talks about it. Nobody admits it. But they exist of course, like everywhere else. 

And when that happens what is the impact with respect to AIDS when you have that? 

Well, that these married men lead a double life and in their underground life they may meet men who have become infected because -- 

So, therefore, they're more likely to spread it within a heterosexual community because they have a dual -- 

That's right, they have a wife and they can spread the virus to the wife and to the children. 

In what community is it spreading the fastest? 

Well I couldn't tell you in terms of community today, but the group in which it spreads the fastest now are women and babies and newborns. 

And why is that? 

Because we had these massive men infected, becoming infected ten years ago, many of them are bisexuals, as I just mentioned. Many of them are drug users. They may have acquired the virus through sharing contaminated needles, but most of them are heterosexuals and they have wives and girlfriends and they are transmitting the virus to these women and their babies. And, in fact, not only is the incidence of AIDS rising faster among women and children, but if you look, because AIDS in these women was also acquired several years ago. If you look at the incidence or the prevalence of infection among them, it is very high, much higher than we would imagine. When we think of the situation ten years ago, ten years ago there was one woman for each 13 or 14 men with AIDS. Five years ago, there was one woman for eight men. Today it's one woman per 2.5 men. And among teenagers the sex ratio is one to one, for each man there is an infected woman, or for each boy there is an infected girl. 

One last question before we go to a larger discussion here, is it myth or reality that it is harder -- heterosexual transmission is much more difficult than -- 

No. 

No. 

No. I think that's another myth. A few years ago we were saying, you know, you need for this virus to be inoculated in blood for transmission to occur. We know that's not true. Then it was said overt homosexual sex is more traumatic and that therefore transmission is easier. I'm not so sure. I don't think so. The only thing in this -- because also, it makes sense and therefore I also believe it, is that transmission is easier for men to woman than vice versa. 

For obvious reasons 

Obviously. But that's all and that's only a question of time. When people are together for one year and they have sex a few hundred times, the difference doesn't count anymore either, you know. Whichever way the virus has to go, it has gone so after one year of cohabitation. 

One last question before I go. What makes you optimistic today other than the Magic Johnson, this impact of his announcement? 

Well, because I believer very much in the power of modern biology, I review each year hundreds and hundreds of applications. 

So it's a confidence in what you know. 

In what I know. And I see the number of different approaches, you know, the sophistication of what we can do. The only thing is that some of these things will take time, you know, a question of years before they can be applied. But the avenues are there. We know exactly where we are going. We have a choice of different approaches. It's only a matter of amount of effort and work in real time. But within ten years we're going to have the situation under control. 

By the year 2000. 

Yes. And before that we'll have treatments effective enough -- 

To extend the life of people with -- 

To keep people alive, and rather well, and try and start treating them very early following infection. 

We have a lot more questions, we'll do that when we come back and we'll be joined by some other guests. Stay with us. Dr. Mathilde Krim, talking about AIDS and looking to the future. Stay with us. Next we'll talk about what the scientific community really knows about the relationship between HIV and AIDS and the affect that this has had on our nation's research priorities. Joining our discussion now, Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, who has a large AIDS practice, is one of the first to treat the disease; Gregg Gonsalves, an AIDS treatments activist from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power; and Celia Farber who has covered the epidemic for Spin Magazine. Welcome. Talk to me and explain to me Peter Duesberg and what he says, just so that I can understand it because it has gotten more attention lately because of these scientific journals. You shake your head, I know, and let me just sort of bear with the community here that's watching us because there is almost no support for his position and therefore it does a disservice to talk about it or what? Tell me. Help me understand this and why it's a source of friction and a source of --. 

The kind of questions he has asked were legitimate a few years ago, absolutely. 

He basically said is there a real connection between HIV virus and AIDS. 

That's right. He said how do you know HIV causes AIDS, maybe it doesn't, maybe it's another opportunistic infection. Maybe other things cause 

Years of -- 

Yeah, so these are legitimate questions, but they have been refuted because the evidence is overwhelming that 

But Nature Magazine, as you know, read the editorial was saying that more attention should be paid to his views. Now, you read that. Did you say -- 

That was refuted, too, by many scientists who said that was a crazy editorial. 

Charlie, those studies were small unconfirmed studies, and I think that editorial pointed more towards the scientific community's anxiety about what we don't know about AIDS. 

Yes. 

And, you know, after ten years of research we still don't know how people get sick. We don't know about the genesis of the disease. 

That's right. That's right. But that doesn't -- it's absolutely right, Gregg, that we don't know enough about the pathogenesis, but that does not invalidate the thinking, the thought that HIV is really a necessary cause. 

Dr. Sonnabend. 

About this editorial in relation to Peter Duesberg, one thing is that it had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Peter Duesberg, and that was the puzzle to many of us. Peter Duesberg's contention, I believe, is that HIV cannot be the cause of AIDS. The papers that the editorial referred to didn't dispute HIV's role at all. None of them questioned the role of HIV in AIDS. So the connection with Peter Duesberg -- 

I think, in fact, Peter Duesberg himself said there is no connection, I think he said that. 

Yes, that's true. He did actually. He was reported to have said so. 

But is it because - why does his theory continue to be discussed? I mean, I'm doing it here because of what those two scientific journals did. Celia, jump in because Spin Magazine has focused on this, and you've interviewed Duesberg. 

Yes, several times. Because there are gaping in the theory that HIV singlehandedly destroys the immune system and causes AIDS. There are many problems with that theory, legitimate problems. 

What's the gaping hole? 

Well, one, the most important one really, is that it has not -- we do not know the mechanism by which HIV kills T cells. It has not been proven to kill enough T cells to explain the phenomena that is AIDS. At the very most it kills one in 500 T cells, which cannot explain any of the devastation seen in AIDS. 

That's in the body. In the test tube it kills more than that. 

That's only one point. 

And in the body it doesn't kill -- in the test tube does kill more T cells? 

No, I'll tell you one time -- 

T cells, as I understand it, are those cells that are responsible for the body's immune system. 

Or some of the cells that are responsible, but they are very important ones. 

You know, we could go on about the minutia of Peter Duesberg's theory, but we also have to go after the fact that for people who are sick and living with AIDS the lack of this knowledge that we have around the pathogenesis in the disease is keeping us from mounting other treatment strategies. 

Perhaps. 

Because we don't know how the virus goes about wreaking its havoc on the immune system we can't intervene with other steps in the disease. 

Yeah. No, you are right. 

Go ahead. 

That leads to something very important that we should say on the air is that this lack of understanding is what requires much more basic research than we have been able or we have done so far. 

Yes, but, too, I think the first thing we have to do is to admit that we don't have this understanding. And I think we of course would all admit it here. But I think one has to point out that a very major tragedy happened I think in 1984 when a model of AIDS was accepted which said that HIV alone, without the intervention of any other factor, could decimate the immune system. This is what you might call the Pac-Man model or what's called the "Mack truck model," no cofactors are involved. Time is the only cofactor. That was said frequently in about 1984. 

And that was not true? 

We know better now. 

It's not true, but as a result of that decision, the acceptance of that notion that HIV alone is a killer virus, nothing else was required, as a result of accepting that we put all of our resources into one direction. That's to say into the study of HIV and many promising leads that were not connected with HIV were simply just not taken up, including autoimmunity and a variety of other things. The consequence I think is that we have learned a tremendous amount about HIV and really almost nothing about AIDS as a disease. 

Yeah. Celia? 

I agree fully with Joe. The consequences that we've developed, drugs with the specific purpose of targeting 

Before I just close off the Duesberg thing, Peter Duesberg thing, do you, as someone who's written about this, believe there is some merit, just you as one reporter? 

Yeah. 

You do? 

Do I believe that there's merit to Peter Duesberg? 

Yes. 

Yes, I do. I cannot say as a journalist that I -- since I'm not a scientist I can't say that I believe that he's right, but I think there's merit. I think he's a very prominent scientist and it would be madness to not listen to him. 

May I just ask one thing, because you're in touch with him more than I guess I am. It's my belief that he said that 

It's a very good question because of a lot of reasons. 

He's categorically said, that is his position, cannot -- that HIV cannot be the cause of AIDS. He has said that categorically. 

And I'm saying I will -- 

I don't know how he knows that, if he's got a crystal ball, but I don't know how he knows that. 

I think that it needs to be looked into, which is why I support the very fact of his existence. And I think he's -- 

Even though he has said HIV could not be the cause. 

And this, you know, it's sort of upsetting because these are theoretical quibbles. In terms of people with 

Tell me what's important to ask. 

Oh, don't say that. 

Wait. Wait. 

No, let's be truthful, Dr. Krim. AZT and ddi have a limited window of effectiveness. 

But there are many other possible antivirals. 

The reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, the next class of drugs coming up, all of a sudden started to show resistance at 12 weeks. You know, what is going to happen now? 

Any single drug will elicit resistance. We have to have enough drugs to use them in combination or in sequence. 

What I'm proposing is that we need to overhaul basic biomedical research. 

We need to do more of it. 

We've gone after clinical research. We need to go after the basic research. 

What does that mean, overhaul basic research? 

AIDS activists went into the clinical research system and reformulated it, speeded up trials, got drugs out to people, speeded up availability of drugs. We need to go and make the basic research on 

And shorten the time span between -- 

Shorten the time span, we need to coordinate efforts. There are dozens of government agencies working on different topics. 

While you've got all these people here, you know, what questions ought we be asking, just from your perspective? What questions should I be asking? What questions should journalists be asking? What questions would you want to pose to a larger community? 

I would open that up to the debate. Do a sperm (ph) series one. 

But we've done that. 

The two hospitalists (ph) mentioned in the Nature article are one, Michael Ascher and Charlie Shepherd over in Berkeley have another hypothesis. We need to open the debate and get a discourse going around what is going on in AIDS pathogenesis. 

Just to repeat the idea that I brought up earlier, there was -- I think a tragedy happened in 1984 when Margaret Heckler converted really what was really a speculation into a fact, that fact being that only - 

Was this the Congress? 

No, it was the secretary. 

The secretary of HHS. 

Who announced to the world as a result of which the view that was accepted was that HIV alone -- it wasn't called HIV then -- but HIV, a new agent, HTLV-III as it was called then, alone could cause AIDS, that no other factors were necessary. This has to be changed now. We have to broaden our research agenda. There were many promising leads that were apparent even in 1981, 1982, for example. We discovered autoimmunity in 1982. 

What's autoimmunity? 

It's when the body attacks itself. And we discovered that in 1982. If autoimmunity plays a role in this disease we've lost years, absolutely years. 

And now they're bringing it up as if it's something new. 

(Inaudible) have been discarded. 

And there has been evidence for autoimmune phenomena for a long time. Do you remember when in 1984 when those French scientists treated people with cyclosporine and they found that it had -- 

Some improvement. 

It had some effect? 

Yes. 

But autoimmunity is only one thing that we knew then. We knew that, for example, herpes viruses is not just simply herpes simplex but cytomegalovirus which is a member of the herpes virus group was highly prevalent in people with AIDS and that this virus itself has -- 

The herpes virus tended to stimulate the -- 

Right, these are cofactors. 

It was a legitimate cofactor, for example, herpes, that's a further example. Alloimmunization, it's a big word but that refers to the people being exposed to the tissues of other people. Now alloimmunization has an immunosuppressive potential. It was brought up as a possibility even before 1984 and it was thrown out. It's coming back today. 

Okay. Celia? 

When people talk about cofactors it's as if they are not so important, it's as if 

But you know what the point is, we can't wait another ten years. It's been ten years and we've gotten no answers. 

We've lost so much. 

But I want to know why the emphasis on HIV - 

Yeah, go ahead. 

Why the emphasis on 

Okay, this is reflective of what we've talked about, Duesberg. Why do you think the entire, almost the entire scientific community -- 

Went along with this? 

Is against what Duesberg is saying? 

No, but we're not talking about Duesberg anymore. We're way beyond him right now. We are saying that there are other -- 

Let Dr. Krim finish, please. 

There is HIV plus other important phenomena. 

Contributing factors. 

Contributing factors in the body like other viruses - 

What did the science article say, it said we've been fed baby talk. 

Yeah, a simplistic picture. 

John Maddox, who's the editor of Nature Magazine, he wrote this editorial that in fact the reason why we're here. And when questioned, what has this got to do with Duesberg, he said he was provoked to write this editorial because he was fed up with the baby talk that was presented to him. The baby talk is the simple-minded view that 

It's much more complicated. 

And this has nothing to do with Peter. 

Can you give me some optimism, some sense of -- I mean, I hear the pessimism that Gregg has and the eloquence of his questions. 

Well the optimism that I have is that I think that there are observations that are coming up now which cannot be blamed solely on 

And if you could then -- 

And this is, I believe, that as these are observations they cannot be suppressed any longer. At a certain point it was impossible to get funding to do research that was not directly related to HIV. I think that situation is changing. I think even the people who brought us HIV itself as a killer virus, Dr. Fauci himself I think who said it was a Mack truck, or was that Dr. Gallo? 

No, I think that was Gallo. 

Now we're speaking about autoimmunity. Dr. Gallo himself is speaking about other factors. So there is an openness now, not a whole lot more. 

A little more sophistication. 

We've got to expedite it though. 

And we expedite it how? 

How do we do it? 

More research. 

We find out what research is being done, how it's being done. We offer our criticism and we advocate for it. We lobby for it in Congress. We go to the researchers themselves. 

Dr. Krim. 

You know, we have to be careful. There is a biomedical research community. We should not give the impression that we are very narrow or very provincial in what -- when we talk about doing more research. We're talking about basic biomedical research, whether you call it AIDS research or cancer research or viral research, it doesn't matter very much. We're looking -- we need to understand more about some very basic biologic facts that are relevant to this disease. 

Which we do not know now. 

We do not know now. And they will be relevant to cancer and they will be relevant to multiple sclerosis and -- 

Autoimmune diseases. 

And other diseases. 

One should say, I think the best or the most spectacular research advance that has come out of >>AIDS research has been the studies on the molecular biology of HIV: Do you share what Dr. Krim told me in the previous segment about in ten years we will -- there will be dramatic -- 

Advances. 

-- advances? 

Oh, I believe so, particularly as research broadens, if in fact we continue to push as researchers. 

And what do you think the breakthrough will be? 

Oh, I think it will be some progress towards an understanding of pathogenesis, which means the mechanisms by which -- 

Of how it starts? 

Oh, no, of how it develops, how the disease develops. 

Celia, I wanted just to give you one last word. 

Well I think Joe has a case in point of the optimism you're referring to because thanks to his more sophisticated view of how >>AIDS is caused he has approached his clientele with a more sophisticated way to treat the disease: I mean, I'm optimistic as well as the next guy, but I also think we need to prod it along. Science works very slowly. 

And how do we prod it? 

Encourage more people - more broader - 

Discussion like this. 

And also broader research. 

Generate more attention from politicians. 

Remember, Waxman held hearings on opportunistic infection research a few years ago, and all of a sudden all this research on opportunistic infections. Let's hold the hearings on pathogenesis -- 

And that was very neglected in the past. 

Yeah, let's hold a hearing on pathogenesis and get people interested in it. 

And one should also point out that much of the research has been virological research, which has in its own sense been spectacular, but immunological research has really -- 

Immunology is very complicated, very complex, and it will require an enormous effort. And we must learn to also use products of the immune system such as the cytokines and the interferons and the growth factors, they're going to be necessary for the treatment, the effective treatment of AIDS in the future. And this is a world of work that remains to be done. And that will also be a factor useful to dozens of other diseases, not just AIDS. 

Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Sonnabend. Thank you, Celia. Thank you, Gregg. We'll be back in just a moment. Martin Kingsley here. Stay with us. Martin Amis is here. Kingsley Amis is his father. And we'll be back and talk about his new book. Stay with us. Okay, let me come - I guess he's not here. Maybe he's not here, but let me continue the conversation here while we (inaudible) to the focus. Here is what -- that a lot of people are also asking with respect to the Bush administration, what more should be expect from the Bush administration? 

Everything because there's been virtually nothing. 

By not speaking to the issue, by not giving it the priority, what else? 

That's one thing, about acknowledging the situation, by not publically acknowledging and supporting. 

And all the work done by the National Commission on AIDS -- 

That's been (inaudible) work but the recommendations have not been heated. 

That's my point. 

That's exactly the situation. 

I mean, it's really scandalous. 

Yeah. 

The recommendations were excellent. We have no quarrel with any of them. But he doesn't listen. 

FDR could do it for polio. 

That's right. 

Do you think that there will be more of a political consciousness because of Magic Johnson? 

Yes, undoubtedly. 

Undoubtedly, yeah. Thank you again. 

But you know why I mentioned this business that basic research helps, you know, progress across the board is because I've already heard -- and it's only four days ago, right, Magic Johnson -- that people are already saying, "Well all these AIDS people, you know, they want privileged status as opposed to cancer and heart disease and other things, and they're going to grab all these resources and all this money and take it from." 

But basic research is going to help everybody. 

Well this is why -- 

I'm out of time unfortunately. They give me a cut sign, that means I've got to get out. We'll be right back.
