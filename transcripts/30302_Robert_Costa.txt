We begin this evening with politics. President Trump is vying to bounce back from recent setbacks punctuated last week by the failure of his party's effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Doubts are rising about the president's ability to achieve progress on other aspects of an ambitious agenda, as the White House begins turning its attention to tax reform. Joining me now is Robert Costa of "The Washington Post." On Friday, he received a phone call from the president, breaking news that a vote on the GOP health care bill would not proceed. I'm pleased to have Robert Costa back on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

I once asked Donald Trump when he was at "CBS This Morning," who he thought understood him. And he mentioned your name. How did this happen so that you are the reporter he wants to call to say we're pulling the bill? 

Well, as you know, we discussed on this program before, I've been covering him for quite some time. I've gotten to know him as a candidate, as a businessman, now as president of the United States. I'd been working on this story with my colleagues about Trump as a deal maker. Could he cut his first deal, his first legislative test, health care, trying to wade into Congress, a realm he didn't really know, didn't understand all the factions and the players. I'd been working on this for about a week and, as usual, put in an interview request, but didn't expect anything. Hadn't interviewed the president since before the inauguration. But I got this call out of the blue on Friday afternoon and he was pretty even tempered, muted in tone, and said the bill has been pulled. He just started piling on to the Democrats and trying to turn his attention to other issues. 

We'll talk a little bit more about that. But now he has turned his attention to the Republicans, less the Democrats in terms of what he said subsequently. What do you make of that? 

One of the most revealing moments in my conversation with the president was about when he said, I just didn't understand, Bob. He said, all this anger. I said, what do you mean by that? He said all the anger in the Republican Party, in the Congress. And what he meant was the Freedom Caucus, the group of hard-liners on the right and their contentious relationship with Speaker Paul Ryan, how the moderate Tuesday group in the House had their own uneasy relationship with the leadership. And he thought the party would be in lock step or at least willing to help him with a major legislative project like this early on in his presidency. But he said he, in a way, walked into a storm with all these simmering factional politics that have been playing out long before Donald Trump ever came on the political scene. Remember we've been talking for years about Speaker Boehner and then Speaker Ryan and all the upsets over government funding. And he is now face to face with that long-simmering drama. 

Yet at the end of the thing, you said to him to reflect on the lessons he learned, and he said what? 

He is not a reflective sort. I tried to pull him out, Charlie, in Charlie Rose style, please, reflect. This is a major moment, such a big crisis for you and your party. And he said flatly, "just another day in paradise." 

How do you think he views the experience that he has had the first 50 plus days? 

The way he talked about it was in a way he knows he's a non-ideological Republican. He doesn't come out of the Reagan movement like Speaker Ryan and so many other Republicans who think about themselves in visceral terms, at their core, as tax cutters, as people who want small government. Use that Grover Norquist phrase, put government in a bathtub and let it drown. I mean, a real hatred of the government. Trump doesn't have that. But he has embraced the ideology of Ryan because Ryan and McConnell in the Senate, the majority leader, they seem to understand how government works. And Trump is such a rookie at this in many ways on the scene. And so he's gone along with them. The question I have as a reporter, I'm sure many people do out in the country, is what now? It hasn't really worked to go along with Speaker Ryan on health care. Will he continue to go along with the Speaker and McConnell when it comes to taxes and infrastructure or maybe, will he listen more to Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, and take a more populist direction, work with Democrats? But of course the Democrats, Charlie, aren't exactly jumping at the chance to work with the president. 

So where does that leave him? 

It leaves him in a very difficult position, a new president who does not fully understand yet all the different power dynamics within his own party. A Democratic Party that's digging in in the same way Republicans did in the Obama era, still testy, many Democrats I speak to about the Obama era and how Republicans acted. And Trump has this challenge, 60 votes needed for most major pieces of legislation in the Senate. In the House, you're always gonna have this group of 20 to 40 members of the Freedom Caucus who really don't want to legislate at all unless it truly takes an ax to the federal government. What does Trump do? How does he navigate it? This is something that most presidents confront a little longer into their presidency. He has to deal with it now. 

One of the things that comes out of this and is certainly in terms of the Freedom Caucus, it is said they don't fear him. 

They don't. Because he has political capital. He's won and done well in many of their districts. But they are much more of the Ted Cruz wing of the Republican Party. The Texas senator and the Freedom Caucus were part of the government shutdown in 2013. They see the government is out of control. And they see themselves as movement activists. And in Trump, they like that he is anti-establishment, but when it comes to policy, they see an opening that he does not really have a policy blueprint he's trying to enact. And so Trump I think was befuddled when I talked to him about this in the sense that he thought he could win over the Freedom Caucus, that everyone in that group could be transactional. But in the real estate world, you can have transactional deals, but when you are dealing with idealogues, it is something very foreign to our president. He hasn't dealt with ideological purists and people who don't really want to have a transactional deal. 

Yes, he's been familiar with people, who -- it was once said, everybody has their price. 

Exactly. 

When you look at his relationship with Paul Ryan, I mean, he said very nice things to you about Paul Ryan. Clearly they worked hard on this. Clearly he was supposed to be the closer and couldn't make the deal, because of all the reasons you just said. Do you think he has any doubts about two things, first, his ability to close. Or does he simply blame the circumstances that he found himself in? 

He is not animated against Ryan in a personal way. I asked him repeatedly about Ryan trying to draw him out and see if there was anything there. And he said I don't blame Paul, I don't blame Paul. He kept repeating the phrase. But Trump and Speaker Ryan are kind of like a couple, you know, that everyone says it's fine. And you talk to them, they say it's fine. But all their friends are buzzing about the relationship and in not the best way. I mean, I talked to allies of Speaker Ryan, I talked to allies of President Trump over the weekend. And they're concerned. It is a complicated relationship. Both the President and the Speaker spoke over the weekend, talked through tax reform. But there's still not a lot of trust there according to the allies I've spoken to. Because they know Ryan turned against Trump in some respect during the campaign. And Trump is disappointed about health care. But he knows who else is there to work with? He can work with McConnell on some things. The Democrats aren't making overtures. So Ryan is what he has got. So he hasn't had a full scale revolt against Ryan but it was telling, Charlie, remember, he told everyone to watch Judge Jeannine's show. 

Yes, I know that. 

Jeannine Pirro. 

Who asked for Ryan's resignation? 

Who asked -- at the top of her show on Fox News for Ryan's resignation. And then the White House officials and Ryan spoke, people said nothing to see here. It was, he was just trying to promote a friend's show. That is the line, Charlie. But I will tell you, reporters around town, people at the White House behind the scenes, people are saying the president kind of knew what he was doing when he told people to watch her show. 

He knew that she was going to say that and therefore he wanted them to consider that question. 

If not explicitly knowing it, I've been told from some top sources that he at least knew the direction she was likely going to head. That she was frustrated on Trump's behalf whether she would take a knife to Ryan politically or not. Maybe he didn't know that. He didn't know what was in the script. The president is not Tweeting about every television show out there but he did Tweet about the one show that went after the Speaker. 

Breitbart News was very much opposed to Paul Ryan, correct? 

They are. And they used to be run by Steve Bannon. 

Right, of course. But where was Bannon? Was Bannon saying that to Trump and simply was overruled? Or was he in this case saying something else? 

Well, I call them the Bannonistas, I mean, the people at Breitbart who are Bannon's friends, and they are certainly against the Speaker and they are running a campaign against him on Breitbart almost daily. But inside the White House, Bannon is a little more intriguing because he's got to be careful and he has been careful. He hasn't mounted any campaign I'm told inside the White House against Ryan. And he told Ryan, they did have some tensions over strategy. Bannon went to the House on Thursday night last week and said look, I want a list of who was with Trump and who was against Trump on health care. And the leadership said we don't want a list like that, that makes us a little uncomfortable. And that's where they had a break. 

That's where what? 

That's where Ryan and Bannon had a break when it comes to strategy. Ryan didn't want to put his members on the floor to vote for a bill that would fail. Because that only leaves people -- You know Congress, Charlie. When a vote, everyone knows a vote is going to fail, you have votes fall even further on the floor, so you could have maybe only had 150 votes for the health care bill. 

So who talked the president into having made a statement that he wanted to put it out there and have people vote it down, if they did, so they would have Obamacare still exist, what convinced him not to do that? 

It was high drama. Thursday night Bannon goes to the House, says the president wants the vote, you all better vote for it. 

Right. 

This is it. Ultimatum. By Friday though, the Speaker goes to the White House. When the Speaker is going to the White House, everybody knew it was bad news for the bill but news hadn't broken. And he says to the president, and this is what the president told me, Speaker said, we don't have the votes, so you have a decision to make with me. What are we going to do? Ryan had talked it over with his members, he didn't want to have the vote. In a way they talked it through over the course of several minutes and they decided just to pull the bill and that's when I got the call. 

Where do they expect to go now? Do they expect to simply try to refashion a bill that might be able to get some Democratic votes? Do they want to refashion a bill that somehow can find common ground between moderates and the Freedom Caucus? Do they want to just simply take a breath and try to get tax reform? 

I think it's a little bit more of the latter, put it on a shelf for months, see where they can be in six months to a year, see if the Democrats are willing to work on any piecemeal legislation. It's hard for Republicans to give this up. They have been fighting against Obamacare for years. And today, Monday, the Speaker went on a conference call with his biggest donors and said, we are going to keep moving forward on health care this year in different ways. Don't worry, the fight is not over. So you're gonna see probably some legislation come up on different fronts. But this kind of wholesale overhaul of the health system, there's just not a consensus within the Republican Party in Congress. 

And will tax reform be compromised by what happened on Obamacare repeal and replace? 

Sure, I think so. I was talking to some congressmen today and they said look, tax reform is a big ambition. How is that going to happen? How are you going to get the votes for tax reform in terms of a lot of different things involved with cutting different deductions, getting rid of different subsidies and different rates for people. What is really more realistic I'm told from members of the House is some kind of tax rebate, minor tax cut plan that comes through the House, just so the president has some kind of tax plan, some tax cut he can tout. 

Corporate tax reform probably has a chance, doesn't it? 

It does, certainly. And they're not worried too much about all these tax cuts being paid for. Trump is not a deficit hawk. The Speaker is. But over the weekend, Mark Meadows, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus said in so many words that he would be willing to do tax reform without having it paid for with different kinds of deficit reduction offsets. So that means tax reform will likely move forward slowly. The question is, what is the number? Will there be a border adjustment tax? Will Trump have any kind of populist flash in the tax plan? 

Let's stop there. A border tax, a border tax, Ryan's for it, the president's against it. 

He is for it. Well, the president has said he wants tariffs. He would love to tax people at 30 percent coming in from Mexico and other countries. And so a border adjustment tax was included in the House Republican tax plan as a means of nodding towards the president's populism in his policies. But you got a lot of pressure from retailers like Walmart, on Senator Cotton of Arkansas, and those kind of situations where you've got a state, small states, poor states, with major retailers. They don't want a border adjustment tax. If they don't include the border adjustment tax or start tweaking it, tax reform loses some of its luster, it loses some of the money it could have as revenue to offset the cuts. It is a very complicated process. At the moment, again, just like with health care, there is no consensus. 

Speak to the question of those people who were very upset when they saw some of this bill who had been strong Trump supporters. And they believe they wanted a repeal and replacement of Obamacare, yet when they saw this, they were in a sense, they could feel the cutting edge of how it affected them, and they were very upset about that. 

That's what I wrote about a lot last week. And you look at the states Trump won, the Rust Belt, states that have real difficulties with opioid addiction, states that have high Medicaid populations like Ohio and Pennsylvania. You saw a real reservation about this Republican plan in the way it phased out the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. And people in Trump's base, some of Trump's closest friends like Christopher Ruddy, said to me, Trump is making a real mistake here. He is going in the Ryan direction. The reason Trump won the electoral college is because he won new states, states that had working class populations, some of them who really rely on Medicaid. And for his first act to be to phase out Medicaid, make major cuts to some aspects to health care, they thought that was cutting at Trump's political base, throwing them a punch unnecessarily. 

Trump now regrets going with Obamacare, going with repeal and replace? 

Well, that's the whisper around the White House. When I asked the president directly about that, he said no, I don't have any regrets. The president often publicly does not have any regrets, as we know. But some of the top allies say they wish in a way they could have done infrastructure first. Pulled in Democrats on something that it could mix with tax cuts and some spending. Because Trump is almost a Keynesian when he thinks about government and economics. And maybe he could have brought some more Democrats in early. But doing it in March and April after Gorsuch and after health care falls, it is a harder challenge. 

The president has insisted that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, will explode of its own nature. Do people in Washington and people that you know who are independent of political opinions on this believe that is going to happen? 

Well, there is some concerns that premium increases could lead to some kind of collapse in certain insurance exchanges and insurance markets. But Democrats tell me look, that's going to be fine because there will be Trumpcare then. The president stepped away from health care. I think Obamacare when you look how it plays across the country, there are states where it's doing better than in others. But you got to -- both parties know there has got to be changes made to it but no one is really willing to have a bipartisan coming together on that. 

And even Democrats who supported it and including some of the people I assume in the Obama White House who fashioned it, know that some of the things they said were going to happen, didn't happen. 

And if there is any president who can maybe wade into this and say I can work with Democrats, it's Trump because he is a former Democrat. He doesn't think like a Republican when it comes to health care policy. He railed against Obamacare as a political issue. And he said -- when I said to him -- I thought it was a very, again, revealing moment, when I said, you're maybe more natural negotiating with the Democrats down the line after all this explodes in your view. And he said, well, some people may say that, and he laughed. And so I think, he knows, deep down, maybe it is a political disaster for him the way this all unfolded, but he could negotiate with the Democrats at some point in the future. But if you are you Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and you are looking ahead to 2018, or you are Senator Warren or someone else who is maybe thinking about running in 2020, would you really want to work with President Trump on President Obama's signature law? That is a political hurdle Democrats are going to have to confront. 

We will leave it with that question. Robert Costa, thank you so much. 

Thank you. 

Back in a moment. Stay with us. President Trump suffered his first major legislative defeat on Friday. His signature campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare unraveled when Speaker Paul Ryan withdrew the GOP health care bill after failing to secure enough votes. Despite having majority in the House, the president and his team proved unable to bridge deep divisions within the Republican Party. Joining me now from Washington is Robert Draper. His new feature in "The New York Times" magazine is called "Trump Versus Congress: Now What?" I'm pleased to have Robert Draper back on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

How did this piece come about? 

Well, at the beginning of January, I had been talking, of course, to Trump along the campaign trail, getting a sense of what he would like to do. He had told me that the two things he wanted to do most of all were creating jobs and negotiating with foreign leaders. But he made a series of promises along the campaign trail, and I thought given that this is a man who is new to Washington, given as well that he has got a lot of unorthodox notions, he and his senior advisor, Steve Bannon, that kind of cut across party ideologies, given finally the fact that the Republicans hadn't been in charge for awhile and frankly, you know, when they controlled one part of the legislative branch, didn't govern so well, it was going to be interesting to see exactly how their legislative agenda rolled through. So I began kind of on a leisurely basis to interview people for the story, it began to pick up speed in March and as Obamacare began to implode, I interviewed a number of people in the Trump White House including the president himself. Then when the story or when the replacement actually did implode on Friday, we finished up the story and put it out on the web 48 hours later. 

That's what you call good timing, I think. 

I think so. It's better to be lucky than good. (LAUGHTER) 

So where do you think the president sees himself going now? 

Well, I think that he has convinced himself that it was never his idea to begin with, to repeal and replace Obamacare as his opening gambit. And I think that is, by the way, right, Charlie. I do think that a number of people had convinced him that this was going to be a chip shot. Something he could do in his first couple of weeks in office and move right on to things that were of greater interest to him. So I think that he is a bit disappointed that people led him astray. Paul Ryan, he is not throwing to the wolves just yet, but it's clear that Speaker Ryan is on probation. I think, frankly, the chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is as well. And for that matter, Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, this is supposed to be his baby, and it's not altogether clear what he did constructively to advance the ball. So the president is gonna turn the page, go on to tax reform. He is eager most of all, Charlie, to put up, as he puts it, a win. The problem all along has been what constitutes a win. He didn't have much of a vision for Obamacare and we'll see -- his vision is already shifting somewhat on tax reform. 

But he also has a new realization about the nature of Republicans in Congress. He may have thought that he had the ability to convince them of something that they ideologically weren't prepared to accept. 

That's right. I think that he came in figuring if he woos these guys,
