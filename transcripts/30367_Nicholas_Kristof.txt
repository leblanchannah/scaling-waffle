Tina Brown is here. She is a founder and CEO of Tina Brown Live Media. Last week, she hosted the 8th Annual Women in the World Summit here in New York. The three-day event featured women of impact and the men who championed them. This year's participants included Hillary Clinton, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Truedeau, and the president of Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards. Here's an excerpt from Hillary Clinton's interview with "New York Times" columnist Nicholas Kristof. 

What does it say about the challenges that one faces in women's empowerment, that in effect, misogyny won with a lot of women voters. 

Well, I am currently writing a book where I spend -- (CROWD CHEERING) I spend a lot of time wrestling with this. As you might guess, I've thought about it more than once. (LAUGHTER) And I don't know that there is one answer. Let's be clear. I think there -- you know in any campaign there are so many different cross currents and events and some have greater impact than others, but it is fair to say, as you just did, Nick, that certainly misogyny played a role. I mean, that just has to be admitted. And why and what the underlying reasons were is what I'm trying to parse out myself. 

Tina Brown also recently wrote an op-ed for the "New York Times" titled, "After a Historic March, What's Next for Women?" In it she writes, "Women who took steady, linear progress for granted are experiencing an unfamiliar and unsettling sensation -- a scary, wary feeling of real and present danger." I'm pleased to have Tina Brown back at this table. Welcome. 

Good to be here, Charlie. 

First about Women in the World Summit. Give me the sense of -- this was the eighth one. 

Yes. 

How has it changed? How is it different? 

Well, very interesting. This year, it was so muscular, so on fire because there was a real sense that this year it is so important here in the U.S. to get galvanized. Eight years ago when I started it, it was a tiny little summit in a small hotel, and since then it's exploded. At the time it was really about giving a platform to women all over the world who never have a chance to tell their stories so that we can actually understand the kind of challenges that they go through, which are in bold contrast very often to the challenges that we have to go through here -- how to get an education, honor killings, child marriage, all of these things which are so horrendous in many cultures that are very different from ours. Now what we're seeing, and the energy this year was much more about a muscular sense that things are changing here and it was like a great awakening in a sense so that the same people who had been coming year after year thinking how terrible it is over there in some other country are now thinking we have to protect our freedoms here. 

So in a sense becoming muscular because in a sense the resistance to the Trump administration has given -- 

Yes. 

-- has given a cause, an energy, a purpose? 

Definitely that, but also I think a tipping point, quite honestly, Charlie, because for years and years we keep hearing about the same old same old. You know, there have been women's meetings forever about, you know, equal pay, about sexual harassment, about protecting women's reproductive right. It's like, but now finally people are thinking, wait a minute, this is really getting old. It's really not changing. I mean, you know, obviously massive breakthroughs have happened, but look what's happened at Fox News. The sexual harassment is still completely rampant. You know, look what is happening, you know, at Uber. Look what's happening at Google where suddenly you find that the women are paid less than the men. You know, there were so many things that you kind of wonder what is it going to take to change? And then again, there is also a lot of new kind of feeling about being more tangible about protest. I mean, there was a wonderful discussion actually about advertising and about the constant objectification of women in ads, which is really vulgar, really demeaning very often, which just goes on. And Madonna Badger was on a panel with the head of P&G's marketing talking about how they're really campaigning to change the atmosphere around advertising so that actually you don't get the prizes and applauses for ads which make women really demeaned and debased. 

When you started this, you famously said, this is my inner journalist rather than my inner feminist. 

Absolutely. You know, when I think that this year the other great thing about Women in the World is it really consolidated us as a news organization because the world is as important for us as the women. This is really the news through the eyes of women. So that's why we did, for instance, the two amazing doctors who worked in Syria who I think came on to your show afterwards, remarkable heroes, and all the stories that we had -- 

in Syria. 

In Syria, all the stories that we had on the stage really were news and timely. Like we had the sexual harassment story, we had the Syria story, you know, we had the major -- 

You had Hillary Clinton. 

We had Hillary Clinton, we had the major newsmakers. You know, we had Justin Trudeau. 

Nikki Haley. 

Nikki Haley too, and she was -- memorably said, we don't do soft power, which was kind of a quote that's going to last a long time, I think. So, you know, I think that's the other great thing we've really shown, is that Women in the World is a news organization and that's exciting to me as a journalist because that's what I always wanted. 

When Hillary says there was misogyny, in part, do you think it was a significant contribution? 

She certainly admitted that there were multiple reasons why she lost this election and I mean Hillary would be the first to say and did say, you know, this is not just about misogyny. That would be giving herself a real free pass. But I think that everyone acknowledges and she acknowledged on the stage that there is no doubt about it that it is a way harsher light, you know, for a woman in the public eye. And she has proved that again and again. I mean, she's had 30 years really of being, you know, treated in that misogynistic way. And you know, the unforgiving light that a woman has when she runs is really still very chronic. I mean, you know, she talked about, which is absolutely true, that when she left the State Department, she had some 65 percent approval rating, but as soon as she become a candidate looking for power, grasping for power -- There is a real animus not just amongst men but amongst women for a woman who is seen to be grasping for power -- it becomes, you know, a threat. It becomes, you are ambitious in the wrong way. 

So what is attractive in men is considered somehow women unbecoming. 

That's right, and it's absolutely true with Hillary. In fact, Nicola Sturgeon, the wonderfully feisty First Minister of Scotland said exactly the same thing and she said watching the Hilary campaign, she was really dismayed at the kind of misogyny with which she was being attacked. I mean, that outrageous internet, you know, abuse, the trolling. Much of it as we now know of course from all kinds of hacking and Russian interventions, but it was pretty ugly to see. And what she said, Hillary, which I admired of course, she said, this kind of attack is meant to crush your spirit, and she said, I made them crazy because I would not be crushed. And you know, for that she will always be a tremendous, I think, role model to women because she had, as she said -- she said women who want to run, toughen your skin. You know, you are going to have to toughen up. And she is an absolute example of how someone has really have to toughen up in her life. 

Do you believe that Scotland will become independent? Because after Brexit there's already talk that Scotland will leave. 

It's very interesting. I mean, Sturgeon has been a passionate Scottish independence promoter from the moment she won. She lost the first referendum as we know, but it's certainly true that Scotland is now looking at it again because that is not what they voted to be a part of. They wanted to stay a part of Europe and, you know, they still want to stay part of Europe. And so they say now, listen, we voted to stay with the U.K. but only because we thought it was part of Europe, not now. So I think that there is going to be another major push for it. Whether she will win, I don't know. 

You're going to write -- you are writing your memoirs and maybe perhaps it's completed. It's about the "Vanity Fair" years. 

Well, it's actually my diary from those years. 

Oh, so you're just publishing a diary? 

You know, what I've done is, you know, it's very interesting, I went to my diary thinking this is going to be the fodder for the history of -- the'80s at the time -- that I lived through. 

So did I. 

And then I thought to read my diary. I had 250,000 words of journals which I kept all the way through "Vanity Fair," all the way through those eight and a half years in that pre, you know, iPhone era when we all had more time in the evening. And actually I realized that shaping it and re-editing it and adding to it and contextualizing it made a really sort of entertaining real-time gallop through this crazy time when I was editor at "Vanity Fair." At a time when, you know, the roaring '80s and the Reagan era and the whole kind of glitzy, crazy atmosphere of Conde Nast at that time, when Conde was a sort of Court of Louis the 14th and everything was like so, you know, lavish and excessive and stuffy. Look at now in the media and you think, how could this be? But it's very amusing now as a period piece -- 

But how was it then? Stressful? 

Then it was the voyage of a young woman who had arrived from London -- 

And "Vanity Fair" was in a bad place. 

Yes. "Vanity Fair" was in a very bad place. It was on its second editor in six months, and I was called in to sort of be the magazine doctor from London and I was, you know, just turned 30 and I had already, you know, turned around "Tatler" which had been bought by Conde Nast, so Si Newhouse said, let's bring in this, you know, young woman as our last hope. And it's a story really of a kind of battle to save "Vanity Fair" and also, my sort of adapting to the U.S. I mean, a lot of it is about my collision with New York and America and being completely baffled by everything. I mean, you know, it starts with me in a taxi on my way from Kennedy Airport into Manhattan, and I'm in the backseat and Dr. Ruth Westheimer is giving sex advice on the radio. 

Still is. 

And I have never, I mean, I was just completely -- absolutely gobsmacked. I mean, I never heard of anything, I was, what is this? What am I listening to? Get me out of this car. So it's really fun stuff. 

Yes. Let's talk about Harry for a moment because you have spoken about what he meant to you. I was touched by how you talked about Harry Evans, Sir Harry Evans. 

Sir Harry, the great Sir Harry. 

Who you married when you were very young. 

Yes, indeed. He is, of course, in my diary as my great sort of supporter all the way through and he's about to publish a wonderful book of his own in May called "Do I Make Myself Clear?" He's a great feminist, Harry. I mean, he would never sort of call himself a great feminist, but he is. He loves strong women. He loves strong women. And very often people have said to me, well, how does your husband feel? You're doing all these successful things. The answer is thrilled all the way through because he loves strong women, he likes -- 

So how did he contribute to your success in a sense other than you knowing he supported you and he was there for you? 

Right. 

That's a big part of it. 

Absolutely. Well, for starts, my professional mentor in every way. I mean, he absolutely taught me how to -- 

He was the king of London journalism. 

King of London journalism. He taught me how to write a caption. He taught me how to do a layout. I mean, he taught me, you know, what it was like to do -- how to crop a photograph. I mean literally, he was my tutorial all the way through. But also, he just -- he's just got great judgment. He's a fantastic journalist. He has a strong moral sense of what journalism is. He's always been my touchstone, you know, when I haven't known should I publish this or not, you know, he's always been the incredible judgment really there behind me. And just a passionate believer in me, if you like, you know, because my career has had its ups and downs and he's always -- and we have so many laughs. 

And I tell you what, I really quite enjoyed very much Tina Brown when she was so much younger. 

Let's talk about that. How did that start? She was working for you or? 

No, no, no. She went to Oxford when she was 16, and an agent, a famous literary agent called Pat Kavanagh who died fairly recently, sent me some clippings and said you should read these by this woman, they're in the "New Statesman" and "Private Eye" and they're very funny. Well, I didn't read them. Another sign of my neglect. I was too busy... And so I didn't read them. I read them one morning -- 

The "Crossman Diaries", everything. 

I read them one morning and I got so alarmed, they were so good and I let this stuff linger in my briefcase. So I finally called up -- this was the most hilarious -- I called the number and I said, could I speak to Tina Brown? Speaking, she said. Oh, I said, would you come into the office and see Mr. Ian Jack because we're very impressed with your articles. Could you come in today? I'm sorry, I can't come in today I'm giving dinner to my husband. I thought, husband? She's only 20. How precocious can you be? I said, are you Tina Brown? She said yes. I said, are you Tina Brown who just graduated from Oxford? She said, oh no, that's my daughter. (LAUGHTER) So, then of course when she came in and she was commissioned and she came to America and she met SJ Palmer and she met Theodore White and all these people and wrote marvelous articles for the "Sunday Times." 

Turn to the "New York Times," you wrote an op-ed that said, "What's next for women?" Has the movement, or whatever it is, stalled in your judgment? Is that the word you use, stall? 

Yes. I have no doubt that the women's movement had stalled until just recently, and I think -- 

And what's recently happened has given it new energy. 

Yes. I really believe that Hillary's loss motivated a huge surge in feminist energy in a way that clearly her run did not. 

OK, but was it because of Hillary's loss or because of Trump's victory? 

Both. But I do think women felt suddenly a kind of slap in the face, strong insult that in a sense -- 

And eminently qualified candidate. 

Yes. It was like the best woman in the view of many, had been beaten by the worst man. How did it come about that a woman who had been a senator, who had been a Secretary of State, who had been wildly qualified - 

The First Lady. 

-- First Lady, absolutely boned up, you know, really, you know, ready to go -- could be beaten by somebody who still hasn't filled half his positions. 

So what's your answer? 

Well, I think -- 

Your answer. 

My answer is, you know, multiple, but I think a kind of massive insecurity that took over and an ability for Trump, brilliantly, to communicate. I mean, there's no doubt about Trump that his tweeting and his ability to communicate and boil everything down to these slogans was tailor-made for the reality TV age. And you know, one of the issues that I always felt was that, you know, Trump had, you know, had a message and no strategy and Hillary had a strategy but didn't have a message in the sense that you could not boil down what Hillary stood for. 

That's partly true. 

I think she knew what she wanted to do but it never became -- 

There was no narrative. 

There was no narrative. 

-- very strong narrative that said -- 

No narrative. 

-- this is what it's about. 

But I also think that, you know, you have to be -- unfortunately, I mean, you've just got to be entertaining these days in order to win. I think that if you are running for office, forget it if you can't be an entertainer because in today's era where attention spans are so short, you have to be able to get the people, you know, you have to get people to watch. You have to get people to pay attention. 

And boy, did Trump do that. 

What is really interesting about Trump, too, is that he really is himself, if you're like a low information voter. I mean, what we see in Trump is the result of 20 years of imbibing and absorbing Fox News. 

Right. 

It's true that Trump and his audience have eaten the same kind of toxic diet, if you like, in which they've all convinced themselves of this delusional other world that's going on in which there is blood in the streets and marauding Mexicans and, you know, all of these outdated views about what China is doing to them. So, it's all coming out of a kind of toxic media diet, and I believe that Trump truly believes everything that he says in that regard because that's what he's feasted on all of these years. 

What do you think of the Syria decision for the airstrike? 

I think that was a good decision. I'm sure he was horrified by the images, but I don't think that's really what it is, I mean, I -- 

Do you think he had a strategy, I mean, he had a plan? 

I think, myself, that Mattis and McMaster and, you know, the people who really know their stuff have wanted to do this for some time. I think there was great dismay amongst the national security community for a long time about the inaction in Syria. 

On the part of Obama? 

On the part of Obama. And I think that feeling had really built up and I think that, you know, Trump doesn't really have a strategy, I don't think. I think it's all about pushing the right buttons at the right time. 

As someone said, one airstrike does not make a strategy. 

Right. It does not and I think that's what is -- I hope it's not about seeing photographs only of killed babies. I mean, I don't think one should be cerebral about everything. I think there are many things that are just unacceptable and I think the worst thing is to announce that something's not acceptable and then do nothing about it. So, I was absolutely in favor of that strike. I mean, I do want to feel though that there's strategy going forward because simply being emotive, having a strike, and then not talking about it again isn't a strategy. 

He has not yet spoken. 

Not yet. 

You know, I mean, it's interesting. I don't know why that is. 

It's mysterious. (LAUGHTER) But I think we've all spent a lot of time trying to parse out what he means. 

Come back when you finish the memoir. 

Thank you so much, Charlie. 

Great to see you.
