We turn now to a battle being waged in Arkansas over the death penalty. Earlier today, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by the Arkansas attorney general to carry out the first of eight planned executions by the end of the month. The decision comes after a week of last-minute appeals, state and federal debates over lethal injection drugs, and continued questions about the ethics of capital punishment. Hundreds of anti-death penalty advocates converged on Little Rock on Friday, to call on Governor Asa Hutchinson to halt the planned executions. Hutchinson has said that he scheduled the back-to-back executions before the state stock of a lethal injection drug expires. Joining me now to discuss this important issue are Damien Echols, a member of the so-called West Memphis Three. He spent 18 years in prison on death row after being wrongly convicted of murder. He was released in 2011. Lorri Davis, she began a correspondence with Echols while he was in prison and is now an anti-death penalty advocate. And David Boies, he's a founding partner of the law firm Boies, Shiller, and Flexner, and has spent a lot of time on this issue in particular. I'm pleased to welcome all of them to this table. Thank you for being here. Damien, I want to start with you. We mentioned 18 years on death row. You know all of the men currently scheduled for execution right now. 

Yes. 

When this all came up, you went to Little Rock last week. 

I did. 

When this all first cropped back up again, what were your thoughts? 

I was horrified. We got a call from the woman that runs the Arkansas coalition to abolish the death penalty, and she told Lorri that they were having a gathering there to, you know, protesting executions and they asked if I would come there, and my first thought was merely no. You know, it was a nightmare for me. I think it was probably -- I was thinking it would probably be one of, probably the second most traumatic thing to ever happen to me in my life, to have to return back there to where people tried to kill me. You know, second after actually being sent to death row. But the more I thought about it, I couldn't sleep at night because I was thinking I can't just sit here and not raise a hand, not try to do anything while they're killing these guys. But even after I made that decision, I'd go back and forth. You know, I would say, I've got to do this. There's no way -- I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I don't do this. But when I get ready to go to bed that night, I would wake up having panic attacks and feeling like I was having a heart attack and being unable to breathe and I would tell Lorri I can't do it, I can't go. So I would go back and forth all the way up until probably the very last minute, and I just knew this was something I had to do, but it was still trying and horrific. 

Because this was the first real sort of substantial visit back for you where you had to talk to folks and maybe see some of the folks who you hadn't seen in so long. 

Absolutely. And, you know, this was one of those things where the thing that kept going through my mind is these people tried to murder me for something I didn't do. These people knew that I didn't do this. After DNA testing came out in my case, I still sat on death row for two more years while the state tried to figure out how they could still kill me and sweep this under the rug and not have to admit they made a mistake. So all I'm thinking, I'm going back into this place where these people were more than willing to murder me and not lose a night's sleep over it. And I kept thinking over and over, what if they do something else? What if they try to send me back again? So that's what I had to get through. That was what I was wrestling with in an attempt to return to the state. 

I want to talk about more about your back story and what happened to you starting in the early '90s in a moment, but first, I want to talk about what's happening right now and what you were there to talk about on Friday, Don Davis in particular. He's the one scheduled right now, the subject of discussion right now. You knew Don Davis very well. Tell me about him. 

I knew Don for the entire time that I was in prison. He got there before I did, so I knew him for about 18 years. In prison, you don't really develop friendships the way you do in the outside world. The best thing you can hope for is you establish an understanding with someone that, no matter what happens, I'll watch your back and you watch my back. We're going to look out for each other no matter what's taking place. And for me Don Davis was that person. There were times in there that I honestly do not think I would have survived in prison, I would not be sitting here now if not for him looking out for me. So, you know, for other people, for people who are pro-death penalty, these guys are stories they read in the newspaper, things they saw on television. For me, these are flesh and blood people that I lived with for almost 20 years. 

We should mention, Don Davis freely admits his guilt. 

Absolutely. 

Says it was a terrible thing he did. I think he said even if they would have executed him the day after, he would have felt like it was a just execution. He killed a woman in the process of a home invasion. The family of the victim is upset right now. They want this to happen. They're frustrated by further delays. What do you say to them? 

Well, I would say I understand your pain, you know, first and foremost. I don't want to downplay any sort of trauma or anything else that you're going through. I understand it completely. And I understand that desire for vengeance. You know, keep in mind I had people try to murder me. I would like to see the people who did that to me held accountable. I would like to see them be held responsible for what they did to me. But, at the same time, I don't believe that death is ever the answer to anything. And I think you also have to keep in mind that this system is run by human beings. Human beings are fallible. They make mistakes. And when you cast a net this wide and you start executing this many people, starting up what in essence is a conveyor belt of death, you're going to catch innocent people in that net and innocent people are going to die along with the guilty ones, and I don't think that executing the innocent is ever going to ease anyone's pain. 

David, I want to talk about the death penalty. The number of executions has been down. Asa Hutchinson says he has to do this now or wants to do this now because the stock of the drug that they use is going to run out. First of all, why is that running out? Why is the governor doing it at this time? 

I think one of the reasons the drug is running out is that fewer and fewer companies want to be participating in the death process. There are obviously two important problems with the death penalty. One is whether the state, whether the people, whether society ought to be putting anybody to death. The second is that, as this clearly illustrates, the death penalty is applied to a lot of innocent people, and there is nothing that you can think of that society can do that is more troubling than consciously putting to death somebody and then having that person be innocent, and I think that the fallibility of our criminal justice system and the discrimination that poor people, people of color, disadvantaged people face in our criminal justice system is something that ought to give everybody pause about the death penalty. 

Lorri, can I ask you about midazolam a little bit, this is the drug in question that we're talking about that the governor says they're going to run out of. David mentions these drug companies don't want to be in this business... What is it intended for? 

The drug itself isn't an analgesic. It is -- actually the reason it exists is to calm people down so that they are in a relaxed state. So it doesn't prohibit an extremely painful situation when someone has the needle put into their arm and, in many cases, it's caused a great deal of pain on these botched executions when men are lying on the table, gasping for breath. It is said that this death is one of the most painful deaths because they feel as if they're burning up from the inside, literally burning, and this drug doesn't prohibit that pain. And it's a big problem, also, because in Arkansas' case they've cloaked their procedure, so you can't FOI, you know, the general public has no knowledge of how this drug is being administered. It can be just a department of correction employee who's doing it and, in many cases, it's not even a medical doctor because medical doctors, same as the drug companies, aren't interested in killing people. So it's a big problem because people don't know how to administer it. It's not doing what people think it's supposed to do, prohibiting the pain. It's a problem. 

If I could add something. 

Go ahead. 

Keep in mind also, these drugs were never meant to be used to kill people. That's not what they were designed. These were designed by companies to help people, people with ailments, people with sicknesses, people who need surgery, whatever it is. That's what they were designed for. So the state tries to convey this image to the general public that it's sort of like putting an animal to sleep, that the person goes to sleep and they feel no pain and it's over. There are cases where they had to give men they were executing up to 15 doses of this medicine to knock them out and it still took them over two hours to die. They laid on the table gasping, coughing, and twitching for two hours after receiving 15 doses of this medication. 

Lorri, you began correspondence with Damien while he was in prison. 

I did. 

The correspondence picked up, you eventually married. We talked about going back to Arkansas, and I know it was not easy for him, it wasn't easy for you, when all of this happened last week. Why do you think that was so important and what impact do you think it's had? 

I think it was important -- well, speaking for Damien, I think it's important just because he knew all of these men. And like his story about Don Davis, it's hard for him to just turn his back and not do something. I think it was important for everyone to appear at this rally because it's the only thing that the state of Arkansas reacts to, is pressure, being seen. They've been able to do executions. They've been able to convict innocent men for years. It's a very insular place. I lived there for 16 years, I saw the way they conducted their business. The only thing they react to is pressure from the outside, media intervention. So getting the word out to as many people as possible about what they're doing is the only thing that makes a difference. 

And legal intervention. So, David, talk a little bit more about where this case stands and where other germane death penalty cases may stand around the country right now. 

Well, each case is a little bit different. And, indeed, some of the cases in Arkansas right now are different. Some people are claiming innocence. Some people are claiming mental -- a level of mental awareness that makes it inappropriate to put them to death. Some of them are simply opposed to the death penalty under any circumstances. So each case is different. But what you see is a series of legal challenges to the death penalty. Some of them proceed on the argument that any imposition of the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment, violative of the constitution. Some of them proceed on the basis that from a legislative standpoint, legislators should not make the decision to put people to death. On the other hand, there are a number of people who can oppose the death penalty right now who believe that, if you had a perfect system, there are crimes that deserve the death penalty. The problem is that we don't have a perfect system, and what we do is we convict innocent people. We don't have an all-seeing judge that can understand what the truth is. We have imperfect judges and imperfect juries and we have imperfect lawyers, and what happens is that the vulnerable, the disadvantaged, the poor, the discriminated against, they get the worst lawyers, they have the greatest suspicion. The statistics show they are the most likely people to get put to death, and that is a problem independent of what your views are about capital punishment in theory. 

Right, so if the drug companies and the medical professionals don't want to be involved in this, regardless of the moral debate here, if the drug companies and the medical professionals don't want to be involved in this, it makes the state's job increasingly more difficult, which leads you to wonder why they are continuing to pursue it and how often it's being pursued right now. 

It's not being pursued nearly as much now as it has been in the past. In part for those reasons, and in part for the reasons that I was saying before about doubts, about both the efficacy, the morality, and the fairness of the death penalty. But there are a number of people on death row right now, and as a society, keeping them there in this kind of limbo is not the right thing to do either. We have to make decisions as a society, as to what kind of society we're going to be. And part of that is, I think, facing up to the reality that whatever the theoretical desirability a death penalty might be, if we had a perfect system, we don't, we won't have, we probably can't have, and under those circumstances, I think people would have to reexamine how many innocent people are we prepared to put to death in order to get vengeance on certain guilty ones. 

Damien, if you could, take me back to West Memphis, Arkansas, in 1993. There was a grizzly murder of three young boys, eight years old, best of friends. What happened, how did the authorities come to turn their attention to you and what happened next? 

In 1993, which is the year that I was arrested, you know, I lived in this very small town called West Memphis, Arkansas. It was an extremely conservative, fundamentalist, you know, hard-core Christian. So I really did not fit-in in this neighborhood. You know, they considered me suspicious just because the way I looked in the first place, and that was a lot of what they used as evidence against me at the time of the trial. They said, you know, I listened to heavy metal music, and I had books by Stephen King, and I dressed in black, so, therefore, these things, in their minds, proved I was a Satanist. And, in their minds, it would have taken a Satanist to have committed these crimes. So I went to death row for years. Keep in mind, in 1993, they could not do the same sort of DNA testing that they can do now. The technology has come a long way just in those years. So when they could finally do the DNA testing, they found that not only did the DNA at the crime scene not match me or the other two men that they had convicted of it, instead, it matched one of the victim's family members. We've also had three eyewitnesses come forth who said that they saw the same person the DNA matched with all three of the victims within an hour of the time they were murdered. These people were never even talked to by the police at the time of the murders, even though they lived right there in very close proximity to the victims. No one ever even questioned them and asked them if they saw anything. So, in essence, what happened was the police picked up a mentally handicapped child, a mentally handicapped kid in my neighborhood, he was 17 years old, but he operated more along the intellectual level of an eight to ten year old, and over a period of somewhere from 12 to 14 hours, they tortured and battered a confession out of this guy. They couldn't actually get any of the details of the crime scene right because he wasn't there, but they didn't care. It didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was the fact that they got him to say, yes, he did it, and he implicated me and the other two men. You know, like I've said a while ago, even after the DNA came to light, even after the new eyewitnesses came forth, people in society had this idea because of all the shows they watch on TV that, oh, you had DNA in this case, so the person -- it's over. The person is going to go home. That's not necessarily true. That's only 50 percent of the battle. You can have all the evidence in the world pointing toward your innocence and they will still kill you and sweep it under the rug unless the outside world is paying attention. That's the other 50 percent of the battle, getting people out here to care, getting people to notice what's going on. 

You believe they basically thought of you as the odd kid in school. 

The freak, yes. 

And said, listen, we're looking for something, for a reason to do something like this to you? 

One of the police, as soon as they found the bodies, even as they were -- the bodies were found in a very wooded area, submerged in water. Even as they were taking the bodies out of the water, one of the police later said, he said as soon as they found the bodies, well, it looks like Damien Echols finally did it. 

And this is because you listened to Metallica, you didn't act like everyone else in town? 

Exactly, read Stephen King novels. I always, you know, ever since I was really young, really, really loved western esotericism, ceremonial magic, things of that nature. In their minds, anything that's not fundamentalist Christian is automatically Satanic. So that made me -- it put a bull's-eye on my back in this small community. 

Because they said these were occult killings. 

Exactly. Exactly. It was during the time in the early '90s and late '80s, you had this thing going across the country that they now call in hindsight, Satanic panic, where you had, you know, it wasn't just me, you had people all over this country sitting in prison because they were accused of -- They were saying at one time, you know, you had huge shows like Geraldo Rivera and Oprah Winfrey. They were doing shows on this topic, which we now know didn't even exist. They were saying as many as hundreds of thousands of human sacrifices were taking place across the country every year. They had no evidence to support this. No bodies were ever found to support any of this. But it was still like accepted as gospel, not only in Arkansas at that time, but throughout the country. 

Tell me a little more about your time in prison. I know that it damaged your eyesight badly which is why you are wearing shades. 

Yes. 

Where -- where did you spend your time? You began writing a book at some point. 

Yes. 

This affected you in different ways as you spent more time in prison. Talk about that a little bit. 

Well, it affects you physically on a bunch of levels, a bunch of different levels. Keep in mind that, you know, I was in prison for almost 20 years and the last eight years of that I was in solitary confinement, 24 hours a day. I didn't see sunlight for almost a decade, which is part of what started destroying my vision. I had, you know, just a list of health problems whenever I got out because there is almost no medical care, no dental care, things like that. They're not going to spend a lot of time, money, and energy taking care of someone they plan on killing. So, whenever I got out, I had a long road just trying to get my health back up to normal. The thing I think that helped me survive in there, that kept me from losing my sanity, was, you have to build a life for yourself. As hard as that is inside those walls, you have to find something to focus on other than the prison or you're going to go insane. And for me, those things were meditation, energy work, and Lorri. You know, over the years, I had a Zen master that would come back and forth from Japan to the prison. And before I got out, I even received ordination in tradition of Japanese Buddhism, which was the same tradition they used to train the samurai in Japan. By the time I got out, I was hitting up to eight hours of meditation a day. A lot of times as crazy as it sounds, I wouldn't even think about the walls around me. I was thinking about the books that Lorri and I were reading together or the conversations we were having when we are allowed to see each other once a week or the 15-minute phone call that we had that morning. So for me, it created a world that I was able to live in that gave me enough of a buffer zone from the prison that it didn't completely and absolutely break me inside the way it would have otherwise. 

Though it did its best. 

Yes, absolutely. And it came close many, many times to absolutely destroying me. Even when I got out, people think that you're just gonna be happy and excited that you're out of prison and you are on a certain level, but you're also completely crippled. Keep in mind that when I walked out of prison after almost 20 years, the last time I had seen a computer was 1986. And it was basically a glorified typewriter for rich people. You know, it wasn't connected to the internet, none of that sort of thing. I walked out into a world -- I went from almost a decade of solitary confinement to the streets of Manhattan literally overnight. So I walked out into a world where everyone uses computers. Everyone uses ATM machines and debit card readers and all these things that I had no idea how to use. So for me, it was almost like being an alien dropped off in a completely new world and expected to just find my way without any instruction, any help, anything. I needed -- it devastated me to the point that I needed someone with me 24 hours a day, seven days a week, almost as if I were an invalid. As bizarre as it sounds, I can barely remember my first year out of prison, just because I was so psychologically devastated that it destroyed something in me. When I was in prison, I was a voracious reader. I would read up to five books a week. When I got out of prison, suddenly I could no longer read. I would try to read the same page over and over and over and could not retain what I was reading when I got to the bottom of the page. I couldn't watch movies. I couldn't watch television. I would introduce myself to the same person two or three times because I couldn't even remember having met them before even if I had dinner with them the night previously. It destroyed me in ways that took me years to start recovering from. I would say that I've only started to become ev
