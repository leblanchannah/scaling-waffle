strong corporate earnings calmed the anxious middle class somewhat and emboldened Americans to get into equities. This year, after months of 3% growth and the Dow breaking 7,000 last month, some wondered, "Can it last?" Yesterday's quarter point interest rate hiked by the Federal Reserve was a preempted pullback. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has been signaling since December. Joining me now from Washington, Lawrence Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; here in New York, economist Henry Kaufman, and John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. Welcome all. Larry Summers, let me begin with you. The New York Times today said, "The general Wall Street view is that the economy and the stock and bond markets can't escape this round of credit tightening without major damage, but that could change if the Federal Reserve proves to be more determined to raise rates than most now expect, or if the Japanese were to join in raising rates." Do you agree with that? 

Well, I don't make prescriptions to the Federal Reserve, but I think this is a very robust economy. The energy of what the private sector in this country has done in recent years, the progress we've made in bringing down the budget deficit, creates a situation where we've got something we haven't had in a long time, an investment-led, low-inflation recovery with strong export performance. We haven't had a combination like that since the early 1960s. I think that suggests a lot of the robustness. One has to be tremendously encouraged by the fact that the economy can be this strong with this much demand and pressure without any real evidence of increasing inflation. I think it's a tribute to flexibility of the American private sector, but also to sound policy here, bringing down the budget deficit, our respect for the independence -- 

Tell me what you think, Henry, about this action by the Federal Reserve. 

I think this is the first expression of some concern about the emerging economic and financial situation. Among other things, we're much closer to a full utilization of resources, the unemployment rate is low, the number of people employed is rising here. We have had a considerable amount of exuberance in the financial market. There's a huge amount of liquidities still there. This has to be considered as the first of a number of tightening actions that is going to come along. We are not where we were five, six years ago. 

Okay, but is Kaufman where Greenspan is and where Buffet is basically saying these stock equity prices are just too damn high when you consider the fundamentals? 

I am close to that, but let me explain. I think the stock market today as a result of these actions suggest that there is a soft ceiling, but not a cement ceiling. That soft ceiling we may go up again and hit it, then go up a little bit more, but from here on, any significant rise in equity prices above current levels is going to be continually considered irrational exuberance. 

To use the phrase of Greenspan. What do you think? 

Well, if the question is what's going to happen to the stock market -- 

Well, the question is whether this be approved would be -- did you cheerlead this action by the Federal Reserve? 

I think it was appropriate. The US economy has performed extremely well since the end of the Gulf War recession. We've had an extended period of growth and for the past few years, it's been notable for the small deviations from full employment, despite falling inflation, falling inflation expectations and very strong growth in corporate earnings. It seems that the last few months have brought a renewed surge of demand growth, at least as portrayed in the data. I think the Federal Reserve, even though by many historical measures of its policies is already following quite appropriate policies, I think, needed to take out some insurance to make sure that we weren't going to see a rise in inflation pressures for the first time since the beginning of 1980s. 

I think I heard Mr. Kaufman say that this was a first of a series you expect. 

Exactly. 

Is that what you expect? 

Yes, I do. 

Over a period of six months or a period of -- 

No, I don't think so. I think Mr. Greenspan in his recent congressional testimony has suggested that unless growth show signs of moderating, unless demand growth has shown signs of moderating, that the Fed will continue to be worried about the emergence of inflation pressures and imbalances. That suggests to me that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates until there is a sign of some slowdown, and I don't expect to see that. 

I want to get back to Larry Summers in a second, but do both of you feel very good about the direction of the American economy and the elements that are at play? 

I think the direction of the American economy from a pure economic viewpoint, not financial, I think is doing exceedingly well, low inventories, good capital expenditures at the present time, consumer is doing their part-- 

Stronger earning? 

-- strong earnings. That's fine, but there are a number of factors. One of them is an external factor that, at some point in time will come in here to hurt or to (inaudible) the American economy in the financial markets and this depends on the speed of economic expansion in Europe and Japan. As long as that is moderate, not very significant, we are going to be in a competitive situation and we can pull in all that liquidity that is excess in Europe and in Japan to finance a good part of our economic growth. 

Larry, can I at least get you to venture off into the world and how you think the world is doing and since we put the Fed off limits? 

Sure, Charlie. I think Henry makes a very important point when he emphasizes the importance of growth in Europe and in Japan. The financial aspect that he refers to is one, a different aspect I think is very important is what it means for our trading position. Because more rapid growth in Europe, more rapid growth in Japan, will mean more rapid growth in the demand for US exports, which will mean a reduction of the trade balance relative to what otherwise be there, and a lower trade balance surely would increase the overall health of the economy, so I think it's important that we see more growth in Europe and in Japan. We've been expressing our concerns for some time about Japan and about the dangerous possibility that the Japanese current account, the surplus would expand substantially if they don't ensure that uncertain way their economy will go, but if it's necessary, they don't ensure that they take the steps that are necessary, particularly through fiscal policy to ensure that there is adequate growth that is led by their domestic demand, by their own consumers and by their own investors. At the same time, I think in Europe, we've all got a stake in seeing adequate growth in Europe because a growing prosperous Europe will be a better trading partner for us. It'll be a better partner for us in addressing global problems. We have to be very concerned that Europe take the steps that are necessary to create the kind of flexibilities that will enable their economy to grow and that as they move forward with the monetary union project, that they remember that ultimately its success and their economic success depends upon the attainment of a reasonable rate of growth. 

Let me come back to (inaudible). 

You see, here is where Larry and I differ. Larry speaks from the position of the global situation. I'm speaking from the position of the United States. In a narrowly defined way, the American economic expansion here has been orderly, has been on a non-inflationary path, in part because Europe and Japan have had very little growth. Would they have had very significant growth, then the pressure on prices in terms of goods and services would have been far greater. Since our savings rate is relatively low, we couldn't have financed some of our economic expansion. It's true, the budget deficit is coming down, but considering that we're at full employment, we shouldn't have any budget deficit. 

Let me get you in here, John. 

Well, that's great, I get to be in a happy situation of agreeing with both of these fine gentlemen. I do agree with Larry Summers, certainly. It's in our long-term interest to see good performance in our major trading partners, rather than the sluggish performance that we've seen and the kind of imbalances that have emerged in Europe and Japan can't be in our long-term interest. At the same time, when they do start growing, the challenges for maintaining good balance, the challenge for policymakers to maintain good balance in the US to continue to bring down inflation because inflation by my standards is still too high, the budget deficit is still too high after six years of uninterrupted expansion in the US. We've got progress we need to make and when the rest of the world is growing more strongly, it's not going to be as easy. 

All things considered, I would suggest to you that American businesses and American workers will be better off if Europe and Japan grow more rapidly. Yes, it will require some adjustments in financial markets, but I think it's very much in our interest for those economies to be growing more rapidly. 

You're shaking your head. 

I think under those conditions, more rapid growth in Europe, more rapid growth in Japan, I think this will put enormous pressure eventually on American financial markets, particularly on the fixed income markets. When that occurs, fixed income obligations will become far more competitive with the equity market and it will not only put a ceiling on equity prices, but it'll put down with pressure on them. 

Let me come back to the domestic economy. The Business Week Magazine has a story on their cover this week called The New Business Cycle. "It used to be housing and autos, but the economic expansion of the '90s have been fueled by the strong growth of the information technology industry. There's a danger. High-tech slowdown could drag down the economy and the stock market." Is that what we're going to see? 

Well, it seems likely that we're going to see some slowdown in the strength of business investment that has been enormously strong over the past couple of years. We have seen a progressive slowdown over the past couple of years in operating profits of American industry. I think it's reasonable to expect that that will continue and that will bring a slowdown in investment and in the high-tech area that will tend to moderate growth in the US economy. But that's not necessarily bad and it's portrayed in that article as perhaps the trigger for a new downturn or an outright recession. Well these things can happen and it's a risk but some moderation in the economy's performance, as long as it maintained good balance and sustained growth wouldn't be so terrible.(crosstalk) 

Do I hear-- 

I think it's worth saying, Charlie as the economy moves towards services, information technology becomes important. We've now been 15 years with 1 recession that while serious, was really mild compared to the recessions that we had '82, '75 and the mid 1950's. I think what one has to contemplate, you can't get Euphoric, the business cycles not over; one does have to contemplate that some of these structural changes in the economy towards more flexibility, better services, more inventory control, more internationalization may well have attenuated a bit the volatility of the business cycle. 

Let me just throw out an unrelated question. One of the great stories of last year, late 1995, that got much attention, primarily because AT&T was downsizing. Is that over? 

Not at all. If the issue means are we going to -- Are corporations still under pressure to increase their efficiency, to control their production costs, I think that's very true. I recently attended at meeting of producers in the metals and mining industry, an area where you think you would have seen a lot of restructure in the 1980's and in fact you did. Those representatives of those companies uniformly have the opinion, they don't know where prices are going, their job is to continue to shrink out costs of production and they remain confident. 

That's primarily workers? 

Not necessarily. 

No? 

Not necessarily, shedding workers but increasing productivity through investment. Does that mean that we're likely to be able to maintain good growth without putting -- Good economic growth without putting undo strains on the labor market, I think that's a good thing. 

Actually, downsizing is being encouraged by the financial markets indirectly because we are still seeing a large wave of mergers and mergers these days, produce cutting back components of the new combined entity. We see that (crosstalk) that this gentleman just joined. 

You mean Chemical and Chase. 

Yes, for example. 

Just to pick an example. 

Charlie I think you have to put downsizings in the perspective of upsizings (crosstalk) There's 11 and a half million more people working than there was 4 years ago. Why? Our economy changes and as it changes it creates opportunities and that creates employment opportunities and "firm expands by 2%, firm opens new plant," you don't see kinds of stories in the newspapers. The miraculous feature of the American economy has been just how many upsizings there have been. 

Yeah. 

The growth of firms have been. That's why we created all these jobs, I think that's what we've got to work to try to keep going. 

You think that's an untold story of the Clinton Administrate job creation? 

I think I'm probably not the first to run (crosstalk) Charlie, I'd be happy to expand at greater length if that would be helpful. 

I got the point. I think I got the point. Does the fact that the Speaker Gingrich said that he is prepared to take taxes off the table, we're cutting taxes off the table right now in order to get a balanced budget for us so good, everybody can know what they're dealing with. That make any difference at all? 

To me it does. I think at the present time with the economy moving ahead as well as it is the high utilization of labor, land, equipment and so on. This is not the moment to talk about the tax cuts. 

So you're happy to see not to see any serious reduction in taxes. 

We should not have the deficit right now considering the pace of economic development. 

Balance the budget and take care of taxes later. 

Right. 

Yep. John. 

Lets not lose sight (crosstalk) of the big issue here. In the long run, how you balance the budget, which everyone seems to now have agreed is a good goal. How you go about doing it does have an impact on economic performance, it's not equivalent in economic terms to balance the budget by raising taxes or balance it by controlling spending and lowering taxes. I think that -- It seems to me that tax reform is an area in which it is going to be possible to achieve even greater efficiencies in the U.S. economy and I hope over the medium term, not to say right this second but that the balances -- That the budget is balanced through, among other things, improvements and lowering of taxes 

This is -- You're closer to what Jack Kemp has been saying in the last couple weeks? 

I think that you'll find an awful lot (crosstalk) I think you will find that a lot of economists will agree with the notion that -- 

Sure. 

You can -- 

Okay Larry I got it. Go ahead. 

Charlie, I think that it's worth looking at the budget that the President has proposed, it continues to trend, it's reduced the workforce federal government by 250 thousand, it moves towards balance, at the same time I'd give some useful forms of tax relief. Particularly support for families as they send their kids of to college, expansions of IRA so that people have more of incentive to save because getting that national savings rate up is very important for people as they retire and its very important for the economy as well. I think we can give people some dividend from the progress that we're making, in the form of modest tax cuts while at the same time moving -- 

Modest tax cuts and where? 

Modest tax cuts, where? In the areas that the President has talked about that are very important. Getting more kids to go to college, providing a basic junior college, tuition for almost all families, supporting 

Okay, last question here at the table in New York. What's your recommendation to your clients today about where their investments ought to be? Both in terms of equity, debt, liquidity. 

I think for the average American today, if you expect higher interest rates, as I do. I think I would buy 2 year Treasury obligations which yield about 6 and 3/8 percent. There's no credit risk. Today they risk for buying high yielding obligations is quite high, spreads are narrow. Number 2, you have to be very selective in where you go in the equity market here and in terms of liquidity, you really are not being paid to take significant credit risks at the present time. 

Okay. John. 

I agree with that for the near term. I would like to put on the table, I remain optimistic in the following sense, important sense. Right now most people find it hard to believe that inflation in the U.S. is going to fall below 3 percent in the next few years. I think that's not only possible, I think it's also desirable and I think there is a good chance that that is going to happen. In fact I would say right now, most people are too pessimistic on the inflation outlook. My guess is that we are going to produce over the next few years, a very favorable inflation and investment outlook. 

Just 1 answer Larry. What do you think at the end of 1997 will be the economic growth rate? 

I think we're going to continue to be steady as we go, fluctuation quarter to quarter between 2 and 3 percent. 

Between 2 and 3? 

Yep. 

Thank you very much, pleasure all of you.
