Frank Langella is here. Known by most American audiences for roles in such film as Dracula, Dave and Eddie, he has been very successful on the stage, too. He earned a Tony Award for his 1975 Broadway debut in Edward Albee's Seascape. He went on to garner acclaim for his roles in Amadeus, Hurly-Burly and last season's big hit, Present Laughter. He is currently starring in his own adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac, which he also directs. And he is a friend and I am pleased to have him back at this table. Thank you for coming. FRANK LANGELLA, Actor/Director: Thanks, Charlie, very much. This closes down this weekend? 

Sunday. 

Tell me about the experience of doing this, why you wanted to do it, what have you-- has it been good for you? 

Well, what comes to mind, actually, is a line from the play, ''Because I am a fool, stupid enough to hang myself.'' I wanted to do it because I had a notion that unrequited love is something so universal and so timeless and so painful to every single human being that I could possibly find a way to do it differently in Cyrano and I think I've had intermittent success with it. My notion was that if I could take Cyrano out of his time and his place, if I could remove all of the frills and the white plumes and the crowds and the enormous battle scenes, and bring it to a simple triangle-- one man is in love with a woman who doesn't love him, she loves somebody else. I don't think there's any of us who doesn't know that. So I took the play and I shortened it by about an hour and I took away the idea of cavalier times and costumes. And it has been for me the most extraordinary experience of my life, for all kinds of reasons. 

Like? 

Well, because I messed it up, in a lot of ways, and I only learn from the times I mess up. You know, if it were a great, huge success, I'd probably be talking about it in some other way. And I'm still trying to figure it out. I'm still trying to figure out, with each performance, what it is and I have a couple of clues. You can't really play a character unless you believe in him totally, 100 percent. And I played Cyrano 20 years ago and, at that point in my life, I was enormously romantic and enormously in love with the idea that nothing was my fault and nothing was my problem. At this point in my life, I want to take characters like Cyrano, in a way, and shake them up and say, ''Now, come on. Stop lying to yourself about this. It's not your nose. It's not your nose. Just talk to her.'' 

Yeah. 

And that left me with a problem. It left me with a problem because this all kind of came to me in the early previews. I suddenly realize that with all the experience in the world and all of the good will in the world, you can put something together and adapt it, work on it, direct it, choose the best cast you can get, put yourself in the lead and suddenly find yourself out there, having made a very interesting mistake, which is what I think I did. And then the next three months have been about finding a way through that maze for me because I'm very confident on the stage and I'm very sure of myself as an actor. So it's the first time I found myself in the middle of performances thinking, ''You know, I don't believe in this. I don't think this is-- I think I made a mistake here.'' And then I'd suddenly find it again and nights would go by where the performances were very strong and very powerful and then I'd lose it again. And the argument inside myself is if you take Cyrano out of his world, what's left? What does he become if he isn't in pain, in his own milieu-- (crosstalk) --in the place where he's meant to be? If you take the white plume away, and the great capes and the big crowds and stuff-- 

He's not the same person. 

He's not. And it became in my mind-- yes, the pain is universal. All of us feel this. But Cyrano feels it in a particular way because he lives in a particular time. 

But if I hear you, you're saying that the mistake you made was to try to do this in a contemporary-- by taking all that stuff away, that what you had set out to do was not doable and the mistake was to set out to do it. 

No. 

Okay. 

The mistake was not to set out to do it. The mistake, I think, was in thinking that I possibly could translate it into a modern time. And ''mistake'' is really a dangerous word because I don't mean ''mistake,'' I mean a sort of strange and odd miscalculation. The victory is that I tried it. And in my work and in my life, I always think I'm a failure if I don't try. I always think I've failed-- I always fail when I don't try. Always. I'm a failure when I don't rise to the fear, whatever the fear happens to be. 

If you don't take the challenge, you're a failure-- (crosstalk) 

And that's with people, that's with a woman, that's with my work, that's with any-- friends, family. I fail if I don't try. Well, I tried and I tried very-- I still do. I try every single night. But it's an amazing experience for me. 

Now, you must talk about this with close colleagues. 

Yeah, I do. 

Because you're struggling with it. 

Yeah. 

Do they-- is there a consensus about this? Do they think you're right about this, that-- 

Well, it's difficult when something hasn't been a success. It's been really trashed by the critics. 

Right. 

Major trashed by the critics, which, again-- and I read reviews in the vain hope I'll learn something, but you don't, unfortunately, from our critical community learn much. 

Why do you think that is? 

Well, because I think they're part and parcel of what's going on in the country. I think that the need to be quick, fast, cynical and crude and vulgar and unkind is strong everywhere now. It has become, for some reason, the fashion to take a big hammer and hammer hard. 

''Fashion is the right word.'' 

Yes. And it has become sort of the norm to take something you don't like-- and I have to be very clear again, it's fine if you don't like it. I myself discovered all the things about this experience I didn't like and, with effort, over the last three months have tried to find ways every night to make it work in a way that's palatable to me and enjoyable to an audience. But if you have a big hammer, you should be rather gentle with how you use it and you should be rather compassionate and understanding. That probably is from the actor's point of view and not from the observer's point of view. Say you don't like it, but say you don't like it with some instruction. Say you don't like it with some enlightenment to the reader. Just don't say, ''This is absolutely awful. Get it off my stage,'' which is what I think has begun to happen-- not begun, is happening. And eventually, I really think that sort of criticism says more about the critic than it does about the thing he's criticizing. You get a sense that this is an angry, bitter person, often. 

Is-- are you more angry at-- are you angry at yourself because you were wrong about this? 

No. 

You, in fact, as you said, find it instructive-- 

Yeah. 

--what you did and it's a learning experience and therefore valuable. 

Yeah. I would say that in a career of 35 years, it is the single most exciting self-revelatory time I've had. 

You see, I find that stunning, Frank, because what-- what was it that was so-- my assumption, with the variety of roles that you've had, the characters that you have inhabited, and all that you've learned from those years of experience, that what you essentially have learned here has to do more with -- if I'm simplifying it, tell me -- you can't take Cyrano out of his plumage and out of his time and tell the story of unrequited love. 

Well, it's two things. I think perhaps at another time of my life, I could have. I think it was a double whammy for me. The first one was in the middle of the fourth or fifth preview, I went, ''I think you have messed this up,'' in the middle of a scene. But the second part of the reason is not just that I think taking Cyrano out of his time may have been a miscalculation. I've come to a time in my life where his pain and his anguish don't come easily to me are not things I believe in with the same intensity-- 

Now, why is that? 

--I did at 40. 

What's different? 

Well, I don't suffer from unrequited love in my life. I'm not as romantic as I used to be. And I don't care to blame anyone else for what I am. 

Meaning you're not romantic as you used to be-- means what? 

Well, it means when I was in love as a younger man, and often sometimes in love with women who were not in love with me, I was as heartbroken about it as Cyrano was. 

Yeah. 

And when I was a younger man, I was quite-- and it may have seemed from my earlier comments that I'm blaming critics. I'm not. Not at all. It's their manner I don't-- the criticism's fine, it's the manner. But now I don't think there's anybody responsible for what I am or what I-- even the woman I love. There's no room in me to blame anybody anymore. ''If only you had been like this, I wouldn't be that way.'' ''If only you'd asked this question, I would have been a better interview.'' ''If only you'd been a better friend, I wouldn't have this.'' And Cyrano's whole existence is, ''If only I didn't have this nose''-- and I'm at a time in my life where I think, ''Oh, come on. Go to a plastic surgeon.'' 

Yeah. Exactly. But let me just-- about the romance-- you're not as romantic about-- is it-- it's not, in a sense, you're not a romantic soul anymore. It's not, in a sense-- 

Oh, no. Unfortunately, I'm a very romantic soul. 

That's what I thought. 

It's just that life and experience bring you to a certain place. 

Right. 

And the place it's taking me to at this moment in my life is I-- I find it very difficult now ever to lash out against someone-- 

To blame other people for-- 

--to blame other people. And it isn't that I'm in some wonderful, noble-- 

Yeah. 

--guru type. I'm not at all. I can still be cynical and difficult and all those things, but if I really want to be honest with myself, I don't wish to say any longer in my life there is something outside myself-- 

Yeah. Exactly. 

--that causes me to be what I am and I'm tired and bored with it in my friends-- 

Yeah. 

--and in myself. 

I couldn't agree more. 

''I had bad parents.'' 

Yeah. 

''I had''-- (crosstalk) 

--victimization of life. You know, ''I'm a victim and things aren't good for me because of''-- 

Yeah. 

''I'm tall. I'm short,'' all these other things. 

Exactly. And I wrote a little-- (crosstalk) 

--''not as good-looking or I'm not as strong, I'm not as smart, I'm not as whatever'' or ''You treated me badly. You didn't give me a break. You misunderstood me'' and all that stuff. 

Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but there is one other element, which we all suffer from, about which I have enormous compassion, and that is, what is this in each of us-- 

Yeah. 

--that makes us self-destructive? What is it in each human being? You have all the money in the world or you have looks or someone you love and you're a chain smoker, you're a heavy drinker, you're-- you do drugs. You have a great career-- we see it all the time. 

Yeah. People are asking about the impact of-- go ahead. Sorry. 

What is that gene? What is that gene that causes us to mess up? 

Let's assume for a moment, to be political, in a sense, and let's assume-- and it's clearly not proven or we're not there yet. Let's assume that-- that the worst things they say about the president are true. Here is someone who is on the top of his game-- 

Yeah. 

--politically was in command of Washington. America was the most powerful country. And all of a sudden, perhaps, if it's true, because of a flaw, is tumbling down. 

Well, here is someone who is a man. He's not a president, he's a man. He's a human man first. 

A human frailty, if it's true. 

All the stuff we talk about about this is about situation and environment and job, but he's a man first. And if we really want to, as men-- we all understand it, don't we. 

Yes. 

And all humans understand it and, actually, women understand it. He's a man and the-- 

So your compassion-- even if it's true, you come to this-- 

Quite compassionate. 

--judgment-- compassionate-- 

Because in a funny way-- and I guess we're now running with the pack, aren't we, because this is not a-- this is what everybody's talking about today. 

Of course. 

In a funny way, what we discussed at the beginning of this talk, about cynicism and criticism, is true not in just theatrical criticism or dance criticism or-- it's true in the media now, too. It's true in the way everybody approaches any public figure's frailty. There is a sense of judgment now that is frightening me. I don't understand why it's so severe. And you can say, ''All right, it's calling people to task. It's asking them to stand up and be this and be noble and''-- but I don't buy that. I think-- I think we're so quick to say about someone else's frailty, ''Well, get over it.'' You know, ''Come on. You don't-- you don't have to do that.'' I mean, how many women are going to say on television, ''Keep your pants zipped up''? There aren't many men who can. You know, it's degree. 

Yeah, a lot of people step forward and say, though, you know-- 

What? 

Responsibility demands more. 

You cannot-- 

Responsibility demands more. And you're saying, ''I don't care about responsibility.'' 

No, I'm saying-- 

We're talking-- taking it out of that circumstance, responsibility demands more and you're saying what, we're all-- 

I'm saying-- 

--ruled by the same-- 

I'm saying we're all-- 

--the same passions. 

--animals and each one of us is if not ruled, certainly driven all our lives by our sexual urge, each one of us. It's-- I guess it is truly how we handle it, but we should have compassion for people who can't quite handle it in the way we do or people who choose a lover of the same sex or men who choose to dress up in women's clothing or men who love beautiful women constantly. 

In this context-- I've approached this before, but just tell me. What is it that draws you and Whoopi together? 

Oh, well, you know, it's very hard because you don't want to say all of the-- ''My best friend,'' ''sense of humor,'' all of those things. 

Yeah, I know you don't. It sounds-- 

I suppose the best thing I can say is that-- there's a line at the end of Cyrano that just comes to my mind. It may be corny, but it's true. ''I shall find there those other souls who should be friends of mine.'' And in this woman I found the ''other soul who should be my friend,'' you know? As I now refer to her, ''My little center square.'' But this-- there is a soul here that is remarkable beyond all measure. There is-- only just beginning, only at-- I mean, I think the next 20 years, you'll find this is someone who grows truly into greatness with each year. 

You seem to me to be at the best time in your life, notwithstanding coming off something that wasn't a critical success. But you seem to be-- you've got a pretty good fix on-- and you're pretty-- in pretty good shape, however you got there-- 

Yeah. 

--and whoever-- I mean, in a sense, if you're responsible for your own self and you can't blame someone else, you also take responsibility for your own growth, you know? And in the end-- 

I think-- 

--you should be-- you should pat yourself on the back. 

Well, I'm not going to. I'll let you do it. I think it's because I got there over broken glass-- 

Really? 

--as most people do. 

You got there with pain. 

Yeah. And it's the only way to get there. Every single night I go to this theater, I'm in pain over the things I didn't do, over the things I wished I'd thought of, over the choices I made. And every performance, I'm in pain. But two or three times a week-- a teacher said to me when I was a very young man, ''Don't ever look for inspiration. Don't ever look for magic when you're an actor. Just go out and do the work. And then, on some rainy Wednesday with about 75 people in the audience and a flop, you and the lights and your co-actor and the music will all come together and you'll have this kind of extraordinary feeling that you can't possibly explain and that'll keep you doing it.'' And that happens to me in Cyrano still. Even in a production I feel I didn't pull off, there are nights when it simply flies and sings and I'm thrilled to be saying these words. And then the next night, I go out and I say, ''This is hard, hard work because it's my job to make you believe something I may not.'' 

Yeah. Frank Langella. Thank you for joining us.
