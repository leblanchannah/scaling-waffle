Unknown Speaker:-- coming up. 

Charlie Rose:Michael Kaiser's been called the ``Mr. Fixit of performing arts institutions.'' Over the past 15 years, he has revived the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, the Washington Opera, the American Ballet Theater and many others. In 1998, he was appointed executive director of the Royal Opera House in London. In his short time there, he was credited with rescuing the company from financial ruin. This year he took over as president of the Kennedy Center in Washington. Already Kaiser has scored a major coup with the recent announcement of a gift from arts patron Alberto Vilar. The $50 million donation is the largest ever made to the 30-year-old performing arts center. It makes Michael Kaiser very happy. Welcome to the broadcast. 

Michael Kaiser:Thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:How does this happen? I mean, all of a sudden, there is a man who says, ``I''-- tell me the story. 

Michael Kaiser:Well, I met Alberto in London when I was at the Royal Opera House, and we were fund-raising really aggressively to finish the reconstruction of the opera house. And he expressed some interest in the project through a friend of mine. And we got together, and he decided to make a major 

Charlie Rose:To the Royal Opera House. 

Michael Kaiser:--to the Royal Opera House, to the finishing of the building. And then he made a second large gift to establish a young artists program. And we became friends in this process. And when I decided to come to the Kennedy Center, he said he wanted to help, and we talked through some projects. And there was the grant. 

Charlie Rose:Thirty million dollars! 

Michael Kaiser:Fifty million dollars. 

Charlie Rose:Fifty million dollars! That's help, isn't it. 

Michael Kaiser:It's a big help. 

Charlie Rose:Why does he do it? 

Michael Kaiser:He has a true-- 

Charlie Rose:Other than just to help. 

Michael Kaiser:He has a true passion for the arts. He truly loves the arts. And when he meets people in the arts who he trusts, then he decides to invest in them. And it's a wonderful relationship. I think he enjoys his patronage, and we obviously enjoy his patronage, as well. 

Charlie Rose:We should have more of that. 

Michael Kaiser:Well, I think-- 

Charlie Rose:And I say that not to be glib, but it is this notion of the significance of culture to the life blood of a nation. And in America, culture needs support. 

Michael Kaiser:Absolutely, it needs support. But I have to say, having worked on the other side of the ocean, I take great pride in being an American because of the huge number of people in this country comparatively who are willing to put their own personal money into the arts. 

Charlie Rose:There's more government support in countries across the ocean and less private, and here more private and much less government. 

Michael Kaiser:That's true. But what's happening in Europe -- and it's very scary -- is that governments are being forced to cut back on their arts patronage. And the arts institutions there do not really know how to cope with that change because they don't know how to build a private philanthropy. 

Charlie Rose:And there's no tradition. 

Michael Kaiser:There's no tradition, and there's really no expertise. And one of the reasons that Mr. Vilar gave us this big gift was to establish an arts management training program to train both Americans and foreigners in how do you run an arts organization in this world today. 

Charlie Rose:Why can't arts institutions make it on their own? Why can't they be profit-making? 

Michael Kaiser:The central problem is one of productivity. In any other industry, you become more productive over time. But we still use the same number of singers to sing Don Giovanni as when it was written 300 years ago. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Michael Kaiser:We still have the same number of seats in the Kennedy Center as when it was built 30 years ago. 

Charlie Rose:And it wouldn't work to have a computer do it, would it. 

Michael Kaiser:No. So we can't improve productivity the way you can in any other industry, and that means over time, it gets harder and harder economically. 

Charlie Rose:But revenues go up. 

Michael Kaiser:But revenue can't go up to accommodate all of the cost increases, the cost increase is greater than the ability to generate ticket revenue. So you have to look for private support. 

Charlie Rose:Is there a difference in the appreciation of the arts in other countries, especially Europe, than in America? 

Michael Kaiser:I think there's maybe more of a tradition of attending the classical arts in Europe, although I have to say that we've had incredible growth in this country in attendance at symphonic performances, at operas, at ballet. So I have to say that I've noticed people all over the world enjoy good art. And I've worked in South Africa, and I've worked in London, and I've worked in this country. And if the art is good, people are there. 

Charlie Rose:How did you get to this kind of work? 

Michael Kaiser:I had a very unusual sort of schizophrenic background. I was trained as an opera singer. I was very, very interested in music and in performing. I just wasn't very good, and I was much better at my studies of math and science. And so I ended up studying economics-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Michael Kaiser:--and had a business career, but also this great love for the arts, and eventually decided that I really was going to do the arts full-time, and here I am. 

Charlie Rose:And arts need people with sort of superb management skills. 

Michael Kaiser:They do, but it's very important that-- to recognize the difference in running a corporation from running an arts organization. The big difference is one of mission. It's very easy to measure your success in a steel company, an automobile company. If your stock price is high and stays high, you've done a great job. In the arts, it's harder to measure success. Is it your reviews? Is it your attendance? Is it your balance sheet? It's much harder. 

Charlie Rose:How do you measure it? 

Michael Kaiser:It's a personal measure, a feeling that you have done great art and that you've done great education and that many, many people have been edified by your work. It is not by your income statement at the end of the year, and if the organizations I ran simply had erased their deficits but had produced bad art, I wouldn't have felt like I had been successful. 

Charlie Rose:You said something interesting which I actually believe in. You know, I have a great appreciation of risk and the idea that, you know, if you don't dare, you will not, you know, find greatness. You once said that you have to have in your budget room for failure. 

Michael Kaiser:Absolutely. If you're going to produce art, you're going to produce some failure. And you have to plan for that economically, and you also have to play for it emotionally. You have to-- you have to get your patrons and your board and your staff ready for not succeeding every now and then. And you hope your track record is a good one at the end of the day, but there will be failure. 

Charlie Rose:Talk about the Kennedy Center. Now, I mean, you came from-- you've had experience at great institutions and great artistic troupes, or sort of communities. What-- how-- where is the Kennedy Center in terms of where it ought to be, in terms of the reputation and the place it stands in the nation? 

Michael Kaiser:It's a very good question-- 

Charlie Rose:Does it need work? 

Michael Kaiser:Well, I think every arts organization needs work. And if you're in the arts, you're always striving for perfection, and you never get there. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Michael Kaiser:I think the Kennedy Center has done a fantastic job of building high-quality programming in a range of the art forms because the Kennedy Center presents opera and ballet and theater and symphonic music and chamber music and jazz. It's a very wide portfolio. What one is always trying to do is to try and increase the amount and the quality of the programming and of the educational programming. The Kennedy Center does more arts education than any other organization in the world. 

Charlie Rose:What's arts education? 

Michael Kaiser:It is introducing children to the arts. It is introducing adults to the arts. It is-- it is training young musicians. It's a whole range of programming that we work on throughout the United States. We work in 50 states of the union, and I think that's something that we don't maybe know about the Kennedy Center. And so I'll say that one of the areas I need to work on the most with the Kennedy Center is the marketing because we do a lot more programming in a lot more places than people know of. 

Charlie Rose:An example? 

Michael Kaiser:We will be going to Oklahoma next month with the National Symphony Orchestra and having a residency where they will be playing concerts and working with children, introducing them to symphonic music throughout the state of Oklahoma. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Michael Kaiser:And I'm sure you won't know about that. 

Charlie Rose:No, you 

Michael Kaiser:And we have to work on that. But this is one program, and we have hundreds of these programs. 

Charlie Rose:You've got great arts institutions in America. Lincoln Center is here, and others are here. 

Michael Kaiser:Right. 

Charlie Rose:But-- a place that does a lot of the same things that the Kennedy Center does. You know, what should Kennedy Center represent? Should it be the-- identified as the nation's cultural center? 

Michael Kaiser:It should be and it will be. And what that requires us to do more of is to produce some more unique art at the Kennedy Center. Last autumn, the Kennedy Center hosted a Balanchine festival, which brought performers from around the world to perform-- 

Charlie Rose:And made people in New York-- --very jealous. 

Michael Kaiser:That's the kind of programming that makes you the national center, and that's the kind of programming that we'll be doing more of in the future. 

Charlie Rose:And so why -- A -- haven't you been doing more of that? And what does it take to do more of it in the future? 

Michael Kaiser:Takes a lot of planning, and it takes a good amount of fund-raising. And those are the two areas that I like to work in. 

Charlie Rose:OK, but I mean-- but what does that say? Does that say that the reason the Kennedy Center hasn't achieved its potential is because of planning and fund-raising, rather than the inspiration of artists? 

Michael Kaiser:I hate to say it hasn't achieved its potential because again, you're on this continuum. It's only 30 years old. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Michael Kaiser:And you're constantly trying to do more and-- 

Charlie Rose:Fair enough, but-- 

Michael Kaiser:--better. 

Charlie Rose:But you've just said that it ought to be better 

Michael Kaiser:Absolutely. 

Charlie Rose:--arts institution. 

Michael Kaiser:I would say that has more to do with marketing than with programming. And the truth of the matter is that arts organizations don't know how to market themselves very well. That is not just the Kennedy Center. That is throughout the country and throughout the world. Arts institutions, because they're under such pressure to sell their tickets, have spent so much time focusing on how do you market an individual performance of Giselle or of Tosca or an individual symphonic performance and have spent much too little time worrying about how do you sell your whole institution. And one of the things I've tried to do when I've run each of the organizations you mentioned before was to try and develop the institutional profile. When I got to the Alvin Ailey company and Alex Haley died, I received many, many letters of condolence because the population thought that Alex Haley and Alvin Ailey were the same person. 

Charlie Rose:Yes! 

Michael Kaiser:I don't think they'd make that same mistake today because-- identity to-- To the Alvin Ailey company. 

Charlie Rose:--the Alvin Ailey company. 

Michael Kaiser:And that's something that we have to do. When you go to London, you go to the Royal Shakespeare Company, whether they're doing Coriolanus or Macbeth, you go to the Royal Shakespeare Company because you want to see the Royal Shakespeare Company. And one's aim when one runs any arts organization is to create that level of institutional identity. 

Charlie Rose:And you do that by? 

Michael Kaiser:You do that with PR. You do that with very special events. You do that by constantly pushing what you're doing into the public consciousness. And you do it in a very, very organized fashion. 

Charlie Rose:But-- and how much of your role -- you role -- is it to be a creative force in terms of bringing the most talented people-- and I mean by this directors and conductors and-- and those kinds of people to the institution? Is that your job, too? 

Michael Kaiser:In part, yes. Absolutely. I have a wonderful staff that works with me, wonderful artistic advisers-- Leonard Slatkin, who's the great music director of the National Symphony Orchestra-- --and Placido Domingo at the Washington Opera and Suzanne Farrell, who is building a ballet company at the Kennedy Center. These are wonderful artistic minds with whom I've very, very honored to collaborate. But yes, my job is to think about artistic ventures, but it's also been to find the resources to pay for those ventures. 

Charlie Rose:There is always the argument -- and Kennedy Center's gone through this -- that perhaps the-- there is at Lincoln Center and lots of other places, at the ABT and places like that-- a lot of people who are doing traditional culture at the highest level. 

Michael Kaiser:Right. 

Charlie Rose:What the Kennedy Center ought to be about is the highest level of experimentation. 

Michael Kaiser:I think-- 

Charlie Rose:Peter Sellers, et cetera, et cetera. 

Michael Kaiser:Sure. I think it has to be about both. And I think if you're going to be the national center, you've an obligation to showcase the greatest work. That work might be more traditional, as you're suggesting, but it also has to be some more experimental work. Right now, we have an AmericArtes festival that's showcasing very, very contemporary Latin American art. You won't see that in most other places in this country or in this world. It's a wonderful festival at the Kennedy Center. So I agree with you, we have an obligation to showcase the very, very cutting-edge work. But we don't do our job if that's all we show because we have a population in the Washington area that also has a right to see the more traditional work, as well. 

Charlie Rose:And every place they do. 

Michael Kaiser:And every place. 

Charlie Rose:I mean, there has to be some way to find a combination of those kind of things, and that's why-- that's why you have off-Broadway and Broadway. 

Michael Kaiser:But I think New York's a bad example because there is so much art in New York that various arts institutions can specialize. The Brooklyn Academy of Music can be very different from Lincoln Center. 

Charlie Rose:Exactly. Exactly. 

Michael Kaiser:In most other cities, you don't have that proliferation of the arts, so that the leading center has to play several roles at once. 

Charlie Rose:Does-- is somewhere in the back of your head, not at the top of your agenda, this notion that this unachievable dream of having a national theater can be achieved? 

Michael Kaiser:I think it's hard to have a national theater in a country that is as spread out geographically as we are. 

Charlie Rose:With all the regional theaters and-- 

Michael Kaiser:With all the regional theaters. I mean, who's to say that anyone's going to start a new theater that is the national theater? It is different from the European countries, where the capitals-- 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Michael Kaiser:--tend to house the national theaters. And I'm tremendously excited by the proliferation of regional arts in this country. And as the head of the Kennedy Center, I feel an obligation to work with regional arts organizations and bring the best of the regional arts to the Kennedy Center, as well. 

Charlie Rose:And also give them an opportunity to have the best of the Kennedy Center come to their places-- 

Michael Kaiser:That's it. 

Charlie Rose:--as you're doing with Leonard Slatkin and-- 

Michael Kaiser:That's correct. In Oklahoma. That's correct. Absolutely. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. What scares you the most about this assignment? 

Michael Kaiser:Well, you're-- you're always scared on two fronts. You always want to make sure that the art you're doing is wonderful and great, and you're always afraid that you're not going to be able to pay for it. So there's lots of reasons to be fearful. And-- 

Charlie Rose:And if you do bad today, you're not going to be able to pay for the next one that comes around because you will have lost some public support. 

Michael Kaiser:That's exactly right. So-- 

Charlie Rose:Or private support. 

Michael Kaiser:So I spend my life in fear. 

Charlie Rose:And do you, when you go to the opera, sit there in your privileged chair, look up and say, ``Ah! 

Michael Kaiser:No. What I say is-- what I hope to do-- for a great performance, I sit back and just enjoy it. 

Charlie Rose:Do you really? I mean-- 

Michael Kaiser:When it's not a great performance, I sit back and think about all the things I'd change. 

Charlie Rose:I mean, you-- now, no regrets? In other words, you sort of think that, ``Look, things turned out the way they were meant to be. I was-- I have a unique talent for this, and I'd rather be the best institutional leader than just a''-- 

Michael Kaiser:I'd go further. I'd say-- 

Charlie Rose:--``average singer.'' the stage. Is it really? 

Michael Kaiser:Absolutely. I'm developing a artistic program. I'm developing a marketing program. I'm developing a fund-raising program. It's a very creative field and one that not enough people think about entering. 

Charlie Rose:And you have all that power. 

Michael Kaiser:It's really not so much about power. It's more about-- about inspiration and the ability to collaborate with so many great people. I mean, if you think about the people I work with -- Judith Jamison and Bernard Haitink in London and now Leonard Slatkin and Placido and Valery Gergiev. I've worked with all these people. Who gets that chance? 

Charlie Rose:That's a good point. America and-- somebody once said to me about my show-- I think it was my friend, Larry King, once said to me, he said, ``You know, you like to have that ballet and opera stars on that show. We don't do much of that.'' I mean, as if somehow that there wasn't an-- not he thought this, but just the notion that somehow there wasn't a widespread curiosity about ballet and opera and symphonic music and-- 

Michael Kaiser:And I would argue with that. If you look at the numbers, there are just huge numbers of people coming to each of those art forms you just mentioned. I think what is tragic is that we're not introducing in the public school system these art forms as much as we did when I was growing up. And I think the arts organizations have a responsibility now to fill that void. 

Charlie Rose:It is a real problem, isn't it. I mean, there is no sense of outreach to introduce at the youngest level. 

Michael Kaiser:There is now on the part of the arts organizations, but there isn't on the part of the school systems of most countries-- most counties in this country. 

Charlie Rose:When you look at the Kennedy Center, you know, and-- what's-- how do you-- how do you make the balance between all the various arts, in terms of budget, in terms of commitment, in terms of-- 

Michael Kaiser:It is somewhat arbitrary. One sits and you look at a year and say, ``How much of each art form can we get that is wonderful? How much of each art form can we get that we can afford? How do we schedule it so that different-- similar attractions don't compete with each other?'' It's a very, very large balancing act, and there's a large staff that worries about the scheduling and the programming of our attractions for that very reason. 

Charlie Rose:You have turned around places, as we've mentioned. Covent Garden is one. 

Michael Kaiser:Right. 

Charlie Rose:Is this a turnaround at Kennedy Center, or something else? 

Michael Kaiser:No. No, it's different. I feel like I've spent the last 15 years working with troubled 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, I was going to say! 

Michael Kaiser:--and the reason why I've done that is to learn what makes a healthy organization. 

Charlie Rose:Well, I mean, you almost say, ``Well, gee, if he's coming to the Kennedy Center, we must be in trouble because that's the only places he goes.'' 

Michael Kaiser:No, it's absolutely not a turnaround. I now feel like I know how to make a healthy organization, so I hope to take the Kennedy Center to new heights, but it's certainly building on a very strong base. But those that were troubled, what-- was there a common problem that they had, or-- Absolutely. 

Charlie Rose:It was? 

Michael Kaiser:Absolutely. What happens in so many arts organizations-- and by the way, not-for-profit organizations, not just arts organizations -- is that when you hit a financial bump, the inclination of the staff and the board is always to cut back. And where it's easiest to cut back is on new artistic ventures and on marketing because you don't have to fire anyone to do that. You'll do one old production versus a new one, or you'll spend a little less on advertising. Well, if you think about it, the very things that bring you an audience and patrons are artistic initiative and marketing. So, when you start cutting back on that, you're creating a vicious spiral. You cut back, you have less money. You cut back more, you have less money. And you get into this very, very situation. And the trick to a turnaround is very simple -- marshal all the resources you have, put it into great art and marketing that art. And you'll get a little bit more money and you put it back into art and marketing and you have more money. And that's how I turned around Ailey. That's how we turned around ABT and the Royal Opera House. 

Charlie Rose:You've just made lots of marketing and advertising and promotional people very happy. 

Michael Kaiser:But the art has to be good. There's no point in the not-for-profit world to try and promote bad art. So the reason you do this is not the marketing, the reason you do this is the good art. But the marketing is required to get the resources to continue to produce good art consistently. 

Charlie Rose:You don't-- I mean, I assume-- I know there are courses and I know there are places you can go to study art's management. 

Michael Kaiser:Right. 

Charlie Rose:But I assume you had to-- this is on the job training. I mean, you didn't-- 

Michael Kaiser:It's a relatively young field and it's been taught in university for maybe 20 years. 

Charlie Rose:Like hotel management or something. 

Michael Kaiser:So much of this I have learned on the job. And the reason to start the Vilar Institute of Arts Management is exactly this. 

Charlie Rose:Oh, that's what some of this money is going for? 

Michael Kaiser:That's what the vast majority is going for. 

Charlie Rose:So this $50 million is to do what? 

Michael Kaiser:To do two things. One is to bring the Kirov Opera and Ballet to the Kennedy Center every year for the next 10 years. 

Charlie Rose:Because he likes the Kirov? 

Michael Kaiser:Because I like the Kirov. He happens to like the Kirov too, but I wouldn't do it just to please the donor. 

Charlie Rose:You wouldn't? 

Michael Kaiser:Of course not. Of course not. 

Charlie Rose:Suppose I came to you and said I want to give -- and this is obviously not going to happen -- but I want to give $50 million to the Kennedy Center. And I want part of that money to bring-- let's choose somebody good -- the Paris Opera, to the Kennedy Center every year. I happen to be, as the donor, in love with the Paris Opera, which happens to be run by an American. What would you say? What that be a problem for you? 

Michael Kaiser:It would be a problem for me if I didn't feel that the Paris Opera deserved that kind of showcase at the Kennedy Center and I wouldn't take the money. 

Charlie Rose:You'd have to feel that it deserved-- that the-- let's take the Paris Opera, deserved that kind of showcase? 

Michael Kaiser:Correct. In a real situation, let's take the Kirov because this is a true situation. I believe the Kirov is producing some of the great opera and the great ballet in the world today. And I do believe it does deserve that kind of showcase every year in this country. And so I am thrilled to bring Valery Gergiev and the Kirov every year to the Kennedy Center. This was my idea. I went to Alberto Vilar with that proposal; he didn't come to me. 

Charlie Rose:I see. So did he have a special love for the Kirov? Or he just happened to like them? 

Michael Kaiser:It is one of the organizations that he supports. But he supports so many that I had a lot to choose from if that was the only reason I was going after an organization. 

Charlie Rose:OK, but then here's a question -- were you going to choose one of his for sure? That you knew he had some interest in or he'd given something to? 

Michael Kaiser:Absolutely not. The Kirov, for instance, I had them for eight weeks at Covent Garden last summer. So-- and that was not supported by Mr. Vilar. So I have a commitment and a relationship to that organization that goes certainly beyond any one patron. So that's what some of the money is for. But the majority of the money is to start an institute-- an arts management institute. We're going to be an on the job training-- 

Charlie Rose:The Kennedy School of Arts Management? 

Michael Kaiser:The Vilar Institute for Arts Management at the Kennedy Center. And we're going to have an on the job training to train young entrepreneurial arts managers. Give them classroom training and practical. 

Charlie Rose:And so you'll be Professor Kaiser? 

Michael Kaiser:And I've taught at NYU for six years, so it feels natural. 

Charlie Rose:Back to sort of the arts discussion. Other than the Kirov, what would qualify in your head for things that you think deserve more attention in America, around the world, whether it's Japan or China or Latin America, Europe? 

Michael Kaiser:Well, there's so many great artists. I mean it's hard-- how do I pick one or two. But I think that what I would love to see at the Kennedy Center is some more serious theater, some great theater. Perhaps theater that we produce ourselves. I'd love to see some attention to song. I think we don't spend a lot of time thinking about song in most of our arts institutions today -- the art song. And there are some-- there happen to be at this point in time a whole host of great American singers -- Renee Fleming, Susan Graham, Dawn Upshaw, Tom Hampson -- who are absolute leading proponents of song. We'd love to have more of that at the Kennedy Center. So there's a whole lot to be done. 

Charlie Rose:Thank you for coming. 

Michael Kaiser:Thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:A pleasure to meet you. Michael Kaiser of the Kennedy Center. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
