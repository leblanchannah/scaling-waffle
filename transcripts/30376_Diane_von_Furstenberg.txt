The 8th Annual DVF Awards took place this month. Launched in 2010, by the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation, the awards honor women committed to improving the lives of other women. Recipients are also granted $50,000 for their non-profit work. Dr. Jane Goodall received the year's lifetime leadership award. The renowned conservationist founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977 to help protect chimpanzees and promote environmental sustainability. Joining me now is Diane von Furstenberg and Dr. Jane Goodall. I'm pleased to have both of them back at this table. Tell me why you created this. 

Well, actually, I've always been extremely inspired by these incredible women who have the strength to fight and the courage to survive. And after that, the leadership to inspire. And my children, my son said, you should do a prize, something that you can actually give exposure to people and also the foundation can give the money. If you do it, years after years, it will last after you. And so -- 

Sounded like a good idea. 

It sounded like a good idea. But I was very shy how to go about it. And when Tina started the first Women in the World Conference, I thought, oh, well, this is a perfect moment to start. And so, eight years ago, we started. It's on the second night of the Women in the World Conference. And it happens at the UN. And it's kind of intimate. At first, I was very shy. But it's been amazing. And I was able to honor women who have done extraordinary work, who are completely unknown, and given them exposure and sometimes - a lot of them became CNN Heroes and more and more. And it's like a family. I keep up with them and I know them and it's a beautiful thing. And, of course, the lifetime award has gone to people like Hillary Clinton and Gloria Steinem and Oprah and now Jane Goodall, who I am so excited to meet and to be able to speak to. 

So, you had not met her before? 

No, no. 

Oh, my goodness. 

No, no. We met -- here we are. 

You met here at this table? 

We met here at this table. Yes. 

So, how do you feel on receiving this? 

Well, I think -- 

It's not the first award for you. 

No, but it's a great honor. And I think everything like this is helping me to get out a message to people, which I think is tremendously important at this time when we're doing so much to harm the planet, when there is so much discrimination, when there is so much to try and put right. 

So much -- not lack of understanding of how precarious it is. 

It's really precarious, I mean, climate change, if you deny climate change, there is something very strange. And the fact that we have had an impact on the warming of the planet, it's pretty conclusive from all the scientific reports. 

And you brought some friends with you here? 

Well, yes. This is cow. And people know about carbon dioxide, burning of fossil fuel, adding to the greenhouse gases. But so, too, with heavy meat eating because when you cut the forest down, which releases CO2, and two, it's a waste of water to change plant protein to animal protein. But in addition, there are now billions of animals cooped up in tiny spaces, they all need to be fed. And food goes in one end and gas comes out the other. And that's methane. That's an even more vicious greenhouse gas. 

What does the institute do? 

We try to make the world a better place. No, we started off conservation of chimpanzees and the forest as well as studying them. It dawned on me one day, it just hit me, flying over the little Gombe National Park where we still do research. It was once part of a forest. And when I looked down, it was a tiny little oasis of forest surrounded by completely bare hills. More people than the land could support, too poor to buy food from elsewhere. And that's when it hit me, unless we improved the lives of the people, unless we do something about this crippling poverty, where you have to cut the trees down to try and grow food or make some money with charcoal, we can't -- conservation simply won't work. We've got to work with the local people and have them as our partners. 

How successful have you been? 

We started with 12 villages around Gombe National Park. We're now in 52. The trees have come back. There is no more bare hills. And we've got this program in six other African countries in or around chimpanzee habitats. 

Is this your proudest achievement? 

I think that the achievement that I am most excited about, that is one. But, two, our youth program. Because what's the point of working to save the environment, chimps, anything else if the next generation isn't going to be better stewards than we've been. So, what began with 12 high-school students in Tanzania is now in 98 countries. We've got members from kindergarten through university. We've got about 1,500 active groups. And it's changing attitudes. In China, everybody I met last time said, oh, of course, we care about the environment. We were in your Roots & Shoots program when we were in primary school. And it's certainly changing attitudes in many other countries around the world. 

There are lots of articles now because of what has happened in terms of opposition to Paris and other things in which people point to China as taking the lead. China announced that it will take the lead. They're up at the top with solar. They want to do clean green energy. And they're now -- And when? Well, they're doing it now. They're already ahead in solar energy. And the silly thing is that solar energy and all these other wind and tide, they can provide hundreds of thousands of jobs and it's sustainable. Yes. And the technology is getting better and better -- 

Better and better. 

-- to be able to maintain the storage of... 

It's already cheaper. 

Already cheaper? 

Unfortunately, governments -- 

Than fossil fuels? 

Yes, governments go on supporting fossil fuel because of the power and the money and the corruption. And the fact that we've developed into a society -- 

Cheap has always what's been the vulnerability of fossil fuel in terms of being able to lunge forward was make it cheaper, to have it become -- 

Yes, which means destroying the environment. 

No, no, no. I'm talking about alternative fuels, alternative sources. 

Oh, yes, yes. 

When you can make sun and wind and other sources, alternative sources cheaper than fossil fuel -- 

Yes. 

-- then you'll win the game. 

Yeah and we could easily. 

Yes. 

If subsidies went to the clean green energy rather than the fossil fuel industry. 

But I'm also interested too, companies like ExxonMobil announced that it is supporting them when they came down that the president was -- during the campaign was opposed to the Paris Agreement, ExxonMobil announced that they very much support it. 

Yes, because they see a writing on the wall. 

Yes. You have given up running your company. You have a CEO who runs it for you, correct? 

No, what I have is -- I hired a chief creative officer, a wonderful, talented English man -- Scottish, actually -- and he's great. He has a lot of talent. He's young, he's excited. And so, I have -- yes, so I am, I really am supporting him to take over and bring it to the next, you know, to the next whatever, to focus on my third act. 

What is your third act? 

My third act is to try to use whatever -- when you get to be successful a little bit, right, one, you can pay your bills; and two, you have a voice. And I think that it's imperative -- it's a privilege, but it's a duty to use your voice for people who have no voice or to connect with people with a voice in order to communicate and let those voices out, so that we weave into a fabric of impact and compassion and results. 

Are you in the midst of that third act now? 

What do you mean? I hope I'm at the beginning. What do you mean? 

Well, it didn't happen yesterday. 

Yes, yes. 

This is the eighth year of these awards. 

That is true. That's true. But, now, I want to spend more time in mentoring. You were talking about young people. It's so important to inspire young people and to -- one of the other girls who is winning the award tomorrow, she has an organization called iCivics. And she is -- what she's doing is she's putting civics classes into national schools. That is so important. So important. And right now, actually, we have an opportunity because people are very confused with what is happening. It's very scary what is happening. So, we have an opportunity and a window to let everybody say, OK, each one of us has a little bit of power. Each one of us can affect somebody else. And I know that you feel that way. 

Every one of us makes an impact on the planet every day. 

And together, we can have a huge impact. 

Together, we have a huge impact. And I truly believe only when head and heart work in harmony. The trouble is we have gone too far with the head. 

Meaning? 

Meaning that we're making decisions based on how does this affect me now or the next shareholders' meeting, the next political campaign, rather than, what about the next generation? 

How far along are we in terms of really being where we should be in women's -- the empowerment of women? 

We've certainly moved further than we were 50 years ago. 

Of course you have, or ten years. 

We've got a long way to go in some countries, but it's getting better. 

One of the things at Tina's conference you get a chance to appreciate is sort of the global impact of women, and at the same time the global struggle of women. 

It's incredible. My mother always told me that I was lucky to be a woman, right? My mother was very much like that. You are lucky because when she referred to men, she always said "le povre". 

She said what? 

"Le povre" means, be nice to them. 

Tap them on the head, nice boy, nice boy. 

So, that's how I was raised. And then I was in the world of fashion where to be a woman was easy. And I didn't -- I never was like in a job that I competed with men on an equal basis and so on. So, I never really felt sexism. But today, I do. Today, I feel like we -- in so many ways, we have gone back. 

There's one of the Native American tribes, and they say, we see our people as like an eagle. And one wing is male and one wing is female. And we'll only achieve our true potential when the two wings are equal. 

Exactly. 

And that I really like. 

Tell me what your ambitions are now. 

Well, my ambition is to grow this youth program because it's involving young people, it's youth driven. They choose projects, make the world better for people, animals and the environment. But running through it is a theme of -- we need peace and harmony. We need to learn peace and harmony between people in different nations, different cultures, different religions and between us and the natural world. So, it's very much creating a family of young people growing up and sharing the same values. And it's now been going -- it began in '91, so there's a lot of people now out there in leadership positions. And I keep meeting them. And they all say it changed us to be part of that program. 

So, maybe you repeat the name, so people know of the program. 

Roots & Shoots. 

Roots & Shoots. 

Roots & Shoots. 

You think of a big tree and you started as a little seed, and then little roots and the little shoot, seems very weak, but those little roots to reach the water can push aside rocks and that little shoot to reach the sun can break through brick balls. So, we think of all the problems, environmental and social, as roots and shoots. Hundreds and thousands. 

What's one of the great things in your life, the circumstances that created this mission with respect to chimpanzees, the connection between you and chimpanzees? 

I think the important thing there really was that, when I first began, it was thought that the difference between us humans and the rest of the animal kingdom was one of a kind. And we were totally separate, totally unique, and totally superior. And the chimpanzees are so like us biologically and, as I discovered, behaviorally, that the science began to change the way it was thinking. And today, it's accepted by most that we are part of, and not separated from this amazing, wonderful, and exciting -- 

Long chain of human evolution. 

Yes. 

Is it true that it's only the humans who are not necessary to the chain? 

Well, I don't know about that. I never heard that said. But maybe. I think the rest of the world would do better without us, that's for sure. 

We actually have no function other than memory. 

One of my reasons for hope is the youth and the resilience of nature, but also the indomitable human spirit, the people who tackle the impossible and succeed because they won't give up or they get others to follow them. And the thing is that every single one of us has this indomitable spirit. We've just got to find ways to allow people to grow it and get out there. 

Well, you're singing my song, I can tell you that. As she knows from a long, long, long friendship. 

No, I believe that. I believe in -- I don't believe in the evilness at all. We have to believe -- 

It's not innate, evil. It's lack of education and very often lack of awareness, lack of understanding. 

Lack of confidence. 

The development of fear. 

When young people understand and we empower them to take action, Roots & Shoots is all about working out what you can do about something you care about. Not something I tell you to care about. Something you care about. 

You can change so much. 

And then, you roll up your sleeves and you get out together, you do it. And it's empowering. 

It's great to see you. 

It's very good to see you, Charlie, again. 

Thank you. And you, my dear. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
