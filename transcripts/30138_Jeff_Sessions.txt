Good evening, I'm Jeff Glor filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin tonight with politics. After delivering a well received address to Congress on Tuesday night, President Trump and his administration are mired in controversy again. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. This followed new revelations that Sessions met with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. in the lead-up to November's election. Sessions addressed the situation at a news conference late yesterday afternoon. 

I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaign for president of the United States. I went on to say this announcement should not be interpreted as confirmation of the existence of any investigation or suggestive of the scope of any such investigation. 

While several top Democrats have called for Sessions to resign, President Trump has remained stoutly behind him. Joining us from Washington is Eric Lichtblau of "The New York Times" and Karen Tumulty of "The Washington Post." Thank you both for joining us. Karen, let me start with you, what's next on the Sessions front? 

Well, I think what is next is what has been going on all along which is sort of the drip, drip of more and more reports of contacts of people in the president's circle with the Russians or with Russian officials. What's really surprising I think at this point, and perhaps it is a reflection of the fact that the White House is populated primarily with campaign aides and not sort of seasoned Washington hands, is that the Trump team seems to have not sort of gotten its arms around what the facts are here -- you know, who had contacts, how many -- and if they don't, this appears like it could be headed toward some sort of outside, even a, you know -- either a select committee or some kind of outside investigation. There is talk on the Hill. I don't know how far that would get, about the need for some kind of special prosecutor in this. But unless the White House and the president can get ahead of all these revelations, you know, it is going to turn into something bigger. 

Is that why they're not getting ahead of this, Karen, in your estimation, because they're not the insiders? 

I think that is one explanation because, of course, you know, the first impulse, the first rule in the playbook on a campaign is if somebody hits you, you hit them back. I think people who have been around these sorts of issues from the perspective of having been in government for them, again, know the first thing you do is get your facts straight. I think the other problem here is the president's tendency to personalize what are big issues with big implications. So he has framed this in tweets, in his statements as some sort of just beefing on the part of Democrats over the fact that they didn't win the election, as opposed to an actual, you know, threat to the security of the country. He hasn't denounced the Russians. He hasn't talked about getting to the bottom of this. He hasn't talked about how the United States should respond. 

Another rule is, if you know there is something bad out there, you try to put it out on your own terms in the first place, but as you mentioned, if you don't know it in the first place, you can't put that out to begin with. Eric, let's talk about this circle of Russian contact. Karen mentioned it obviously is wider than just Jeff Sessions. How wide is that circle right now? 

Well, we're learning more every day about Trump campaign people who had contacts with Russian officials. Jeff Sessions was the big one this week. Michael Flynn two weeks ago was fired for not being candid about his relations with the same ambassador, with Kislyak, during the transition. We're hearing more names, Carter Page was another, Gordon. As Karen said, drip, drip, drip, that is certainly the daily impact of all this. It's notable I think, mostly, because of all the denials from the White House, from Trump himself and his aides that there have been any contacts. They have been categorical for weeks even before the inauguration, in saying there were no contacts, period. This is fake news, this is a ruse. Now you have these contacts coming out which, for instance, Jeff Sessions explains as nothing insidious. There is always, you know, the axiom in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime if they had been more forthright and perhaps if the White House had known, as Karen suggests, that these contacts had happened, they could have gotten out ahead of it. Now it looks like they were denying something that is now turning out to be true. 

We've all seen these pictures of Sergey Kislyak now, right, all over the place? Tell me a little bit about him, if you could, Eric. 

He is a long-time Washington presence. He has been the ambassador to Washington for nine, ten years. He is known for throwing excellent parties, cognac, et cetera, and he knows how to work Washington in terms of going to Washington events, inviting prominent people, current ambassadors, past ambassadors, future ambassadors from the U.S. to the embassy, also to the Russian version of Camp David outside Maryland where he hosts some fabulous parties. The last few months with all the talk about Russia's meddling in the election has made him, a little bit of, I don't want to say quite persona non grata, but has caused a little bit of a chill with people being less willing to socialize or take meetings with him. And Jeff Sessions has now found that out himself. 

Karen, the word "spy" is thrown around. I know the Russians push back on that severely. How do we describe what Sergey Kislyak's role and job is? 

Well, certainly the rumors have long been out there that he is either a spy recruiter or obviously gathering intelligence himself. Let's face it, that is, in fact, part of an ambassador's job is to learn as much as possible. So you're right, the Russians are pushing back against that. They're saying he is, you know, a topnotch diplomat, not a spy. But again, this has been sort of the reputation he has had in, especially in intelligence circles in Washington. 

I don't think it matters whether he is really a covert spy and there have been denials he probably isn't, but he is outwardly gathering intelligence. He doesn't have to sneak around in the shadows in alleys. He is meeting with prominent Washington people and he's no doubt passing reports back to Moscow that end up in the hands of intelligence agencies about. Hey, I just met with Senator Sessions who is the key foreign policy advisor for the Republican nominee. Whether he is officially a spy or not is almost irrelevant, I think. 

Also to that point Eric, part and parcel of his job is meeting with lawmakers, whatever side of the aisle they're on and whether that contact is inappropriate or not. 

Well look, the question we we're all asking in Washington is whether these contacts were evidence of something more sinister, was there collusion, is the word that the Democrats keep using. Was there just contact which, of course, had been denied for a long time, or was there some more active engagement during the election season, when, remember, the Russians were actively hacking into the DNC e-mails and John Podesta's e-mails and giving those to WikiLeaks and doing serious harm to the election. Was there anyone in the Trump campaign that knew about or was involved in that effort? That is the ultimate question here. 

Because, Karen, the one Kislyak-Sessions meeting in particular in September was at the very end and in the primary heat of this campaign, correct? 

Yeah, but I really think that, you know, had he been forthright about this in his confirmation hearing when he was, after all, under oath, had he been forthright about this, had he said, you know, I had this meeting, but it was just in the course of my duties as a senator and we talked about foreign policy, it might have caused a stir for a day or two. The real damage right now is being done by the fact that he said there had been no contacts, and then he had come back and tried to parse his sentence and claim that he said something he didn't which is that there had been no communications about the campaign. That is not what he said. 

Because, Eric, he has two issues, he has the testimony and the written response. 

Sure, and I was at the press conference yesterday and I asked him directly, did the campaign or Trump's name come up? And he said, well, I don't recall, which is never a good line in Washington and he said, well, you know, these ambassadors gossip about politics and it was the middle of the campaign but I don't specifically recall politics being discussed and that, to be honest, seemed like a somewhat evasive answer. 

Karen? 

I know, especially at that time in Washington, you know, basically, people were discussing the election with strangers on the subway. 

Karen, one can understand why the administration would push back against a potential special prosecutor. It happened to Bill Clinton and resulted in his impeachment. What might the time frame be or where are the swells going as far as any potential special prosecutor involved in the Russian investigation? 

Well, first of all, there is no law now that allows the kind of independent counsels that we saw during the Clinton administration, the independent counsel statute has expired, so it could not be, again, the kind of sweeping wide-ranging, you don't know where this is going kind of investigations that we saw in the late '80s and in the '90s. But it's just really hard to say where it goes. If these kinds of revelations keep coming on a daily and sometimes practically an hourly basis, there is going to be something. By the way, that isn't the only model we have. I mean, there is also the possibility that the president himself might want to call for something, some sort of commission headed under bipartisan respected leadership, the way that Ronald Reagan did for instance as Iran Contra was breaking, the way that George W. Bush did after 9/11 when there were growing questions about, you know, what had happened to allow the attacks, what could we do to prevent them in the future? There's an argument, you know, that I think that could be made that perhaps the president should step out here and say, look, you know, if in fact -- you know, we need to get to the bottom of whether this is a threat to our security and what we should do about it. 

Eric for Democrats right now, Russia is the first, second, and third plan of attack. 

Absolutely. They obviously thought that Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the case was not enough. They've called for his outright resignation. They called for an investigation into possible perjury in what he told the judiciary committee. They obviously can make some political hay out of this for quite a long time, and having been on the defensive now for as long as they have, I think you clearly see them seizing that. 

Karen, this obviously is the big story that's consumed much of the end of this week, at least, a week that started, relatively speaking, on pretty positive terms for the president after his speech on Tuesday night. From your reporting and what you've seen there, how much disappointment and frustration is there from the White House right now that the week that they had and the positive notes they had have sort of turned sour? 

I think there is a great deal of frustration, not only from the White House but from their Republican allies on Capitol Hill, because, you know, one of the antidotes to all of this is for the president to be seen governing, for the conversation in Washington to switch from this to his policy agenda. And, you know, if so many of those initiatives weren't running into trouble on Capitol Hill, that might actually happen, and that was what he was trying to do with his speech earlier this week. 

Eric, what can we anticipate? Whether it is this story or the tentacles that come from it over the weekend and into next week? 

Well, I think there probably will be more revelations in the media as there have been all this week. Next week, I think the focus will be, somewhat surprisingly, on the confirmation hearing for the deputy attorney general, the U.S. attorney in Maryland, Rob Bornstein, who will be overseeing this investigation now that Sessions has recused himself, so that will turn into a somewhat unexpected event over Russia, because now that has landed in his lap and he is about to come up for confirmation. So I think that will be the immediate focus. You will see ongoing calls from Democrats, and even from some Republicans like Jason Chaffetz and Congressman McCarthy for further action. The Republicans called for recusal which they now got, but, you know, I think the public in general wants answers. I think there is an awful lot of confusion out there and an awful lot of unanswered questions as to what really happened, and you see people wanting to get to the bottom of that as best you can. 

And Karen, the Twitter countdown clock has been reset, right, with the president's talk of Democrats and what he considers their obstruction on his appointees? 

You know, I think that is true, as well, although he now finally does have a cabinet. 

Are there lessons to be learned, Eric, from how the appointment process has taken and those who have moved relatively smoothly through it versus those who've had very rough times and in some cases withdrawing, are there lessons to be learned for the Trump administration or future administrations for that matter? 

Well, I think the confirmation process has obviously become much more adversarial than it ever was before, partly that's because of the growing gridlock in Washington the last few years, partly that's because of President Trump and the feelings he engenders in Democrats. You know, we used to, you know, four or five administrations ago, you would routinely get cabinet nominees approved 97-0 or 98-1. That ain't happening anymore, and we're now seeing straight party line votes, much more contention hearings, questions about the honesty now of three of Trump's nominees and statements that they gave in their confirmation hearings and things that turned out to be untrue. So it's become, you know, much more political theater and really hand-to-hand combat than it ever was before. 

Eric Lichtblau from "The New York Times," Karen Tumulty from "The Washington Post," we appreciate both of your time. 

Great to be here. 

Thank you, pleasure. 

"How the Hell Did This Happen?" That's the title of the newest book by political satirist and author P.J. O'Rourke. The subtitle of that book -- "The Election of 2016." It is a no-holds-barred look at the presidential campaign, an across-the-aisle examination and critique of the candidates, the press, political punditry and even an analysis of how he, a diehard Republican, ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton. P.J. O'Rourke joins us from New Hampshire. I'm pleased to welcome him to this program. P.J., thank you for being here. 

You are very welcome. Thank you for having me. 

Thank you for being there, I should say. Let me start with this. You say, if my book lacks a coherent narrative, it's because I couldn't find one. Have you found one yet? 

Yeah, I looked everywhere. I looked behind the couch. I looked in all the places where I usually leave my cell phone. No, the coherent narrative wasn't there. Well, that is not really true. We're in the midst of a world-wide sort of populist rebellion would be maybe putting too strong a term on it, but there is a worldwide sort of -- well, let's call it a rebellion. Brexit is part of it. The neo-Maoism in China is part of it, Putin is part of it. As I point out in the book, even the politics of Australia -- now, the politics of Australia are so dull that the name of the conservative party is the liberal party. 

Yes. 

But they have had five Prime Ministers in six years. So all over the world there is some sort of discomfort with the elites, rebellion against the establishment going on, manifesting itself in various different ways, and here it manifested itself in a rather baffling man, who's now the president. 

A big part of this, rebellion is the populism and a lot of the book is very funny, but you take a more serious look at populism at the end of the book. What do you make of it? 

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. It really does. Populism can end up being sort of William Jennings Bryan incompetent and kind of funny and comic, or it can end up the way it did so many places between World War I and World War II, it can wind up really, really ugly. I'm hoping we're having, you know, history occurs first as tragedy and then again as comedy. I hope that is what's going on at the moment, but I'm not laughing really hard. 

What do you make of the president at the moment right now, this speech to a joint session of congress got so much attention earlier this week? People said he appeared more presidential. Did you sense a shift or do you sense a shift? 

Well, you know, he is a good actor. I mean, one thing -- again, I talk about it in the book, no journalist ever watched "The Apprentice." And that's not because we're smart, it's not because we're sophisticated, it's not because this is below us, it's because we're in the media, and none of us need to hear "you're fired" ever again. I mean, we all know what the state of the media is like. So we hadn't watched him on "The Apprentice." If you watch him on "The Apprentice," you realize Alec Baldwin has got nothing on the Donald Trump that Donald Trump does, he is a good actor. So whatever you call that, the address to joint -- state of the union except you don't know what the state of the union is because you've only been there a week, address. He was acting like a president. You know, doing a pretty good job of it. What that means, if anything, I don't know. 

You started to put together this book, or, you put together this book, it's more just a collection of what you observed during the campaign and, obviously, that changed very quickly from week to week and from day to day. In the end, you did endorse, as we said -- by the way, off the top, we said that you're a die-hard Republican, I'd say the better term is libertarian and has been for a long time. 

Yes, I'm a libertarian but it's been a long time since I voted for anybody but a Republican. 

But you did endorse Hillary Clinton this time and went through a long discussion of how little you think of her yet you still ended up endorsing her. And by the way, that's been the case for a long, long time as well. Do you have regrets about that? 

No, no I don't. I did it for -- you know, one of the things about libertarianism, is your political attitude is supposed to be based on reason. There is something in the financial market you probably know about called the volatility index, the VIX. You can actually go into the commodities market and buy a prediction on how volatile markets will be. It's called the fear index, and my fear index was, and I think rationally, quite high with Trump. I just felt the man was opaque to me, I didn't know what he was going to do. I disagree with Hillary about practically everything. I think I said in my endorsement, Dorothy and Toto's house fell on her, and I still endorse her, the munchkins endorse her. I knew what I was getting with her. We had eight years of Barack Obama, a kindred, more likable kindred spirit with Hillary. We survived those eight years. We would survive another four. I think four would probably be all it would be, because Americans tend to shift parties after eight, or at the max, 12 years. So I figured we lived through eight years of Obama without terrible damage, and we could live through four of hers. Whereas with Trump, might be ok, who knew, you know. I was talking to a friend of mine in the commodities business about the VIX, about the volatility index, I said, you've got all these Greek letters and formulas and stuff about measuring volatility and measuring risk. He said, P.J., let me tell you a secret, if you could measure risk, it wouldn't be risk. 

That is very true. America does volatility, I think, very well though, no matter where you come down. I wonder -- you flay pretty much every candidate who was running for office in this last election cycle, maybe other than Rand Paul, who didn't last for too, too long -- I wonder if -- 

No he didn't, I did like Rand, yeah. 

I wonder if you were impressed by anyone other than Rand, or more importantly I think, if you're future casting here, whether you see anyone in the future who you can get behind? 

Yes, actually, there were a couple of people that I thought were fine. I went to see Jeb Bush at a town hall meeting, really intimate, little town Peterborough, New Hampshire, close to where I live. Only a couple hundred people were there. He was excellent. He was truly excellent and completely believable. I went to another one in the same town with Kasich. I thought he was very solid. I don't see those guys coming back for another try. Marco Rubio, aside from not looking old enough to drive, I mean, I saw him actually where I'm sitting at the moment at St. Ansilum's College in Manchester, New Hampshire, again, fairly small crowd, he was very good. He had a kind of contentious crowd, and he was very reasonable, patient, brief and yet substantive in the way that he answered questions. I think he just needs a little more time in the -- a little more aging time in the old oaken barrel. He was good -- I heard him today on "Is Jeff Sessions a secret agent of SMERSH" question, or whatever it was. And Rubio had a good, measured reply about that, about how we want the truth, and we don't want a partisan truth, we want the truth-truth. 

You also say in the book, P.J., you talk about how it may very well be a long time -- even though we've sort of dealt with these controversies that have come up every single day, it's been an active time for the punditry and everyone else over this past six weeks. I wonder -- but you also say it's going to take a little while for all this to play out. How long do you think and when might we be able to assess all that's happened in the last two years? 

When a new president comes into office, things are always some degree of a mess. Then there is sort of extra partisanship that comes through. Usually it's in the form of a honeymoon. Stories from the first month or so of Obama's, I seem to recall repeated reports of his walking on water and so on. But actually even George W. Bush was -- I can remember somebody saying something positive about Dan Quayle right at the very beginning of George H.W. Bush's. So, you know, this is a little unusually negative, but the truth is, the beginning of all administrations are a mess. I mean, we certainly have to give it 100 days. And this is a particularly incoherent -- I mean, one of the things that bother me about having Donald Trump as president is that it seems to be absolutely intellectually incoherent and ideologically incoherent. People are all bothered about Steve Bannon as the ideological force behind the Trump administration. Well, there is no such thing as an ideological force behind an administration that has absolutely no ideology. So, you know, maybe after 100 days, we get a clearer idea of whether, like, the office and the institution suck him in and make him behave in a more or less normal fashion. 

But you don't think Bannon, for example, whether you agree with it or not, that he does have that -- that view that is a little more ideological. 

I'm not seeing a man -- you know, he's ideological, but I'm not seeing a man in Trump that listens a lot. I'm just -- you know, I just -- he has a pretty narcissistic personality. I have to say, I have trouble figuring out what -- it's like Trump is looking so closely in the mirror that when we look at Trump, we're looking at the back of the mirror. We're not really -- I don't feel like I have any sense of knowing this guy. I mean, you sort of know him because he's the guy that's on the last stool in the bar between you and the men's room and you're kind of like inclined to hold it because you don't want to have to go past that guy, the guy that's like sometimes funny, always loud, sometimes has a point, sometimes is really off the reservation, but is always going on. This is interesting because Trump does not drink, so how he got the position as the guy at the end of the bar, I'm not positive. But he's a pretty opaque character. 

You make a pretty striking comment about that. I think it's the last line of the book, which I don't want to spoil for anyone, but it's worth checking out. I want to return to this notion of elitism which has been discussed so much and populism. You also say in the book, you say, individual freedom is about bringing things together, politics is about dividing things up. This is not a new concept. 

Yes, I mean, that's what makes -- 

Yes, but it seems pretty important right now. 

Yes, that's my fundamental -- the reason I am basically a libertarian, I am a conservative, but my ideology is libertarian because I worry about big government. And I think we have a perfect example here for everybody across the spectrum. I worry, you know -- I watch liberals build a bigger and bigger government, and now I'm watching them when somebody else has gotten behind the wheel of this monster truck government, turned it around and run them down with it, you know, and they're all shocked and weepy. And I'm going, like, make it a kiddie car, you know, shrink the size of the monster truck. Then at worst, it smacks you in the shins. So, yeah, I think private individuals are a creative force and what politics basically does is take the fruits of our creation and redistribute them. And I don't mean that as an attack on the welfare system. I mean, military spending is a form of redistribution, too. Even infrastructure, which we're in no doubt in need of in this country, that is a form of redistributing the fruits of individual enterprise. And, you know, we don't want none of that, but we have to be careful about the size of the device we create to do that job. 

Well, you mentioned the big dig a couple times in the book in Boston which obviously is a project which ended up costing a lot more, I spent a lot of time in Boston, and took a lot longer than people expected, but you would agree that some infrastructure reconstruction is needed. 

Yes, it is. Although in the case of Boston, I remember when they built the expressway that the big dig replaced, and I was about college-aged and going out and visiting friends who were obviously smarter than I was because they were going to a college in Boston and not Ohio. So, I remember when that thing went up, and it should have never been built in the first place. You know, infrastructure is not like just a simple good. It's what you build and where you build it and how well you budget maintenance of the thing, is, you know, really needs to be carefully analyzed. 

P.J., I want to ask you about, what do you make of the media versus Trump, whether it's real or not or manufactured to any extent or is it theater, is it -- I mean, why, in your estimation is the president sort of taking the approach he is and what do you think the appropriate response should be from the media's side? 

Well, there is, you know, always in the media's relationship with the whole world, always an adversarial side. I mean, nobody wants to go to a play with no drama in it or see a movie with no tension in it. I mean, it's part of our job to stir the pot, you know. It's like I always say about plays and movies, is that I won't go see a play without a sword fight or a movie without a car chase. So part of media opposition to Trump is simply the natural order of things. You can get real serious about it and say we're speaking truth to power. I think that's getting a little -- we're getting a little above ourselves when we do that because that's easy. I mean, Xi Jinping, you stink -- it's easy for me to speak truth to power as long as I'm far enough away from the power. But then there is also an aspect that has happened in the media that makes Trump I think harder for media people to understand than maybe he would have been a century ago, which is, once upon a time, being like a newspaper reporter or even as relatively recently as me starting out, still a blue-collar trade. I mean, if you grew up like I did, kind of shanty Irish, you know, and if you didn't want to get up early in the morning or lift heavy things, you could essentially be a newspaper reporter or a priest. (LAUGHTER) I mean, you could be a cop, but then you would get shot at, or a fireman and that's dangerous, you know. But if you like to read, you didn't like to lift heavy things, so -- and then, you know, over the years -- I blame Nixon for this. Nixon was at fault for a lot of things, but you know, when Watergate came along and all the president's men, a whole bunch of people who should have joined the peace corps became newspaper reporters instead in order to save the world. I don't think we've ever recovered from that problem. 

P.J., you have a couple of teens, a couple of young kids, at least. You mentioned them a couple of times in the book. 

Yes. 

From their perspective, I know you paid attention to that, what do you think that generation makes of what has happened here? 

Well, it's interesting. My 19-year-old is at college, and I'm sure this has something to do with being 19. I mean, what she is most interested in is women's rights issues, specifically abortion. I mean, she sees that as fundamental. And I think that that's been a terrible mistake from the conservative side for quite a while. I mean, I am personally opposed to abortion, morally opposed to abortion, but I think it's a very, very private choice. 

On that note, P.J. O'Rourke, the book is called How The Hell Did This Happen: The Election of 2016. Very good to see you, sir. 

You're very welcome. 

I'm Molly Haskell, author of the book Steven Spielberg: A Life in Films, filling in for Charlie Rose. Agnes Varda is here. She is a filmmaker, documentarian, photographer, and visual artist. Her work in the 1950s and '60s helped pioneer the French New Wave film movement. She's in New York for an art exhibition at the Blum &amp; Poe Gallery on East 66th Street. "Agnes Varda: Life As Art," a special event presented by Rendezvous with French Cinema will take place on Friday, March 10th, at the Film Society at Lincoln Center in honor of Varda's work. I am pleased to have Agnes Varda at this table for the first time. Welcome, Agnes. 

Hello, Molly. 

It is so great to see you. We go back a very long way. You told me ahead of time not to say how long so I won't. Your show is incredible. The first room I went into has a huge photograph of the ocean. Then there is a film of the ocean rip -- of the waves rippling and there's a sound track, and there's something, I guess it's canvass, it's almost like sand. You're absolutely -- it's a transporting moment. 

It is real sand. 

It is real sand, yes. 

I wanted a representation of the seaside and something reality that you know is there. 

You always combine -- you somehow manage to combine -- I mean, this goes back a long way, but the documentary and the imaginary in one. 

Yes. 

It is the most -- I mean, people assume that nobody wanted to leave. It needs a bigger room because people are just absolutely fixated. 

Because it's based on contemplation. 

Calm. 

And calm, and, you know, we're in a world moving so much. 

Yes. 

And films and everything is so much action that I propose the peaceful total look, contemplating something that we all know and all love in a way, the seaside. And it's not tempest -- 

No, it's a quiet ocean, isn't it? Is the soundtrack actually from that particular ocean or is it-- 

It's mental. We all know what is the feeling being near the sea when it's calm. 

Yes. 

And we hear the... It's something that everybody can feel wherever they have seen it or felt it. So, the piece is called "Seaside" and I'm impressed because people sit and they stay. 

They can't leave it. 

That's nice. 

It's absolutely mesmerizing. And in the next room, you have something that reminded me a little bit of Chris Marker who was one of your colleagues in the early days of film making. The picture, a 1955 photograph, and then you've recreated it as a drama alongside. 

I've always been interested in images. The frame of image. What is on the right, but also what is an image, if you -- is it snapshot -- you come, you see people. 

And family. 

Maybe people you never met that you see somewhere. And I always questioned who are they? How did they happen to be together at the same place? Do they know each other? Did they know each other? And so I made a kind of screenplay that could be possible about these unknown people, where character is fiction. 

That's wonderful. 

It is just always using my imagination, but asking the people who look at the images to wake up their own imagination because each image is a mystery. Even things that we know what it is. 

And you use local actors and gave them a script? 

Oh, no, no. It's people, I like them to come into my art project. 

Just ordinary people. 

Oh, my neighbor. 

Yes. 

This one is the plumber of my village. 

The plumber, yes. 

And his mother and another woman who is a teacher. But I will say, would you like to come into my dream becoming a film? And they say yes, and I told them what I felt. And they became what I was feeling. 

Yes. 

And I've done that very often. But this is not the documentary. When I do a documentary, I respect their own life, their own world, and that's what I have been doing recently. You know, I just finished a feature documentary with J.R., the artist J.R., and we did together a trip in France in some villages, some small villages, and we met people. And together, we asked them to speak about what they feel, what they see, and then we make sometimes big images of them and I make them, they have worth and (speaking French). 

The value, the worth? 

Value, their worth, them be the star but the star has no meaning. 

This is like the Gleaners one, that was the first one where you scavenged, sort of scavenger, discovery of cast-off things, right, things that nobody pays attention to? 

Nobody listens to the gleaners. The same I did the work on "The Widows." Nobody listened to the widows, supposedly boring. And now, when I did that thing, we were in villages where people were working or a girl was serving in a bar and people working in a factory where there was a lot of danger, we asked these people to be with us, and we built some strange things. In the harbor, we used the container to make a Lego construction. 

Yes. 

You know, we tell them we want to be artists with them and they help us. 

They collaborate. 

Yes to collaborate, they help, they get involved. They like to feel that they have the right to be artists with us. 

Yes. 

Because it not --- I'm not untouchable, you know. 

You've always had this decentralized sense of film, as belonging, something that's not just something handed down and imposed on people but they bring to you. Even in something like "Vagabond," that wonderful film you made. 

That's a fiction. 

I know it's a feature film, but even so, the idea of different people, it's a young girl played by Sandrine Bonnaire, who's found dead, and you have different people giving their perspective on that. 

Real people. 

Real people, yes. 

But you see in the installation that I'm showing at Blum &amp; Poe right now, I'm very excited because some of these people have been reenacting a still photo. They were people I met again. No actors at all. I say, look at that image. We try to imitate it. We bought a dress to the woman acting looking like the dress in the picture. We will act, we will play, we are doing that picture, and they play the game with us. 

Everybody because it's like family photographs on vacation, it's something everybody's taken and they look back at them and they wonder and try to remember what was going on before and after, why is he holding the baby now. 

Yes, but in families, they know each other, I'd like to have unknown people together and say -- 

They weren't a family at all. 

Well, no. Does it make history, could we believe that something happened between this one and this one. 

Yes. 

So, I think I have my imagination, not I wouldn't say working, but alive all the time. 

Well, I think even if something like "Les Creatures," where a guy is a writer and it's a little bit the same thing, where the people in the village become imaginary people. You have the this sense of no boundaries between the real and the imaginary. 

You know, reality is so difficult. 

Yes. 

It's so tough. The whole world is an incredible difficult reality. So, if we can reinvent reality, make it more sensible, more near us, so it makes sense that we share with them something, stories or emotion or spectacle, something, not only entertainment but having fun together. 

Because you realize, especially with the politics now, a lot of people feel left out. They feel they're people at the artistic center of the world and these other people who are just nobodies. And you somehow give them the feeling they aren't nobodies, and you've always known that. 

In the center of French cinema, which is very strong and has become sort of more known at the time like New Wave, but now we have a lot of new directors and women directors, a lot of them came here with the French cinema today, event. 

I met you when you came. I was 65, and I just started at the French film office, and it was "Le Bonheur," but before that, you made "Cleo from 5 to 7," the story of a pop singer who is waiting for a diagnosis that she may have cancer, and it was really a kind of feminist film (speaking French) because, you know, so many French films are women walking, beautiful male directors, and these beautiful kind of woman, girls on the cusp of womanhood and they're there for the pleasure of the male who is looking. 

No, you make it too much. 

No, I think that French cinema has a lot of those, kind of women walking and -- 

No, some men when will make film in which they try to understand what is the essence of a woman. 

But yours is a woman whose mind you're interested in and sensibilities. 

I was trying to find this radical way of doing cinema -- more than telling that story and another one, trying to make the cinema, like other art moved, you know, painting had moved, literature had moved, and cinema was still telling stories like coming from a book or from a place. 

You use the phrase, cine-writing. 

Yes because I want to cinema -- or from the inspiration that is there in real life, and then, from real life, inventing a shape of touching people. I like to -- I don't want them to cry, to scream, to be afraid. I'm against a film in which -- 

Melodrama, yes. 

-- the killer, is he behind the door? Okay, very good films are made like this, a lot of beautiful films, but I like to work on something which is sensible in which maybe the people watching the film get to feel what is presented, what is proposed. So I have been doing the life of a photographer, then the life of a filmmaker, then I switch from an old filmmaker to a young visual artist. Then in the last ten years, I have been doing mostly installations, exhibitions, using all photographs, mixing them with video, trying to reconciliate, you know, (inaudible) and digital -- 

It's wonderful, "The Beaches of Agnes," you go back, and you're not even a beach person, and yet, you have these wonderful installations and movies about beaches, but you find a picture of two young boys and then you find that they're now old men and you bring them to that, I think, I mean, that's -- 

When we met, Molly, we were young persons. (LAUGHTER) This was a long time ago. 

It was. 

And what we still share is love for movies, love for experimentation, adventure, because trying to invent cinema, and you do a work by reading, understanding, sharing what you know and what you understood about cinema, sharing it with people who go to movies, that's what you were. 

And I knew Jacques, your husband, and you knew my husband, Andrew, my film critic husband, and so we both had marriages in which love and movies were intertwined. And so I think we had a tremendous rapport on that level and you made the wonderful movie about Jacques and his dying -- one thing I want -- have you seen and have you heard about "La La Land?" 

Oh, my God. 

Because it is very much a tribute, in many ways a tribute to Demy. 

I must say that Damien Chazelle -- 

Chazelle, the director. 

When he speaks about the film, he pays tribute to Jacques Demy himself. 

He does, yes. 

In France, he came and said, when he saw "Umbrellas of Cherbourg," was 17 and it changed his life. He decided to become a filmmaker. 

Yes. 

And you know what we did when he came to Paris, he invited us and said, can I come at your place? And being in the courtyard where I had been living with Jacques, he felt so touched, I mean, like a kid, you know, I said, okay, you've done a film, come on, don't be so -- He said because Jacques Demy has been so important in my life, so you understand that listening to this makes my heart beat. 

Incredible. 

I said what a nice boy. 

The effect that you and your fellow New Wave directors had in the '60s and early '70s on American film making is just indescribable and you must know that. I remember when you came over with "Le Bonheur" and Mike Nichols came. Do you remember the screening and I was there? I was interpreting and your English wasn't as great as it is now. And Mike Nichols was there and he was so moved by it. Do you remember that? You were part of the Left Bank group, right? That distinction that was you, Alain Resnais, and Chris Marker, the sort of intellectuals, and Jacques Demy. 

We were on the left side of politics also. 

On the left politics. 

And we lived on the left side of the river, which was very strange. 

It is strange when you think about it and then Godard, Truffaut, and Chabrol were considered the Right Bank, they were movie maniacs, and they were the ones that sort of came up on Americans and very influenced by Americans, although Resnais also. 

It has been a time of very, very incredible -- 

Creativity. 

Like spring, like flowers open -- 

You kept going, this is what I can't get. I mean, it's almost like you've had ten careers. You've kept going with the same curiosity and creativity now for all these years and just going in whatever direction drew you. 

I am lucky to have kept that, to use it, that desire to experiment something, and at this exhibition that I show at Blum &amp; Poe, I never had the experience to put the seaside on the 5th floor. 

Yes. 

And so people forget they're in New York, forget they have to go to the 5th floor -- 

That's right. You go up in a tiny elevator and you go into this little room and suddenly the room just opens up. 

And that's what we need. I'm here in an exhibition that makes me very happy because I see people coming, people who love films, people who love art, and the young people. 

They were all young people yesterday. What is gonna happen with the "Rendezvous?" What happens on March 10th? What is that? 

Oh, they asked me to -- I don't remember the date but they do. 

Yes. 

They ask me -- I will present (speaking French). 

(speaking French), yes. 

Then I will present (speaking French). 

(speaking French). 

Yes, and then I will speak with Melissa Anderson about my work. Because I come to New York, they grab me and say you have to do this and this and this. Next time, I won't tell nobody, I won't say that I come. 

Don't tell anybody. 

Because now I'm on program. 

Program, well. 

About a program was a delight for me to see you again. 

It's so great. You're just an inspiration. I was sort of flagging and I went to the show and I thought, my God, if she can do it, I got to do something. I mean, it was just wonderful. 

Are you about to become also a visual artist? 

I don't think so, but I'm soaking up yours, and I can't wait to see what you do next. 

I feel happy that it happens -- as I said yesterday, it's the last part of my life. 

Yes. 

And so much good -- so many good things happened to me. I work, I do a lot, but there is an answer to that. There is an answer from the people coming to see. 

The content and also the people that you're making films with, you're sort of collaborators, I mean the energy that comes back and forth between you and them, it's a glorious thing. 

If the energy can be shared and the emotion and sometimes the jokes and spirit, I think we -- 

And humor, too. I think people don't talk as much as about your humor. Even in the photographs, I noticed in the show, there's a kind of sly humor in them. And you're a very funny person. 

Well, I'm glad you've got what I'm trying to propose and it works sometimes. 

Well, congratulations. 

Thank you, Molly. It was beautiful to see you. 

You too.
