We begin with a hard look at childhood today. Growing up in America has become a dangerous proposition. In a new book, Today's Children, Dr. David Hamburg demonstrates that poverty, drug abuse, violence, and more, have made our children a nation at risk. The president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Dr. Hamburg has written a prescription to address the very roots of our child development crisis, and we're very pleased to have him here with us this evening. Welcome. Pleasure. 

Thank you for having me here. 

Thank you for coming. Tell me why are our children at risk and what are the consequences of that risk? 

Well, there are many sources, but in the book I try to sketch out one set of risk factors, enormous changes in families and communities in the past 30 years or so. On the one hand, the very young, socially isolated, very poor mothers struggling to raise children all alone or with minimal resources. On the other hand, in the more affluent sector, huge changes in the divorce rates, women entering the workforce, a great boon for this society, and yet very little compensation from fathers or grandparents in terms of time with children, so that overall the time parents spend with children has dropped about half in the past 30 years, and many other things like that have happened, so the experience of growing up now is rather different than it was a few decades ago. That poses a great problem for this society. 

Why has it come to that? 

There are large social historical factors at work that are really hard to understand. We have a traditional emphasis on individualism in this society which is very good for us in a lot of ways, and yet we seem to have gotten very weak on the kind of mutual aid ethic. It's hard to think about a country as large as ours as a single extended family, but in a way that's what we are. We're all in one big leaky boat together, and somehow or other, society now is beginning to address what are the conditions under which kids can grow up in good shape. 

Yeah, but you think we have lost the sense of community? 

To some extent, I think we have, and very thoughtful people are working on that problem, John Gardner, for example. We have had an erosion of the sense of community, and we have to find some way to put that back together again. 

Why is it a country that is as rich as we are, in certain areas of childcare and perhaps more, stands in the lower fourth in the world in comparison to other industrialized nations? 

It is very puzzling. You know, Charlie, if you look at many indices in health and education, our casualties are a lot higher than the Europeans, or the Japanese, or the Canadians. 

Stop there. Is it because of value- -- Well, give me the facts. Give me the evidence in terms of how alarming the numbers are. 

Well, for example, if you look at infant mortality, which is important in itself, how many infants-- What's the rate at which infants die in the first year of life, it's kind of a proxy for a lot of other things a society does. 

Sure. 

How civilized is the society is to some extent measured by that, and we've been running through the '80s, 20th, 25th in the world, in that range, but it's not just a problem of let's say the inner city, because if you just take, let's say, the white only population, we run maybe 15th or so in the world. It's not terrific. 

But is it because of then -- Having those alarming numbers, why? Is there a lack of will, a lack of commitment, a lack of recognition, a lack of -- Because you make very clear that there is, in a sense, in this country, if we are to raise our childcare, it is not a question of just resources. It's not a question of just money. In the book, you cite very well that it is, in a sense, we have to adapt more of a selfless attitude towards children, and some people will have to act perhaps not in their immediate self-interest. 

Well, that's right. In general the European countries and Canada and Japan have a stronger mutual aid ethic with respect to children as a major social commitment, for example, that to the extent humanly possible, every woman will get prenatal care early, and the prenatal care will to some extent include education about caring for herself and the baby and what she's going to do with the rest of her life, and to some extent include kind of social support toward health and education for her and for her children, kind of a two-generation benefit, you know. We have some of that, but not nearly as much as they do. Maybe it's partly because we are so big, we are so heterogeneous, it's kind of hard to get a sense of identification with that great mass of people. 

Can we measure -- I want to talk about adolescence in a moment, but can we measure the notion of the impact for the early child of one parent? 

Well, there's an enormous amount of variation. Clearly one parent, a devoted, committed, resourceful, coping parent, can raise children very effectively, but it's hard. 

And in many ways is better than two bad parents. 

Well, yeah, absolutely, but on the average-- 

Right, uncaring parents. 

--Over the entire population, it's harder for one person to do it than the two, or two with a backup. In many ways, an ideal situation is a cohesive family with both parents there, and with some grandparents or aunts or uncles around so that in a crunch there are lots of people to help out, there are lots of sources of ideas and information and context. It's much harder to do it alone, but it can be done. 

What about the sense of adolescence now as the second most crucial period, that time I guess, between what, nine? What ages? 

We focus on about 10 and 15, early adolescence. 

10 and 15, yeah. 

It's a fascinating time, marked by the big changes in the body, the changes of puberty, and the kids are sort of asking, "What's happening to me? What's happening to my body? What am I going to become?" But that biological change, which in a way is the largest biological upheaval in the whole lifespan, roughly coincides with a big social upheaval, the move from elementary to junior high or middle school, which typically is from a small, neighborhood school to a big impersonal warehouse type of operation. Those two things coming in conjunction makes it a very interesting and stressful time. 

Yeah, you make a point that junior high should be abolished. 

Well, that's my personal inclination. 

All right, but let me hear that. 

If not abolished, drastically changed anyway. 

Because? 

Well, at the core of it is that it's really essential to have sustained, individual attention in a constructive mode, and so many of our junior high schools now are way too big and too impersonal, and kids kind of get lost in there. Now you can do it by breaking up the big schools into small units, and there are some schools in New York like that, a school within a school or a house, whatever you want to call it. That's one aspect. There are other aspects of it, but another feature is you really need to have that education specifically adapted to the experiences of these kids. For example, to teach the life sciences around the principle of development, and starting with puberty is a very good way to go. Let the kids understand what's happening to them. 

Is part of the reason that we have not devoted the amount of resources, focus, national will towards children, the fact that they don't vote and they don't have political power? 

It certainly is. It's got to be a factor. They don't vote, they don't have political power. Now, you can ask why aren't their parents more aggressive in advocacy for them, and I must say that is somewhat puzzling. It seems to me there was a time when parents were more vigorous politically (inaudible) for their children, but at the moment, their political strength is weak. 

Okay. Dr. David Hamburg is here. His book is called Today's Children. It is an alarming look at some of the problems that we face in this nation, and a call for dialog with respect to the political community, and some options for creating a future for this generation which is in crisis. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
