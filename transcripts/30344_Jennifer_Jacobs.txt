We begin tonight with the re-organization at the National Security Council. Steve Bannon, chief White House strategist, has been removed from his top post on the principal's committee. His appointment to the committee in January was criticized for potentially politicizing foreign policy decision making, the shakeup also restores the director of National Intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as permanent members of the NSC. Joining me now from Washington, Jennifer Jacobs of "Bloomberg News", she broke the story. I am pleased to have her on this program. Welcome. 

Thanks, Charlie. 

How did you get this story? 

Well, some sources within the administration tipped me off to it this morning and said, hey, heads up, we've got a really big deal going on here. Now the administration, other administration officials have downplayed it little bit. And said, this is less of a powerplay, it's more just of a reshaping of a panel to the way it should have been now that Mike Flynn is gone, of course he was a national security advisor, was fired or resigned in February. And now you've got H.R. McMaster in charge and he is reshaping this panel and moving the puzzle pieces around a little bit to shape it to the way he wants it to be. 

OK. So, I mean, is this something the president had to -- obviously the president had to OK this. Did he play a hand at all as far as you know? 

Well, I was told that from the very beginning that President Trump wasn't very comfortable with having his chief political strategist having such a high-powered position on this National Security Council Principals Committee, he wasn't comfortable with it, but not so uncomfortable with it that he, you know, ordered a change right away. So, yes, of course this was all run through President Trump, the order was actually done yesterday, fairly quietly, there was no press release. No word about it. It didn't come to light until my sources told me about it this morning. 

Can you make the case that it is a loss of power for Steve Bannon? 

It is. It definitely is. He no longer is part of this executive committee, this principals committee of the National Security Council. But, listen, Charlie, not a whole lot is going to change for Steve Bannon, he wasn't going to these meetings anyway. He had the authority to go but he had not chosen to go, and he is still part of the larger National Security Council. So he actually went to an NSC meeting today, it's that larger group of like 100 or more people that, you know, so it is not part of the top, you know, the cabinet members and the top officials, it's a larger council, so he actually went today. And so, you know, he is not being excluded. I was told by three administration officials that his authority in the White House has not changed, that his influence with the President Trump has not changed, and if you look at all of the members of the inner circle no one is closer to Trump and doing more with President Trump than Steve Bannon. I mean, he tags along with him in the limo to these different meetings, and he's on Marine One and Air Force One. He'll be there in Florida for the next couple of days for, you know, the first meeting with the president of China. So Steve Bannon still has an enormous amount of influence with the president and that did not diminish. 

What about H.R. McMaster who replaced Michael Flynn? 

Yes, so this change today to the National Security Council definitely empowers him. It gives him more authority. He is now in charge of the homeland security council, he wasn't before, you know, now he is in charge of setting the meetings, where before that was Tom Bossert, you know, the homeland security advisor. So this shifts more power to McMaster. This is a win for McMaster to have this council structured the way he wants it, there is no doubt about it. But, you know, I was told it was originally Reince Priebus's, the chief of staff's idea to have Steve Bannon come on to the principals committee. It was Reince's idea, okayed by the president and others and, you know, now that McMaster is in place, I think what I was told is that with Michael Flynn there they wanted someone there to be a minder, quote, unquote, a minder to watch over him. He needed a little bit of oversight. I was told Bannon's role was to make sure that Michael Flynn got the job done. And, you know, even as far back as inauguration date, Michael Flynn was considered a little bit flaky by some in the inner circle in Trump world. And, you know, it turned out he did need a little bit of oversight. He was fired or resigned as we were talking about. So Bannon's role was to give him oversight, now that Flynn is gone, McMaster is in place, I think that Bannon and the inner circle really trust McMaster to do the right thing. He doesn't need to have someone babysitting and making sure he get the job done. He's going to get it done and get it done right. They trust him to do that. 

And the president, and I assume Steve Bannon as well, admire military people. 

Oh, yes, very much. And General McMaster has this reputation for being a truth teller. He talks to, you know, power to authority, he is not afraid to, you know, get back into the president's face and tell him if he thinks the president is doing something unwise. 

Well, he wrote a book about how everybody screwed up in Iraq. 

Yes, exactly, that's exactly right. And that's part of the reason why Trump brought him on and that's part of the reason why the inner circle likes him so much. 

So, where are we now in terms of this whole thing about Nunes coming, Devin Nunes coming to the White House and having these two staffers inside the White House show him stuff on their computer, or whatever they did, and then he goes outside and has a press conference and then goes back to tell the president what he just heard. 

Right. And that's all very strange. I know that has caused a lot of just head scratching and we're still a little bit puzzled as to, you know, how that all went down and where that's all going to wash out. We're waiting to hear, you know, more about that from, you know, Democrats and others who have had access to that material. I'm not fully up to speed on everything that's going on behind that, but I know that was just a really weird situation. As soon as Nunes hopped into that Uber and came and started doing this, you know, Inspector Gadget thing, as Lindsey Graham called it. It just raised a bunch of eyebrows. It was just very nontraditional. People started wondering if this was indeed the White House helping, you know, guide him to help bolster their case. It's just -- it's just a strange situation and I think we're just waiting for an update, you know, on what exactly, how that's going to wash out. 

Is the White House still not organized? 

Well probably not. I mean, no, it's not. I mean, even they would admit that they've got things that they would like to be a little more streamlined. They would like things to be a little bit smoother, but they're starting to get things together. They've got, you know, fallen into a pattern. Do they have things lined up for really important critical things and critical decision making on national security and other matters? No. But do they have certain things in hand? Yes. Like, for example, we heard about this big Westinghouse bankruptcy and how the White House really mobilized to try to figure out how to deal with this sale. Westinghouse, of course, is a company that builds nuclear reactors in the United States. And they have access to, they control, you know, secrets, nuclear secrets, technology, not only are they building nuclear reactors around the country, but they are also in charge of the maintenance for the current reactors. And as soon as they got the word, the White House got the word that Westinghouse on last Wednesday was declaring bankruptcy and that Chinese interests, a Chinese government backed company might be interested in purchasing it, the White House mobilized into action and they're trying to figure out what exactly, how to handle the sale, so this is just one example of, you know, the White House does seem to have certain things under control. I know they are looking for a new U.S. buyer for Westinghouse. They prepped the president just in case this comes up in the conversations with Chinese president Xi this week. So there're examples of where this White House is doing really well, but there are other parts where not so much, not hearing a whole lot about having a strategy in place for dealing with North Korea, you know. Not sure what's going to happen with Syria. I mean, there're just so many questions that have to do with national security and so many other matters where they are not organized. Another example, Terry Branstad is the nominee to be Trump's ambassador to China, and some dysfunction and disorganization in the State Department, he has not gotten through the senate nomination process yet, so he will not be there for this meeting with Chinese president Xi, which is, you know, the chance for these two, you know, world leaders to make their first impressions on each other. And who is Trump going to turn to for guidance and influence during this meeting? Well, not Terry Branstad, his new ambassador. But, you know, who will be there is Steve Bannon. (laughing) 

So the former governor of Iowa knew Xi when he came as a young man to Iowa, so there was a personal relationship there, which would be beneficial, I assume, at the kind of negotiations they're going to have. 

I would assume so. And Governor Branstad also has deep knowledge of trade, and so that's going to be something that is going to be important. And just, you know, just fostering that relationship, we've heard that one of President Trump's biggest goals for this meeting with Xi is that he really wants to just foster ties. He wants to have a rapport with Xi, and that's one of the most crucial things that can come out of this meeting. And Terry Branstad is somebody who knows Xi personally, who knows, you know, just how things work with the Xi delegation and really could work to steer Trump in the right way and foster those close ties. It is definitely an eyebrow raiser that he won't be there, but I know that Governor Branstad has chosen to stay away. He doesn't want to get in the way of the Senate process. He knows that he has not been confirmed yet, and he's not going to get in the way of that Senate process. 

What is it that the president believes that he has to come away with? 

I would say that their top goal is coming to some sort of resolution on North Korea. The vice president said it again today that if China won't help them deal with this North Korea situation, then the U.S. will take care of it. So I would say if there is one really serious deliverable that they would like to walk away from is that some sort of, you know, a strategy and a plan and a united front on dealing with North Korea. 

Jennifer, thank you for joining us. 

You're welcome.
