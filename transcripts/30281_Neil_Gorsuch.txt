We begin this evening with confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. In the first day of questioning, Judge Gorsuch emphasized his judicial independence, asked by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, if he would have any trouble ruling against the president, his answer was ready-made. 

So that's a softball, Mr. Chairman. I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party other than based on what the law and the facts in the particular case require. And I'm heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there's no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges. 

Senators pressed him on a variety of divisive issues including abortion, campaign finance, and the travel ban. Joining me now is Emily Bazelon. She is a staff writer for "The New York Times Magazine." She is a fellow at Yale Law School. And I am pleased to have her on this program. She does not teach law. What she does is even more important. She teaches lawyers, would-be lawyers, becoming lawyers, how to write. Something we all need across the board of all disciplines. 

Indeed. 

So good for you. 

Thank you. 

How did Judge Gorsuch do? 

I think he did well. He met the standard that we now hold Supreme Court nominees to, which is that he didn't flub an answer. He seemed very assured. And he also didn't give any opponents any ammunition against him, really. He was able to demonstrate great fluency in the law without providing any specifics about how he would rule that might cause trouble for him. 

Takeaways from this hearing? 

You know, I think one question is whether the Democrats have the kind of ammunition they need to justify voting against Judge Gorsuch as a person, as opposed to as a symbol of the Trump administration, or as, in the Democrats' view, the unwarranted, undeserved replacement for Merrick Garland, Obama's failed Supreme Court nomination. He's not giving them a whole lot of obvious talking points, so it will be interesting to see how that plays as they decide how to vote. And I would assume that the Republicans are feeling very good about this choice. 

He has the burden, does he, of proving that he's independent? 

He does, especially at this moment in Trump's presidency, given the FBI investigation. But it's very easy to assert one's independence with great confidence as Judge Gorsuch did today. So I think he -- you know, to the extent that words can address that question, I think he did that. 

Here is what Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts wrote in the "Boston Globe." "Anyone who believes in a neutral Supreme Court guided by equal justice for all should oppose this nomination." 

Right, so Senator Warren's responding to aspects of Judge Gorsuch's record that suggest that he's not a strong proponent of civil rights. He has ruled against workers in a number of cases, against the government requirement that companies provide contraception to female employees. He has ruled in favor of religious minorities in cases where there were significant majority rights at stake, too. And so there are indications that he is a deeply conservative judge and will be that kind of justice. 

He said to them, I am not an algorithm. What did he mean? (LAUGHTER) 

Right, I feel like each hearing serves up its own little homily or simile or metaphor. 

A remembering phrase. 

Right. He also talked about precedence, past cases as being a kind of family history for the court, which I saw as his variation on the umpire balls and strikes theme that Chief Justice Roberts sounded when he was having his confirmation hearings. 

Where do you find him on this sort of the spectrum of the Supreme Court? 

I think Judge Gorsuch will be significantly to the right. The political science analysis of his appellate court ruling suggests that he will be with Samuel Alito, perhaps to the right a bit of Chief Justice Roberts. In the place that Justice Scalia would have been in, and, of course, this is Scalia's former seat that Gorsuch is being asked to fill. 

Does he remind you of Scalia in any way? 

Temperamentally, no. I would say they're quite a contrast. Scalia kind of gloried in being provocative off the bench as well as on the bench, especially in his later years. And Gorsuch seems very tempered, composed, has a kind of gentle air about him. But I think in terms of their view of the law, and there are quite strict views about interpreting the constitution narrowly, I think there is a great deal of resemblance. 

And how does he resemble heroes of his like Justice Jackson? 

That's a good question. I mean, he would argue that he believes in judicial restraint or modesty, which means that he won't as a Supreme Court justice, he would argue go out and grab big issues to decide if they're not right in front of him. And I think it is true that as an appellate court judge, he has tried to decide cases on quite narrow ground. So if he follows that path, then that would illustrate the kind of judicial restraint he talks about. 

And Justice Whizzer White was also another hero. 

Yes, exactly. A former football hero. That's a rarity on the Supreme Court. You know, these are very safe past -- 

Appointed by President Kennedy. 

Right. And these are very safe past justices for Gorsuch to compare himself to. They're not highly conservative but they're on the conservative side of the ledger. And so what you have here are kind of touchstones from the past that signal to the Republicans that he is what they hoped for without touching off, you know, kind of a firestorm among liberals, or at least he'll hope that. 

So you suggest he's to the right. Is he -- I mean, he might have been in part where Justice Scalia was. Is he as far to the right as -- who might I say -- like who else would be over there other than Alito and Scalia... 

Well, Justice Thomas. 

Justice Thomas is the one I was thinking about. 

Yes, Justice Thomas is over there on the right, and I think there are issues on which Gorsuch would be in alignment with Thomas more than Roberts and Alito. So for example, the question of the power of the administrative state. We've had this rule since 1984 that, in general, courts defer to the judgments of federal agencies when they're trying to sort out an ambiguous statute, when they're writing rules. Judge Gorsuch has really questioned that precedent. And if he were to take that view to its logical end point on the Supreme Court, he would really tear down a lot of the authority that federal agencies have to craft rules and regulations. So for example, the EPA, there are lots of rules that the career employees at the EPA have helped craft. If that's outside of their powers, then you start sending a lot of laws back to Congress to clarify as opposed to relying on the agency to interpret them. 

Issues of war and peace? 

When Judge Gorsuch was in the Department of Justice quite briefly, he signed on to and really helped, to some degree, shape, some of the Bush administration's controversial policies. So he supported, for example, a signing statement that President Bush signed that retained his power to decide what is torture, when Congress was trying to take it away from him. On those kinds of issues, again, Gorsuch comes across as being very conservative and also a proponent of presidential power. 

And the rights of criminal defendants? 

Judge Gorsuch has been open to claims about the fourth amendment. So criminal suspects who have said that the police violated their rights to search and seizure and so their convictions should be overturned because some of the evidence against them was gathered by illegal means, Gorsuch has been interested in those kinds of claims. That is, again, a resemblance with Justice Scalia. It goes back to the original meaning of the fourth amendment and an interpretation that gives people considerable freedom from police authority. You can see it as a sort of libertarian view. But he has been quite strict about appeals from criminal defendants who are, for example, saying they were innocent or that there are, you know, claims were -- that they were -- or that there are cases that were mistried in court. 

And issues of gender equality? 

Well, I mean, he ruled against -- he ruled against the government in a case that was trying to make sure that women had broad access to contraception through the health care that their employers provide, and so, I think a lot of women's groups and pro-choice groups are concerned about him on those grounds. 

Did he say anything that surprised you? (LAUGHTER) 

I should be able to come up with something. But I can't. 

He was as expected? 

He was as expected and also -- 

And coached, probably. 

Yes, oh, absolutely. But also, to some degree, he's only partly responsible for the unsurprisingness because the hearings themselves are becoming so scripted. There are these very few moves that nominees make. They can speak with great fluency in describing cases and how the law is developed. And when pushed to say how would you decide something, something that happened in the past, then they say, well, I have to keep an open mind, I can't tip my hand. 

But most of what we know about him has to do with decisions he has made before on the appeals court. 

Yes, that's right. And one of the cases of his that came up today, which I find quite revealing, involves -- it's called the freezing trucker case -- it involves a trucker who was out on a very cold night in Montana on the highway and his truck broke down. So he called his company for help and the company said, you need to wait for the repair folks, and so, the trucker waited and waited and he started to really worry that he was freezing. He called back, it was about 3:00 in the morning, and the company gave him a choice. They said, you can either stay with your truck or you can try to drive your load with your frozen brakes. An impossibility, right? So the trucker finally gave up and went to a nearby gas station only for about ten minutes until the repairman came. But he was fired. And so there's a narrow statutory question about whether his firing was proper or not. Judge Gorsuch ruled -- and he was a dissenter -- 

This was a case on appeal, I assume. 

This is a case on appeal. It comes up after having been decided essentially by the Department of Labor. And Judge Gorsuch's colleagues sided with the trucker. Judge Gorsuch sided against the trucker. And he said at the hearing today that in some sense he regretted the ruling, not that he got it wrong, but that the law required him to side against this worker. But I would argue that that is a very narrow interpretation of the law, that actually he had a choice to make there. And so here we're seeing, weighing what he saw as a strict interpretation, but perhaps finding a strict interpretation that sided with a company over this trucker, who had, you know, a very compelling problem. 

So let me understand that. His compassion was with the trucker, but he ruled for the company. 

That is what he says, that his compassion was with the trucker, but I think if you really dive into the case, you see that he did have a choice. He could have ruled with the trucker, but he chose not to. So then that just makes me wonder about the different values and equities that he was weighing in making the decision. 

He knew that he could have ruled for the trucker and that there was a legitimate basis to rule for the trucker? 

I mean, I don't know what was in his mind. But I think that it's pretty clear from the facts in the case and the way the statute is written that he had a choice. He argued in his opinion that he did not have a choice. And one thing about Judge Gorsuch, he is an excellent writer, one of the best judges in terms of just the crafting and the quality of writing of his opinions I've ever read. 

He attended your course or something? 

Way beyond my course, forget my course. He really is an excellent writer. And so one gets caught up in his arguments. They seem inevitable. But then if you take a step back in this case and in other cases, you can see that there is another argument out there that he is kind of dismissing by making his own argument appear to be so strong. 

On the matter of what you teach, would you be advising law students that the best thing they could possibly do would be to study literature and writing as a prelude to coming to law school? 

I think it is enormously important to be a good communicator as a lawyer and that clarity of prose is undervalued in the legal profession. 

In every profession. 

In every profession but maybe especially among lawyers who start relying on jargon a lot and I would definitely encourage them to try to become better as opposed to worse writers as they join the legal profession. 

Often decisions become in terms of confirmations become caught up in personal frailties. Is there anything in terms of that that we have heard that might endanger this nomination? 

You know, really not very much. There are a couple of female law students in the University of Colorado who took a course in ethics that Judge Gorsuch gave, and they've complained that the way he talked about women getting hired and then having children in the course of which becoming eligible for maternity benefits, that his description of women kind of joining companies and then getting pregnant bothered them, made them feel like he was suggesting that women go to companies simply to get these benefits and, in essence, were trying to sort of put one over on their employers. That caused a little ripple to speak, but a whole bunch of other students defended Judge Gorsuch. And, you know, as a teacher myself, and I actually have taught ethics -- co-taught an ethics course in law school, it's really important to have a lot of room as a teacher to raise controversial hypotheticals. And so given the need for a very free give-and-take in the classroom, I don't expect this complaint to really cause trouble for him. 

You're the granddaughter of a great judge named David Bazelon, correct? 

Thank you. 

Well, who I knew, I went to law school, but of course I knew about him. You did or did not go to law school? 

I did go to law school, yes. 

And decided not to teach or to practice or decided to teach but to teach something outside of the disciplines of law? 

Right. I really love the privilege of asking questions, which journalism brings with it. 

Yes. 

So I hope that I use my legal education to frame questions or know who to call or think about connecting issues, but I decided that I wanted to do the thing that I felt like I loved the most. And for me, that's reporting and just getting to fulfill my curiosity. 

And writing, I assume. 

And writing, too, but I like the reporting part. Doesn't everyone like everything but writing the first draft? 

You suspect that he will be confirmed? 

I do, yes. I mean -- 

He'll get the necessary... 

I think so and I think if the Democrats decide to filibuster this nomination -- and they may not -- but if they do, that the Republicans will feel like it's worth it to them to break the filibuster and change the rules for confirming Judge Gorsuch. I think that this nomination is the smartest move that President Trump has made since he took office. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thanks so much for having me. 

We'll be right back. Stay with us. The debate surrounding the future of American healthcare took another contentious turn on Tuesday. President Trump addressed a group of undecided House Republicans in a closed door meeting and strongly implored them to follow through on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. This comes on the heels of revisions meant to win over conservatives, including a shift of Medicaid cost, from counties to the state government. Beginning even with the changes, passage of the House bill remains far from assured with rank-and-file members still in opposition. To understand all of this, we turn to Washington and Al Hunt of "Bloomberg View" and Robert Costa of "The Washington Post." Thank you both for coming. Bob, you have written about this in a piece for tomorrow. Tell me where it is, tell me what impact the president had, and are all the cards, in terms of threats and promises, in his hand? 

After months of the president focusing on executive orders and settling into the presidency, this is his first major legislative test. I just stepped over here from the Capitol and I was meeting all day with senators and congressmen. And they told me that the president has plunged into these discussions, having meetings today, Tuesday, at the White House, coming to the Capitol to make a final plea to skittish House Republicans to pass this bill, pass Speaker Ryan's bill on Thursday as planned. He wants a victory, more than any detail in this bill, he wants a win. 

But he also has to address some of the issues that are politics to him in terms of what it does for his core supporters. 

Exactly right. And a lot of people privately within the Trump White House are a little bit uneasy about how health care is now leading the president's agenda. They worry about how this affects his core base, those people in rural states, blue-collar areas of the country, some of them on Medicaid assistance. His House Republican plan phases out much of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and you see Republicans like Senator Boozman and Cotton of Arkansas, and others from states that have poorer populations really wondering if this is the right thing, in particular, from a president who ran on fiery populism and not touching entitlements in the same way that Speaker Ryan has long advocated. 

Al, what does this vote mean for the president? 

Well, a loss, a defeat would be a disaster. I think a victory would be really bad politically but a defeat would be much worse, Charlie. They have to do something because failure is just not an option. I think if it were held right now -- and Bob's been up at the Capitol, I've just been talking to people by phone -- my guess is it might not pass right now, but it will pass by Thursday night or whenever they hold the vote. But they've done it with a bunch of necessary gimmicks. The president I think has been a very effective lobbyist. You mentioned the Medicaid in New York State, that was a special gimmick for New York state. They said that, you know, Medicaid would have a work requirement. I assume that doesn't apply to nursing homes, Charlie, so you and I will be okay eventually. And there are other gimmicks in here, but my favorite gimmick was, on the tax credits, they instruct the Senate to do this. Now, I've covered the Senate for a long time. They usually don't take terribly well to instructions coming from the other body. So I think they will achieve what is absolutely a baseline essential for them, to get it through the House, it will move through the Senate. They may even ultimately, with Mitch McConnell's dealmaking talents, be able to get a deal through the Senate, and with Trump's lobbying. In the long run, I think this is going to be a loser because Bob Teeter, the great pollster, one of the three greatest I've ever known, the late Robert Teeter, Republican, told me 20 years ago, whichever party owns health care, it will be a political loser. The Democrats have found that out and I think the Republicans are about to find that out. 

Bob, do you agree with what Al just said in terms of it probably wouldn't pass today but by Thursday it will pass? 

As of Tuesday evening, based in my own whip count at the Capitol and talking to top House leadership aides, there are probably between 20 and 30 hard-nosed, which means the bill as of right now would likely fail if it was brought to the House floor. But Speaker Ryan, his aides tell me and his friends tell me that he wants to bring it to the floor. He believes the Republican Party since the Obama era has talked about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act and they have to move politically on this. This is why he wanted to move it first. They're making the case to members that if you don't vote on this now, you disrupt all plans for tax reform because much of this first bill is a reconciliation bill, meaning it deals with taxes and gutting some of the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act. 

Do you believe, as some have suggested, that he should have done tax reform first and then health care? 

Well, if you look at some of the president's allies, people like pundit Laura Ingraham and Chris Ruddy, his friend who he hangs out with at Mar-a-Lago, the more populist at the party say Trump should have started with infrastructure and taxes and job creation, and going along with Speaker Ryan moves him in an ideological direction that wasn't part of why he won last year. 

So the president's argument seems to be a threat in part now, you know, he threatened the head of the Freedom Caucus and I'm not sure what the reporting is about that, if it's a closed session. Go ahead, you can tell me. 

Real quick. When the president visited the Capitol Tuesday morning, he had an exchange with Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, and he said, we may go after you, and he said it in a joking way, but a lot of people in the room told me that they saw it as kind of a veiled threat. Trump likes to keep the House GOP on edge. He may not go after them. He may not be angling to have primary challenges. He wants them to know that he's an unpredictable president and he needs a win. And if he has a threat out there, even if it's in a chuckle, he wants it still to be out there. 

Al, is he the kind of president that can say to them, I need you on this, you have to help me on this, everything is at stake? 

Well, he's certainly done a better job than some feared he would d
