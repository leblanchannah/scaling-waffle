We begin this evening with Syria, the Assad regime resumed bombing rebel targets a day after the U.S. launched 59 missile strikes at a Syrian air base on Friday. It was the first time the U.S. directly intervened in the Syrian civil war. Meanwhile Secretary of State Rex Tillerson criticized Russia ahead of his first diplomatic trip to Moscow on Tuesday. He suggested the Kremlin may be complicit in Syria's chemical weapons assault that killed dozens of civilians last week. Questions are raised about President Trump's Syria policy going forward and U.S. willingness to escalate its role in fighting Assad's forces. Articulating contrasting visions in Sunday interviews, Secretary Tillerson said ISIS remains a priority but the U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley focused on President Assad. Joining me now from Washington, Derek Chollet. He served as an assistant defense secretary during the Obama administration. Here in New York is Robert Ford. He is a former ambassador to Syria. I'm pleased to have both of them on this program. Let me just begin with the obvious here. Tell me your assessment of this strike. 

I think this strike was a good idea. I saw a statement from Secretary of Defense Mattis that it destroyed about 20 percent of Assad's operational warplanes. So left Assad with some capability but he paid a price. The point is to re-establish deterrents against the Assad government using chemical weapons in Syria. It's a limited, defined, discreet objective and I think it needed to be done. And so now it's up to Secretary Tillerson to get the Russians to understand that we're serious and for the Russians to turn to their Syrian allies and say really, don't keep doing that. 

Do you think that will happen? 

I don't think the Russians are happy that Assad used chemical weapons. I doubt very much that the Russians have tried very hard to get Assad to stop doing it. 

Do you -- 

There's a difference. 

Absolutely. Do you believe they're complicit in that they knew he had access to chemical weapons? 

Oh, I think they knew that very well. 

So they were complicit in the way they see -- 

It's not a secret that they had them, Charlie. 

Right. 

The United Nations had an investigative team that last November, November 11, 2016, issued a report saying that on at least three confirmed instances, as well as others, the Syrian government had been dropping chlorine gas in this area of Syria, Idlib province, during 2014 and 2015 and they said there are other incidents beyond the three that it was likely they did it, but these are the three we are positive they did it. 

And what were the primary gases that the Syrian government gave up at the time of the Russian-negotiated -- 

They gave up materials related to the production of sarin and other binary nerve agents, but they kept all the time chlorine, it's not prescribed under the chemical weapons convention. And using it, chlorine gas, as a weapon, of course, though is against the Geneva Conventions and it was against the U.N. Security Council resolution that the Russians and the Americans worked out in 2013. 

Do you assume this is a change not only in tactics, but strategy by the Trump government? Well, the president says he was so moved that he had the right to change his mind about Syria. 

For sure it's a change in tactics. I was very surprised that they struck the way they did, I was very surprised. I think it's terrific if it is a change in strategy. We don't know -- if Assad tests the American administration again, as he is almost certainly going to do, are they going to, again, defend that red line and insist on making Assad pay a price till he is finally deterred? We don't know yet. 

And what about the Russians saying that they and the Iranians will meet force with force? 

That's where Tillerson will have to say you are really going to threaten us with force when we're trying to stop the use of chemical weapons, which you yourselves agreed in 2013 was beyond the pale. 

And which is an international norm that is beyond the pale. 

Well, exactly. The Russians suffered from chemical weapons attacks in World War I, just like our soldiers did in World War I. 

Derek, same question essentially, how do you put this in the context of the future? 

Well, first, I agree with Robert that this is a discreet use of force, it was justifiable, it seemed to be well planned and well executed. I think the question to my mind, and Charlie, your opening where you talked about the different comments coming from Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley sort of points this up, which is, is this a chess move or is it a checkers move? It seems to be the latter, a checkers move. It is something akin to what President Bill Clinton did to Saddam Hussein in June of 1993 when he conducted a Tomahawk strike in Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam's effort to try to assassinate George H.W. Bush. So I think right now it's a one-off. The question is whether the administration has the appetite to try to gain leverage out of this strike. It could seek to just stick to the narrow issue of the use of chemical weapons and the message to Assad is essentially you can continue to prosecute this war, if you use chemical weapons, we'll take a whack at you. If you don't, we're essentially going to conduct the policy that they had a week ago or this could be the game changer. I have my doubts on whether President Trump has done a complete reversal of the policy that was articulated a week ago about Assad, but we'll see. 

Saying, it's up -- I think it was Tillerson, the Secretary of State said, it was up to the Syrian people to choose their leader. 

That's true but then of course as you noted, Ambassador Haley said something more akin to regime change. And actually President Trump in his statement to the American people last Thursday night said sort of both things in his statement. And he hasn't really been pressed on this since then. So I think this is really still open for debate. 

Do you get the sense that this is driven by General Mattis and General H.R. McMasters? 

No, I don't. I think -- 

It's driven by? 

I think it's driven by a president who was touched by the images. We can speculate all day about why he actually ended up doing it. But I don't think that the United States military or the Secretary of Defense or National Security Advisor McMaster went to the president and said hey, here is a chance we can thwack part of Bashar al-Assad's air force. That strikes me as highly unlikely. Much more likely that the president turned to them and said, what options do we have in responding? 

And they suggested something that was executed reasonably well in terms of the speed and the precision. 

I think the plans were on the shelf from all the way back in 2013. 

Well, you would know something about that, wouldn't you, Derek? 

Yes. Robert's absolutely right. It seems to be -- the president said as much -- these pictures horrified him. They horrified all of us. He quickly turned to his team for options. The U.S. military planned for many options in Syria. I think one big difference today versus 2013 is the U.S. military has been engaged in the Syrian air space every day since September 2014. So we had a lot of capability in the theater, so to speak. It's not something we had to move a lot of ships around to get them ready to go so the president could execute pretty quickly. 

You and I talked this morning at "CBS This Morning." When you look at a strategy, you seem to emphasize, for the most part, get the Russians to lean on Assad and get some kind of transition government coming in. 

I want to distinguish here, Charlie. I do not think the Russians are ever going to deliver Assad in a political transition. They won't. I think it is perhaps possible to get the Russians to lean on Assad to stop using chemical weapons. The Russians have sunk a lot of resources and a lot of political effort into keeping Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. The idea that they are now going to turn around and jettison him as a favor to the Americans, I find that very hard to imagine. 

But is he at risk for them in anyway? Yes, they keep their base. Yes, they have saved him. Yes, therefore he is obligated to them. 

Well -- 

But also -- 

Their leverage is undermined by the heavy Iranian presence. And in fact, Iran is even more important for Assad than the Russians are. 

Because they have boots on the ground? 

Tens of thousands. 

Yes. 

Both Iranian soldiers, Revolutionary Guard, and then militiamen that they have mobilized from parts of Iraq, from Afghan refugee communities in Afghanistan, from Pakistan, from Lebanon. This is on the ground where Assad is little by little by little grinding out a victory. But in that kind of hard war of attrition, the boots on the ground are vital. And it's not Russia that is providing those, it's Iran. 

And Russia is providing the air power. 

The air power helps, absolutely, and in fact, that's why the Iranians begged the Russians in summer of 2015 to come in and help because for a moment, the rebels were on the verge of defeating Assad again, and so the Russians had to come in to restore the balance in Assad's favor. 

We go right to Derek in a minute but does Putin have a lot at stake here because Syria was one signal of his re-emergence -- 

Precisely. 

-- as a player. 

Precisely. That's what I am saying. They've invested a lot in Assad. I don't see -- whatever price they would ask to change Assad would be enormous and would probably be not less than removing all of the sanctions after Ukraine and Crimea and probably more than that. 

Everybody talks and Robert Ford talks about leverage on the ground helps negotiation. We had 51 diplomats from the State Department talk about that very fact during the Obama administration. Secretary Kerry supported them. The president listened, I assume, but didn't say very much about it. What is leverage on the ground and what is a reasonable leverage on the ground to produce a willingness for people to try to come to the negotiating table? 

Well, we got to deliver real pain on Assad. And I think there's also the Russian calculation as Robert just mentioned. I mean, there is no question Russia, which is more engaged in Syria today than it was four or five years ago in terms of just number of personnel on the ground, knew that Assad had the stockpile or there is every reason to believe that they knew he had it. The question is whether they were surprised by this use of chemical weapons and if in fact they're angry that he's done it because it has put them in a terrible position. If you think back to the 2013 red line episode which Robert and I were both in the government then and advocating for the use of force, it was U.S. pressure and the credible threat of force by the United States that of course then brought the Russians around to bring Assad to heel, to come forth with a diplomatic agreement to give up over a thousand tons of his chemical weapons. So I guess the question to my mind now is whether the Russians feel that pressure enough, and whether what happened on Thursday night is enough to change their minds that they want to do more to bring Assad to heel. I agree with Robert -- they don't want to throw Assad overboard right away. They don't want to do that. They want to control their position. They've invested a lot in this, both in material and obviously in their credibility, but the question is whether he has misbehaved enough that they are willing to put some pressure on him and I think that's what Tillerson's going to have to test this week in Moscow. 

You think he'll see the president, President Putin? The Russians are sending signals that this is a meeting between foreign ministers. 

Right, I mean, it's customary that the Secretary of State would see President Putin. Sometimes these things happen where they don't announce it and it becomes a kind of surprise meeting. But I think that will be an easy indicator, if he even gets in the room with President Putin, we'll know whether this is a serous visit or not. 

Was it a mistake for President Obama to believe that the Russians would do what they had promised to do in that agreement -- help me understand the agreement -- do what they promised and make sure that all those chemical weapons were gotten out of Syria? 

Look, I think President Obama ended up achieving something that none of us imagined was possible, which was the peaceful removal of 1,300 tons of chemical weapons, materials, and actual weaponized stuff from Syria. That's a huge accomplishment that made us all safer. In many ways, the fact that that material is not in Syria today and the concern is not how that would proliferate in response to any U.S. strike, freed President Trump up to take the shot that he did because we weren't -- we're not worried today about setting off a proliferation nightmare inside of Syria. But as Robert's noted, what's clear is that whether it's the use of homemade chemical weapons by using industrial chemicals like chlorine, or what seems to have happened in this case, which is the use of sarin gas which was covered under the 2013 agreement, it's not clear to me whether this is manufactured since that agreement or the stuff that was left behind. But the bottomline is it's on Russia to try to ensure that Assad is holding up his end of the bargain. He clearly has not. He did not last week, which is why the strike Thursday night was justified. 

Did you believe -- I mean, this is often debated in foreign policy circles --whether President Obama made a mistake after they crossed a red line by agreeing to this and not agreeing to what he said he would do. 

Well, I strongly supported that there be some kind of limited strikes, again, just for the purpose of deterring further use of chemical weapons. I think had we done it, the Geneva talks, the second round of which we were trying to prepare at the time, might have gone forward a little quicker and maybe would have had a better result. As it was, they collapsed immediately in early 2014, but that's old history, Charlie. I think as I look at this going -- 

To learn from. 

Yes. As I look at this going forward, I noticed two things about Russian behavior which I think would be an interest to viewers. Number one, we had a deal with them in 2013 that if Assad used chemical weapons again, the Security Council would agree to some kind of Chapter VII, United Nations Chapter VII measure, could be economic sanctions on Syria, could be military action on Syria, could be some other punishment that the Security Council would agree to if Syria was confirmed to use any chemical weapons again. The Russians and the Chinese agreed to that in October 2013. Fast-forward to the end of 2016, the report I mentioned, November 2016, confirms at least three uses of chlorine gas, the Russians veto. That puts a big question in my mind about Russian credibility on promises. Another one, again, I was talking about the Geneva talks that came after the Obama red line incident. The Russians agreed with us on the agenda. The agenda for that Geneva II round of negotiations and political transition was at the top. We get to the talks, a couple of months later, the Russians walk back and say, oh, no, no, we can't discuss political transition, there is nothing we can do. Again, I think the lesson that all of us should take out of this is treat Russian promises with great caution. 

Was it Section VII that allowed the United States to do and Europe to do what they did in Libya? 

Yes, exactly. And the Russians on that instance went ahead thinking that it was going to be military action only to prevent the assault on Benghazi. They were then upset that the United States and European countries used that same U.N. Security Council resolution to help Libyan rebels overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. They said that was not the intent of the resolution. 

And the Russians also haven't done very much about in the fight against ISIS and they promised to do that. 

No. Their huge emphasis since their strong intervention in September 2015, their huge emphasis has been on the rebels fighting Assad, not against the Islamic State. They've left that to us and our allies. I dare say, Charlie, I bet the French and the Belgians have hit the Islamic State by air more often in Syria than the Russians have. 

Derek, you were going to say? 

I completely agree with that. I think this idea that we are going to partner with Russia to fight ISIS is a fool's errand. We have not heard the Trump administration talk about that much recently. That was much discussed last year in the campaign. But I don't think Russia has any real interest in working with us against ISIS. They want to protect and keep Assad in power. 

So going forward, what's the strategy? 

Look, I think that the U.S. needs to find a way to create more leverage in these negotiations. I think we all agree it has to be a negotiated outcome because the other options are really not available to us unless we're contemplating, which I don't think anyone seriously is, a massive U.S. intervention. The challenge for us all along has been how do we develop that leverage particularly using military power without us getting on the slippery slope of "owning Syria." It could be that this moment has created a new context, that this administration can take advantage of. It's going to take an incredible amount of diplomatic skill to pull this off. I'm not sure we have seen that kind of skill yet out of this team. It's obviously the first test. It's one thing to lob 59 Tomahawks on a well-planned strike into Syria. It's another thing to turn that into leverage to try to get some sort of diplomatic outcome. So, you know, I think the next few weeks are going to be a real test, again, whether this was a checkers move or a chess move. 

OK, but everybody talks about leverage and I don't quite get what leverage we might have. Go ahead, Derek. 

I mean, the leverage is, can you raise the level of pain enough on Assad or the fear by Russia that Assad is going to go and their interests are going to be in jeopardy in Syria, that they either force Assad to come to a deal or Assad himself comes to a deal. It's very difficult to achieve leverage, it is easy to say we should create leverage, much harder to actually create it. 

How close was Assad to falling? 

In 2013, in the spring of 2013 he was -- his forces were falling back rapidly, lost control of all the border areas. He lost control of whole provinces. 

Is that when the Russians came in? 

No, that's when the Iranians came in. 

The Iranians came in then. 

And then again, rebel forces including those we were backing, again had Assad forces falling back in his -- the heartland, the bed rock of his political base around Latakia and the Mediterranean coast was coming under artillery fire. That's when the Iranians sent their Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force General, Soleimani, to Moscow to beg them to come in and help. And that's when Putin sent in Russian fighter bombers. 

Secretary of State Tillerson said yes today with George Stephanopoulos that he in fact thought the strategy ought to be to finish off ISIS and then get engaged by the civil war. 

I think that will be hard to do in a conclusive manner because as long as the civil war is raging in parts of Syria, extremists will benefit from recruitment. It may not be as big a recruitment as it was say in 2014, when they took Mosul but it will be big enough to maintain an insurgency. And in fact there are indications that the Islamic State is getting ready to move to insurgency mode. So, think of Ramadi, think of Fallujah circa 2005 and 2006. 

I've had people at this table who fought in Fallujah and they've never forgotten it. Yes, Derek? 

Charlie, and there's tension with what Robert just outlined between the short and medium term challenges because of course the U.S. military priority remains today the fight against ISIS. And I agree with Robert, ISIS, I think, will be delivered a military defeat soon. Raqqa will be taken, Mosul and Iraq will be retaken. The big question is what comes next if that's not primarily a military mission, it's more of a political governance mission, but that is intention within this near term problem of Assad testing us and putting us in the position of having to respond to him again militarily for the civil war and the use of chemical weapons. That's, I don't think, a fight the U.S. military wants to have right now, the Assad fight. I think they want to finish the fight with ISIS, that's what they see is the priority. But these are intentions because these will be playing out at the same time. 

Are we about to see a new cold war with Russia? 

I don't know that I'd go so far as a cold war, because Russia of today is not the Soviet Union of the 1970s and '80s. But there is no question that whether you are looking at what Russia is doing in Europe, whether what Russia is doing in the Middle East, what it's doing in Libya, what it is doing in the United States of America in terms of trying to undermine confidence in our own democracy and meddling in elections, that Russia is seeking to be a disrupter of the international system in every way that it can. 

I think if I could just -- Derek got it exactly right. I would just say, I think here in the United States for a long time, we sort of forgot about Russia after the wall came down and the Soviet Union collapsed. And then Russia was there and it had its own internal problems. And we sort of moved on to other things in the way Americans are always looking ahead. But I think Russia now views very much that it competes with us, and we fell out of the habit of thinking that we compete with them. And so we may not feel that we need to compete with them but they're looking to compete with us. And so one of the reasons that the Iranians and Russians agree on something like Syria is they both view it as a way to dent American credibility and reduce American influence in the Middle East. 

How are they competing with us other than in Syria? >
