Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky has hired two prominent criminal lawyers, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein. Joining me now for a consideration of what all this means, ALAN DERSHOWITZ, criminal attorney, appeal attorney, and professor at Harvard Law School. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

This doesn't surprise you. 

No, in fact, it probably should have come sooner rather than as late as now because not only must she disassociate herself from Ginsburg but from the statements that he made. After all, this man has made statements in effect admitting that she committed perjury, at least it could be construed that way. 

B acknowledging-- 

--that there may have-- that he may established a sexual relationship. He disclosed -- improperly -- lawyer-client confidentiality. He made a statement that her testimony would be different if she got one kind of immunity and if she got a different kind of immunity. She gave-- and he gave an interview to an interview to an Israel newspaper saying, ''Because Clinton supports Israel, Monica Lewinsky supports Clinton.'' He made a proffer which he didn't really understand. It was almost like a legal ethics exam -- spot the mistakes. Now, it's important for poor Ms. Lewinsky to disassociate himself-- herself from all of those statements and try to start from scratch with a new legal team. 

Is it possible that she realizes, she and other people who are advising her, that she's in a bad place? And that she better do something dramatic and do it now and make a significant change? 

Oh, yes. 

In order to be able to disassociate herself from whatever led her to be in this deep hole? 

She is in a bad place because her lawyer made her testimony worthless unless it was corroborated by offering it, in effect, for sale. Now, this new team has to come in and say, ''Wait a minute, let's try to start from square one.'' It's not gonna be easy to do. And the White House is obviously gonna be paying very close attention. They had mixed feelings, I think, probably about Ginsburg. On the one hand, his incompetence helped them because it made her testimony useless. On the other hand, you get very worried when somebody who has no experiences handling a case involving a very important witness. Now, there are pros in there. But these pros do not have the president's interests, necessarily in mind. If they're real pros, they're out to protect their client. 

So, what should they do? 

Well, what they should do is make the best possible deal for the client, consistent with her being able to tell the truth. Now, it may be that she comes into the lawyer and says, ''Look, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna be Susan McDougal. I'm not gonna get the-- my president trouble.'' She doesn't strike me that way. I think she wants to get out of this thing with a minimum amount of damage, and so these are lawyers who are very experienced -- one, a former independent counsel; the other, who's taken on independent counsels. 

Assume that is-- what-- so, what does she do? Assuming she does not want to take the Susan McDougal route, which says, ''Put me in jail, do whatever you can-- want to do. I stand by what I've said before.'' 

The smartest answer-- The smartest answer her lawyer gave today, when he was interviewed, when they asked him, ''What are you gonna do?'' He said, ''I don't know. I just came into the case.'' He has to find out whether she has a defensible criminal case, whether it is worth the risk of having her go to trial or calling the independent counsel's bluff, saying, ''indict my client.'' I've done that on occasion, and the bluff has worked. They haven't indicted the client. On the other hand, if there's a very strong case, you have to go in and try to make a deal. 

So, probably-- 

Probably they'll try to make deal because-- 

What would a ''deal'' be? 

A deal will be that, in exchange for her not being prosecuted for anything, she will provide as much testimony as she can truthfully provide. Now, the risk is that these are very pro professional lawyers, but they're also kind of, you know, they're cynics. They understand the system. They may try to persuade her to give the independent counsel what he wants. And the risk is she may be pressured into testifying about something that isn't true in order to save her own skin. 

You think that could happen? 

I could-- I've seen it happen. It could happen. 

She would say, ''Somebody tried to suborn perjury,'' even though she didn't see it, because she wants to have the independent counsel give her maximum immunity. 

As I understand it, the independent counsel has basically said, ''You're not getting immunity unless you can go beyond the sexual into the perjury and obstruction of justice.'' And, remember, these are vague concepts -- obstruction of justice. And she could easily remember more clearly under pressure than she would remember without pressure. I'm sure she wouldn't be saying to herself, ''Now, I am becoming a perjurer.'' She would simply remember it advantageously. That's the problem of pressure. 

You are not known as a trial attorney. You are known as an appeal attorney and have taken some high-profile cases, including-- prepared to take the Simpson case, I guess. 

Right. 

And you were part of that team. Have you had any contact, any communication, with her or with members of her family or with anybody involved in this? 

If I did, I couldn't possibly comment on that. You can comment on people who've called you, and-- 

Negotiate-- Or is it likely you will join her team? 

No. I wouldn't think. I would hope she wouldn't need an appellate lawyer on her team. I would hope that this could be resolved at a much earlier level, that either there won't be a prosecution or, if there is a prosecution, there'd be an acquittal. I suspect that a jury would very unwilling to prosecute-- to convict a young woman caught between the ambitions of an independent counsel and the incompetence of her own initial lawyers. 

Is this all the incompetence of her lawyer? Or is this also the diligent work of Ken Starr and his prosecutors as they have (crosstalk) 

That's a very good question. It's a very good question. You never can tell. It's-- of course, you know, this is an interactive situation and the incompetence of one side shows out more clearly when you have a very competent legal defense team on the other side. And the one thing you have to say about Starr. He's won every legal battle. He has made some very frightening statements. 

Eleven for 11. 

But yesterday he made a speech in which he threatened, in effect, obstruction of justice charges against any lawyer who ''impedes'' his investigation, suggesting that invoking proper legal privileges may impede an investigation. I mean, he is out of control. He is overzealous. He is trashing the Constitution. Unfortunately, he's doing a good job of getting the support of the courts for his vendetta. 

How do you explain that? 

Well, first of all, his-- 

He's doing the right thing legally? Or that, while he may be making statements that you find offensive to your concept of justice and your concept of the judicial process in America-- 

Yeah, yeah. 

--it is all within the law? And -- secondly -- he's doin' a heck of a job in terms of the appeals and in terms of laying out the facts as he sees them. 

That's right. And he's also giving a great civics lesson to America because the one place where the White House is wrong is what's happening to this president happens to defendants and suspects all over the country. Prosecutors have this enormous power, supported by the courts, and in the past 25 years the courts have not stood up for the rights of individuals, have not stood up for the Bill of Rights. Prosecutors all over the country are 11-to-nothing in these kinds of cases. So, Starr is just replicating what's happening to defendants all over the country. If you don't like what's happening to this president, you ought to be speaking out about what happens to poor defendants, indigent defendants, black defendants all over the country. 

You don't like what's happening to this president? 

I don't like what's happening to this president. 

Because? 

Because it seems to me, when you have an independent counsel who is targeting somebody and who is treating this president as if he were a Mafia chieftain, taking a possible, possible, arguable sex lie, or sex act, and treating it as if it were a Watergate, it's just not right. You have to show a sense of priorities and a sense of perspective. 

Last question. How do you think this is gonna end? 

It's gonna end without a bang, but with a whimper, I suspect. It's gonna end with a report, maybe with an indictment or two, but not against the president. It's gonna linger over this presidency. This is a great president, who could have gone down in history as one of the greatest. And yet this is gonna linger on 'til the very end of his term. 

And will, in the end, there be evidence and testimony that is persuasive that he has lied? 

No. I don't think there will be evidence that's persuasive, and I think that both men can come out of this thing as victors -- Starr and the president -- if Starr, after looking at all the evidence, admits that he went through it, he went through it very carefully, but he doesn't have a case. If he admits that-- 

Do you think that he's capable of doing that? 

I do. I think he is because he has a career in front of him, and I think he understands that his-- he is better off admitting that he tried and failed than trying to come up with some indictment-- 

You've already made the assumption that there's nothing there. 

I don't think-- A -- I don't think there's anything there. B -- if it's there, Starr is not gonna be able to get it and prove his case. You know, the law can't always prove what happened. It can only prove what happened on the basis of admissible evidence. 

Can I read anything into your intense interest in this case? That you'd somehow like to be involved? 

Oh, I'm teaching this case in my legal ethics class next year. It's a wonderful, marvelous vehicle for teaching students about what not to do, how not to handle cases, and how to avoid problems for your client. 

But, with due respect, that wasn't my question. 

It's a case-- 

With the intense interest, would you like-- does it reflect a genuine desire to be involved in this more than just teaching a course as to what it represents in the ethics of the law? 

No. I like to look at this-- 

You don't want to be there somehow involved in some way on somebody's defense or appeal. 

I hope it doesn't come to appeal. 

You are dancing away from that question. 

I don't want it to come to appeal. I didn't want the Simpson case to come to appeal. 

All right. Thank you, Alan. 

Thank you.
