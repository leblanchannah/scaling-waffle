Sergio Garcia is here. He is the 2017 Masters champion. Last night, he won the green jacket in dramatic fashion defeating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here is a look at the winning putt. 

And after so many years, once and for all for Sergio! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 

It was a hard week but it was one very, very enjoyable and I will never forget. I get to call myself Masters champion. That is amazing. (APPLAUSE) 

The title was Garcia's first in what many consider the four major tournaments of the year. The Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA. Yesterday also marked what would have been the 60th birthday of Seve Ballesteros, the first Spaniard to win at Augusta National. I'm pleased to have him here at this table for the first time. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

And congratulations. (LAUGHTER) 

Thanks very much. 

You said to me your voice was a little hoarse and I thought you stayed up too late, you said no, it was the screaming. 

Yes. 

What are you screaming? What is the emotion? What is the feeling? 

It was just pretty much just saying, I think it was pretty much all in Spanish. It was just saying yes in Spanish and come on! But it was definitely the hardest I screamed ever, for that, for that length of time. And that's why my voice -- 

Fans were behind you all week. 

They were amazing. I've always felt very loved everywhere I play, obviously. But at Augusta, they have always cheered me on. They have always been very, you know, very high-class, you know, very respectful, not only to myself but to everyone. But I felt like this year from, even from the practice runs on, everybody was really behind me. And it definitely helped me to kind of push on and get a little bit of that extra energy that you need to be able to achieve something like that. 

You led the first day, did you feel it then that something is happening to me that's very good? 

Well, I felt -- The first two days it was really tough. It was very windy. It was gusty. The course was playing -- 

-- first day actually, didn't it? 

Yes, the second day, the second day we tied for the lead. But I was able to play two really good rounds on difficult conditions. And that put me in a great spot for Saturday. Then I played a good Saturday. And then we obviously played a great Sunday match-up with Justin Rose. I think we both played really hard. We both played really well. And we kind of ran out with it a little bit, we were three shots ahead of the pack. But it was a great battle with a good friend. 

It was a duel down to the finish. 

Yes, definitely. It was very, very enjoyable. 

And you two guys are friends? 

Yes. We obviously -- we played amateur golf together. We have played in Europe together. We've played here in the U.S. and Ryder Cups together. We've been in three, I think three or four teams for Europe now. So it has been a great relationship between the two of us. We also share the same sponsors, TaylorMade and Adidas. So we've always been big fans of each other. 

In 1998 at the PGA, you almost won, Tiger won. 

Yes. 

But people looked at the two of you and said, oh, my God, these guys are going to really be dueling for a long, long time. You played a lot of good golf. And you won tournaments, but not a major. What was it? How would you explain it? 

It is difficult to explain. I think there is probably a couple ways to explain it. One of them, Tiger was really good. (LAUGHTER) That is the easy one. Because what he did throughout all those years was just amazing. The way he managed to be there every single time and -- 

Was he as good as any golfer you have ever seen? 

Yes, for sure. 

Better than any golfer? 

Yes. I didn't really get to see Jack in his prime or anything like that. When I came out, he was already on his way out. Or Arnie or some of those old guys. I did get to see a little bit towards the ends of his career. But, you know, he was also extremely good in his prime. But Tiger was really in such control when he was out there, that it was difficult to -- you had to do something extraordinary to beat him. He was never going to give anything away. And that made it tough. Obviously, I had some opportunities here and there that I didn't take advantage of. A couple others, I got beaten. And, you know, it was just a matter of keep trying and keep putting myself in that situation. 

What is the expression "I got bitten" mean? 

Like somebody else played better than me. 

Oh, yes. (LAUGHTER) 

Some I didn't play as well as I should have. And some that I felt like I played well enough. Somebody else played a little better, you know. 

Is your game today as good as it's been? 

Yes. I have been saying that since the beginning of the year. I felt like I have been playing really, really well. I played extremely well in Dubai when I won earlier this year. And I feel like my control over my ball flight and my swing is probably around 2008, which was my best year on tour, and so... 

Nine years ago. 

Yes. So it definitely feels very, very solid. And I think mentally, I'm hitting in a better way now too. I feel a lot calmer. I feel like I'm starting to accept things much better than I used to. 

Reading a little bit of what you said since the victory yesterday, you kept saying I was -- I was calm. And you had some bad things happened to you. 

Yes. 

And some really good things. 

Yes. 

But you said even at the worst, I was calm. 

Yes. 

It didn't make me crazy. 

Yes. And that's probably the difference. That's probably the difference between standing here with you with a green jacket today and maybe finishing second or third. If, because I played on the front nine, I played great yesterday. And I probably should have been, I would say probably at least four under par. And I was two under par. I missed a couple. I missed three or four really good opportunities. But I knew I was playing well. I wasn't panicking. I was just like just keep doing what you are doing. They will drop, don't worry. Obviously I bogied 10 and 11, and that could have been a moment to kind of get a little bit worried. But I was like, you know, you are still doing fine. You are still close to the lead. You are still playing well. I felt very comfortable. So, the par on 13 was massive. That par putt, not only because it kind of felt like a birdie, but because it got me back in a positive way. I made a good putt that I needed to make. That helped me play 14 great, I made birdie. 

Birdie on 14, then came 15. 

And played 15 amazing. That second shot I hit was probably the straightest eight iron I have ever hit. 

How much? How many yards, do you think? 

It was 189 yards, a little bit downhill, a tiny bit downwind. 

That's a bit further than my -- 

Yes, and a little bit of adrenaline. (LAUGHTER) 

This is the approach at 15 we just talked about, take a look at it. 

Really high, hard, accelerating follow-through, trying to get it up in the air. Oh, he almost holes it out in the fly-in! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I don't know that Sergio knows how close that came to going in. 

The great thing about that is that it left me a nice, little bit left-to-right, straight uphill putt. 

How many yards? 

It was probably about -- 

Ten? 

No, it was probably about, I would say 12 feet. 

Yes, I mean feet. 

Yes. If it would have not hit the flag, it probably would've been closer, it probably would've been maybe six or seven feet, but it would've been a downhill left-to-right with a lot of break. It would have been a tougher putt. So those little things that, you know, maybe you look at it and you say oh, I hit the flag. It went a little bit farther. Yeah, but you know, it kind of worked in my favor because it left me an easier putt to hole. 

And then you were back in it? 

Yes, yes, Justin birdied that hole, and got to nine under. We both got to nine under. We both hit great shots on 16. Unfortunately, he made a great birdie and unfortunately, I didn't hit a very good putt there. But same thing, you know, I didn't freak out. I was like, you know, you are still playing great. So you have two holes to go. You need to make one birdie, unless he makes a mistake. Or maybe two and see what happens. And he bogied 17, I made a good solid par. And then on 18, we hit two great shots and we both had chances of making birdies. I think we both hit great putts. None of them broke the way we thought they were going to break. We both missed it just on the right lip, yes. (CROWD GROANING) 

He hung it out. As I said, it's flat there. 

Now, were you outdriving Justin most of the day? 

Yes, most of the day. I think it was a combination of I was swinging really nicely and I was going after it with my driver. I hit some really nice drives. At the same time, Justin was hitting the ball well, but he was, you know, his back problems that he has had, he was still feeling it a little bit, and a couple of drives, he nicked them a little bit and didn't hit them as long as he can hit them because he can hit it as far as me pretty much. 

What is that about 320, 30? 

Yes. It depends on the situation but it is usually like a 300 carry. So and then it depends on the roll. 

There is another picture I want to show you. Here, this one. (LAUGHTER) Did she make a difference for you in terms of confidence? This is your fiancee. 

Yes, Angela. 

Angela. 

Yes, she definitely has helped. There is no doubt about that. I think her and my whole team, have been working hard to, you know, make me better golfer, better person. And we have all put in effort. And she definitely has put her little bit in it. 

You grew up in a relatively small town in Spain. 

Yes. 

Your father was a caddy. Your mother ran The Pro Shop. 

Yes. 

Were they both there? 

Yes, they were. 

At the Masters? 

Yes, they were. 

Tell me about the first thing your father said to you -- Victor. 

Victor, yes. He was -- he could barely say anything because they were both, I mean everybody was crying, you know. My dad, my mom, Angela. 

Yes. 

Her parents were there too. So, everybody was very, very emotional. But I think my dad, if I remember correctly, he gave me a big hug. And he said, you know, you have done it. So happy, so proud of you. You won the Masters. This is just unbelievable. 

You have said the triumph was a demonstration of my mentality and my character. What did you mean? 

Well, I said it throughout the week. I said it that sometimes there at the Masters and in some other tournaments, like my frame of mind hasn't been where it should have been, you know. I'd been, like we were talking before, not accepting things, letting things happen, trying to force things. So that week, last week, I was much better at that. I was much better at committing to what I wanted to do, calming myself down, and accepting what was happening, good and bad. So not getting ahead of myself when I was making a birdie or an eagle or whatever. 

Do you have a pro who is an instructor or is it more physical and in a team that travels with you having to do with -- 

Yes, I mean, when I talk about team, I mean Angela, I mean obviously my dad, that is also my coach. 

Oh, he is? 

Yes, my whole life, yes. He also played a little bit on the Seniors Tour. He is also a professional. My mom, my managers, my caddy, everyone that helps around, my whole family, Angela's family, everyone that, you know, brings something positive to the team and to me. So it helps me, it helps me to play better. 

I hope you win the grand slam. 

Thank you, that will be great. (LAUGHTER) 

Promise you will come back to this table. 

I will. 

All right, great. Thank you so much. 

Thank you very much. 

Congratulations on a mastery of the game. 

Thank you.
