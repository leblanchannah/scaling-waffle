Daniele Thompson is here. She is a French filmmaker whose new film is called Cezanne et Moi. It traces the friendship of post-impressionist painter Paul Cezanne, and writer Emile Zola. The two first met as young schoolboys in Aix-en-Provence and were friends for 40 years. Set in the 19th century, it delves into the Parisian art world and offers a glimpse into the minds of its most radical thinkers. Here is a look at the film's trailer. (MUSIC) (MUSIC) (MUSIC) (MUSIC) (MUSIC) (MUSIC) (MUSIC) I am pleased to have Daniele Thompson back at this table. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

Great to see you as well. They're allowing you to make a film that is not a comedy. 

Well, it is a first. (LAUGHTER) Well, I did -- you know, when I was a writer, when I was a screenwriter, I wrote a lot of films that were comedies. But this time, I thought, you know, I am going to try and really dig into this incredible relationship. 

What was it that intrigued you? 

The first thing that intrigued me is that I never heard of it. I mean, of course like everybody else who has ever stepped into a museum and seen paintings of Cezanne, and, you know, and of course in school in France we have to read Zola, I mean, this is really part of our culture. But I never knew that they actually had known each other. And suddenly reading an article in a magazine, I found out that not only did they know each other but they met as children in this tiny little town in the south of France at the time. And the idea that these two little boys had become sort of these monumental figures. 

And very different little boys in terms of their background. 

Exactly. But very, very strong and passionate friendship as children build, and then a very long friendship, it survived a lot of problems and this is basically the story of the film. But they eventually broke up and the breaking up was really the thing that I thought intrigued me the most. And so I started research. 

That was, what, in about 1886? 

They were born in 1839, Cezanne, and 1840, Zola. 

Right. 

So they were really the same age. So they were 20 in 1860. 

Yes. 

And this is when all of that group of young new artists -- 

All went to Paris. 

All went to Paris, or some of them were in Paris, but the thing to do was to go to Paris for something to happen because nothing was happening in the rest of the country. And this is where it was happening. And they were a fabulous group. You always see today these sort of bearded, old men and, you know, you were old at 45 at the time anyway, but they were young and starving and loving, you know, sleeping with the models and it was a little bit like what happened 100 years later, in fact, in the '60s. 

Right. 

What we call the '60s in the 20th century, you know, where there was this revolution of all of this group of young people rebelling against the establishment. 

Right. 

The bourgeois and suddenly throwing away all of the rules. 

But as you said they were different. I mean one came from the upper class, Cezanne. 

Yes, which I discovered, I didn't know that. I knew very little about Cezanne. 

What was your source material? Was it the letters of Cezanne? 

A lot of letters between the two of them. 

Yes. 

A lot of wonderful letters, which actually have been published for the first time together a few months ago by Gallimard in Paris. Beautifully written letters, very, very intimate, almost love letters. 

This was like a bromance. 

Yes, exactly. And also a lot of biographies of one and the other, but nothing really about them, between them. This was my job. 

So they broke up because Zola published a book called "The Masterpiece." 

Yes. 

You know, And Cezanne took great umbrage at that book because he thought it was about him because it was about a failed painter. 

Exactly. 

And he didn't find fame until after he was dead almost. 

Exactly. He had a little bit of, you know, a recognition in the last few years of his life, actually, after Zola died because Zola died four years before. Strange circumstances, you know, a lot of people, including his family, think that Zola was murdered because of the Dreyfus Affair. 

Right. 

That's another story, another film. (LAUGHTER) But -- 

Are you going to make that too? 

No, I don't think so. (LAUGHTER) But it is true that Cezanne in his lifetime, you know, was ignored and really, not only by the establishment, but by his friends, by his best friend. This is probably one of the things that was the most painful for him, because he admired a lot of Zola's writing and he loved his books and read them all. And when he received this book, he said, at the time, he is 48 years old, he starts reading the book and when you actually, you know, have gone into research about their lives and you read the book you think, oh, my God, I understand why he was so upset because it is so intimately what they had been through as children -- 

Had stolen from their lives. 

Very much so and the portrait of the hero of the book, which in fact he is not a hero at all, he is really a very, very, very difficult person, very much like Cezanne in real life, and someone who is so desperate to find what he is looking for in painting and never does and ends up hanging himself in front of a painting, so -- 

Hanging himself in front of a painting. 

This is the end of the book, and so Cezanne reads this, and he recognizes so many things about himself. He did not kill himself in front of -- 

His weaknesses and everything else. 

Yes, exactly. And very personal things that they had been through together. I mean, but this is a problem that a lot of writers have, I mean, writers are vampires, we all know that. 

Suck the blood out of everything they can find. 

Absolutely. But the thing is, of course, when I read about this breakup, I thought, well, there must be also something else, you just don't break up for one reason, it is like in love affairs, there are a lot of other things that, you know, obviously have happened in between them. That's how I decided to look into it and see these two people were opposite all the time. And yet they loved each other and they kept wanting to survive, to make this friendship survive, because it is their youth, and -- 

What is really great about the films in terms of -- I love the opening of the film, in which you come out and you show Zola writing and then you show Cezanne painting. And then you go back to that point in which they were young and they were just meeting each other. 

Yes, little boys. 

As little boys, yes, and you see the whole thing there, you know, within a minute and a half. 

It is based on a lot of information about, you know, true facts that, you know. 

But some liberty with facts, some artistic license. 

A lot. 

Yes. (LAUGHTER) 

A lot. 

In terms of doing what? 

Well, in terms, for instance, of inventing the frame of the story, which is that last, let's say the last rendezvous, the last weekend which is really the frame of the film, probably never happened, because everybody thinks that after the publication of the book -- 

There never was a meeting? 

There was never a meeting, maybe there was, in fact, there was a letter from Cezanne to Zola that was discovered after I wrote the film. 

Right. 

So that was a very exciting thing to find out. He said I am going to come and see you, so maybe what invented actually happened, but we will never know. But what I really tried to do was, if they had seen each other, if they had met and if they had had this strange last weekend, what would they have said to each other that they had never actually had the courage to, you know, confront. And that is how I started writing, and then decided to do this flashback construction of the film, where you see a lot of the wonderful things that they have had in common and the terrible things that actually separated them. 

What's interesting, too, is that in your casting, you send the script to an actor thinking he'll play one part, and he writes back and says, oh, I want to play the other. 

Yes. Guillaume Gallienne, who's a wonderful actor, who's at the Comedy France, and who's himself actually a film director, and he's a very, very talented actor. He played a small part years ago when he was not famous yet, in the film that I made 10 years ago called "Avenue Montaigne." 

Oh, yes. 

And so -- 

A film that got a lot of attention, by the way. 

Yes. You know, we remain friends and I right away after I finished the screenplay, I sent it to him and I said, you know, read this and read the part of Zola. And he called me and said, I love the script, but I want to play Cezanne. And I was, you know, obviously shaken by that news, thinking, well, it is not at all what I had managed. But that is sometimes very good to actually be confronted to something that you have not imagined and see, you know, and so he said, well, let's read together and I'll see if I can convince you. And he did. 

Yes. What is interesting back to the first question I asked you, is this notion of how long you wanted to do this, you know, and people thinking of you as primarily doing comedies. 

It is true that most of the time, you know, when I discovered this relationship, not that story, because there was no story, I actually built the story, but this relationship I thought maybe there is a story in this. And then I would do a comedy and then, thank God it would be successful, and then of course I would do another and things went, you know. And then every time I would finish a film, I would think, well, maybe I should take the time because it is not like you suddenly write something, you know, that is happening today. You have really to spend a lot of time speculating that you might find something out of this -- out of this -- all the details you find in biographies and get very, very, very intimate also with the time, with the way people lived and the way they -- what they had to eat and how they -- you know, you have to feel completely comfortable in that other century to be able to start writing as if it was a movie that was in the streets of New York today. So I, about three years ago, I thought, well, this is the moment where maybe it is time for me to do something else, I'm getting old. (LAUGHTER) So, if I want to do this, it is now, and I will take the time, not, you know, I didn't know whether I was going to find enough dramatic energy in this to build a screenplay, but then after a few months, I decided I was ready to try and give my own point of view. 

But you had a lot of stuff to build on, I mean, you had a lot of sources about the relationship of their individual lives. Books have been written about each of them. 

Yes, there were a lot of things about each of them and of course you know more about Zola anyway and I knew more about Zola of course because first of all, you know much more about a writer from his writing than a painter is a mysterious figure behind the canvas. So I knew very little about Cezanne, even the fact that Cezanne was so ignored during his life. 

Yes. 

Because you always think of Van Gogh, you know, which everybody of course always uses as an example of the "peintre maudit," you know, the cursed artist. But Cezanne was like that, too, and Cezanne also is now on the list of the bipolar people which of course, you know, was an unknown phenomenon even though it existed at the time. He was always up and down and he was very, very -- he had a rage in him, in himself. And also he looked for something all his life, something new that he was looking for, like -- and had such a hard time finding it and then when you see the paintings of the last ten years, he found it, and, you know, he was this revolutionary artist that influenced -- 

Cubism. 

Cubism and Abstractionism. 

Yes. 

But it is fascinating that in fact his best friend in the meantime, who actually was a journalist when he was young and a very brilliant one. 

And wrote about artists. 

And was a very, very interesting art critic. 

Right. 

And defended the impressionists who were the bunch of young people who were, in fact, the word impressionist was actually used to make fun of them. 

When does the movie premiere? 

March 31st in New York and then it goes all over, and I hope people can -- 

Well, it is a great, great story, and you have got these two fascinating characters at the centerpiece, you know, and there is a touch of authenticity to it because they were real and they had lives and they did know each other, you know, and there are women involved. 

And how. 

And how. 

And how, yes. 

You couldn't have a film from France without women being involved, could you? 

Absolutely not. And they are great actors. I love my actors. 

At what point did Cezanne marry? 

When did he marry? 

Yes. 

When his son was seven years old, you know, and he never dared tell his father that he was married because he was not really proud of his wife who was not a bourgeois. And so he lived, you know, the extraordinary thing is that when they were little boys, Cezanne was the one who invited little boy Zola over to give him food because he was literally starving. And then as soon as they became young men and they were in Paris and Cezanne had so little money to live on, it was Zola who started making money who helped him for many, many years. 

Yes. Because Zola had found fame, you know, early. 

Very early. 

In his life. 

Very early. 

Exactly the opposite from Cezanne. 

It is the opposite. It is completely opposite all the time. And it's very -- 

And it is as if Yin and Yang. 

You know, the places I shot the film were at the real places, the house you see is Zola's house, and -- 

That would've been a reason to make the film enough. 

Exactly, and when I went looking for locations, you know, where everybody was always very, very -- I mean, it was very touching to sort of be there where they were and in Aix-en-Provence, all around that cabana, which is the cabana where Cezanne rented for practically all his life. It was very hard to get permission to shoot there because it is a place that -- it is a national park, and they are terrified of fire. 

Yes. 

But we managed. We had permission to be exactly in those places and that was something that, you know, brought something very magic for me to the film. 

Do you know what you are going to do next? 

I probably will do a long -- a project for television. 

You mean because of the opportunities in television today to do -- 

I've always worked for television, even when I was very young, and it was actually not a very good thing to do in France because most great writers despise television. But I didn't because I had lived in this country. 

No longer here. 

No longer there anymore either, so things are changing and I think I might do that. I am still now in my Cezanne and Zola story but I am going to be able to start really thinking of something new soon. 

Great to see you. 

Thank you. 

Daniele Thompson. Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
