And then we'll be back. Stay with us. 

Before I introduce my next guest, I should tell you that that came from "Great Performances: Dance in America." "Tap Dance in America with Gregory Hines" will be seeing this Friday, October 11th, right here on Channel 13. His name is Tommy Tune, but it might as well as Tony Tune, he has won nine of them in four different areas of theater. One colleague said "Working with him was like being dropkicked into dreamland." Meet the man who's brought the magic back to Broadway from "My One and Only" to "Grand Hotel" to "The Will Rogers Follies." We're pleased to have Tommy Tune join us now. Welcome. 

Hi. How are you? 

Nice to have you. You just joined us from doing something, from winning a big award. 

Do you think I'm overdressed? I'm sorry. 

Let me hold this up. forth, and you said this is foreign policy and this is the This is called the "Mr. Abbott" for Lifetime Achievement in the Theater, awarded to Tommy Tune, October 7th, 1991, Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation. 

Yeah, I was just given that. 

You were just given it tonight? 

Yeah, I just got it. I just -- I said thank you very much and ran over here. 

Mr. Abbott is still alive. guy who does it and now I'm interested. 

Mr. Abbott is 104 years old. And he's the mentor of the musical theater in this country. I mean, he's great. 

When did you know this is what you wanted to do, I mean, like, dance and be a performer? 

Well, dance first. I think I was just born to dance, so I think I always danced. At five I had my first lesson. And dancing, the rest of it's been kind of just a spinoff from that. 

Is there any teacher responsible for that or is this something that your mom or -- 

She came tonight, you know. That was a surprise, at this awards ceremony my drama teacher from high school, who -- up until high school I danced. And when I got to high school, they said, "What do you want to major in?" And I said dancing. And they said, "Well, we don't offer that, but maybe you should go meet the drama teacher." And so I went. 

And then maybe we can think about basketball. 

Yeah, well of course basketball and track, they were always asking -- I didn't like basketball though. 

You didn't, even at, what, sixth, seventh? 

Well, Van Sauter was a microcosm of the sweeping 

Well, I didn't like the costumes, you see. 

What do you mean, the costumes? 

Well, you know, the little short things. 

I was a tall man wearing short pants walking on hardwood. 

Yes, slapping each other's bottoms. Anyway. 

At some point you said, "If I'm really going to do this, I got to go to New York." 

Yeah, well I came up -- my graduation present from high school at 17 was a trip to New York. Everybody else was asking for cars. I asked for a trip to New York. My parents obliged. I came up here. I saw every show that was on Broadway that summer. Scared me to death and I ran right back home and said, "I got to learn some more." So then I went to college and studied and studied and studied. 

And did you finish or did you -- changes that are still going on in broadcast journalism, how 

Yeah. Sure. I did everything. I started work on my masters, and then when they told me when I started to write my thesis that I couldn't say, "I felt that I wanted to do the set in black and white because," they said, "You can't say it that way, you have to say 'The director felt," and I went, I can't write this thesis. I'm leaving. And that's when I came up and started auditioning for Broadway shows. 

And how soon was it before you got a break? 

The day I arrived. 

The day you arrived? 

Yeah. 

What happened? 

Isn't that amazing? 

It is amazing. 

It was Saint Patrick's Day. when he entered it in 1982 and to now it's vastly different. I don't remember the year. But I was out of college. And I went to an audition. I arrived. A friend of mine said, "Here's what you got to do, you got to go buy a paper, it's called 'Backstage,' it will tell you what the auditions are and where they are." I looked. There was an audition. I went, I got the job. 

And has there been any real drought since then? 

Oh, sure. I've had lots of valleys. One valley left me going over to Italy and making a film in Italy, in Italian. But that was a huge life experience, too. 

You're on tour now. 

I'm on tour with "Bye Bye Birdie." We're in Boston right now. And we play another week in Boston. 

You have said, and you may have written this as We go to Pittsburgh. I'm going to be out all across America through next May. Are you doing that -- obviously it's remunerative for you to do that, but are you doing it also well, and so has Jim, that there was a lot of talk back about a because it gives you a chance to perform? I mean, Will Rogers has opened here and "Grand Hotel" is playing here, and all of that brings you satisfaction. 

Yeah, I'm a dancer. A dancer dances. I do all the other things, and I love doing them, but my root is a dancer. And while I'm still able to do it I owe it -- you're given a gift, you have to give it back. couple of years ago that because of Peter Jennings ascendency at You must. It's part of it. It's part of the exchange. 

It's a gift. 

Sure it is, because I don't know what dancing is. I mean, if you asked me to define it, I couldn't. I couldn't possibly explain to you how I do it. But I know when I'm doing it. "World News" and because of Koppel doing as well as he was When you click into when you're performing and you're doing it, and it works, it's something higher. You know, there's that line in the Bible that says, "Ye who danceth knoweth not what we are knowing." And I don't know what I know about it, but I know it's -- I'm sure it's akin to, like, coming down on a mountain on skis and making the right play. It's something like that, but it's beyond that, because it's art. 

And what's the magic for you? What's the best moment for you when you're dancing? I mean, is it just the experience of finding -- 

Well, you know, the French use the word "répétition," repetition, and that's what they use, they don't have a word for rehearsal. They call it repetition. And you do a dance and you do it and you do it and you do it, and it takes many, many performances before you master it. But at some time you click into the next thing and you're no longer -- you don't have to do the dance, you just dance, and that's what you're always looking for. 

Yeah. I mean, in sports, which I'm more familiar with, they talk about you can't think about doing it, you just have to do it. 

Yeah. 

You feel it and you know how to do it. 

I'm sure it's the same thing. 

You can't sit there with a golf swing or hitting a bat and think about what you're going to do because in the muscles and -- 

Yeah, you can't. But, because it is a fixed thing, you do -- you go through a process when you are thinking it, but you're not dancing when you're thinking it. That's the repetition, that's the rehearsal. But you keep doing it enough to where you can leave go the technique because the technique is there to free you, and then something happens. 

You seem to be unique and one of a kind. Was there anybody though -- I mean, I think of all the people that I know about who played the role that you have in theater, Bob Fosse or Michael Bennett and Gower Champion, and who else, I mean, there's a -- might put in that list? Did any of them act as a role model for you? Were any of them in a sense -- 

All of them. And all of the people -- you know, I'm the seventh winner of this award, and the first winner was Hal Prince, and then there was Bob Fosse, and then there was Mike Nichols, and then Agnes de Mille, and then Michael Bennett, and then Gene Saks, and now tonight it was passed onto me. And every one of those people are terribly important. 

Yeah. But they were choreographers more than dancers, maybe with exception to Fosse at one point or something, maybe, right? 

Yeah, well Michael Bennett was a great dancer. 

Was he? 

He was a great dancer, but not a performer. Something else. Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, you know, were heavy influences on the performing thing. But are we talking -- I never know what I'm talking about when I'm talking to you. Am I talking about being a director or choreographer or a dancer. 

No, I'm talking about being a dancer, the performance and who you draw inspiration from. 

Well, Fred Astaire first. 

Why? 

Because he was the best. He was the best. And he didn't do steps, you see. He didn't do steps. And in his autobiography he said, "People are always asking him," he says, "I don't know, I just dance. I just dance." That's the quote, "I just dance." And that gave me a clue, you know, that it isn't a rational thing. 

Knowing how much you -- understanding the gift, knowing how much you love dancing, you created "Will Rogers," you created "Grand Hotel," but neither of them were for you. Why not create -- 

Well I don't do that for me. 

Why not though? You understand yourself and you know how to create. I mean, you -- 

Because you got to have your director, you got to have a -- you can't do it for yourself. If I could do it for myself I'd put me out of business. 

Tommy Tune needs a Tommy Tune, doesn't he? 

Or someone, like Gene Saks directed "Bye Bye Birdie" and he did a great job. It's the best performance that I've ever had pulled out of me. You know, and he's totally different. He works totally different from the way I work with directors. 

How does he pull a performance out of you? 

He tells you the story. He said, "Now, look, here's a guy that's the manager of the biggest rock star that's ever happened and this rock star is being drafted, and you're losing your meal ticket," you know. 

Now dance. 

Yeah, now dance. You know, he's great. He's a great director. 

And you can do the same thing. 

In a different way. 

With Keith Carradine. 

In a different way. 

And how do you do it? 

I don't know. 

You don't know? 

No, I -- 

These are things you can't - it's because it's art and performance, you can't define it? 

Well, you know, if you're any good you work a different way with each person. You know, I've worked with great directors. They showed a clip of a movie I did years ago called "The Boy Friend," that Ken Russell directed who's a terrific filmmaker. And I was determined to learn how he directed because I admired his work. And when I got cast in the movie I went, "I'm going to find out how he does it." And I would just sit on the other side of the camera watching him direct, and he was a different person for every actor. 

Because he understood the psychology that was necessary for each of them to motivate them. 

Yeah. And there was a scene that Twiggy wasn't getting, and he just took her by the hand and left the soundstage. We waited for five minutes, they came back, shot the scene. And so I said, "Twigs, what did he tell you?" She said, "Well, we just walked outside and he said, 'Oh, look at the sun, aren't the trees pretty this time of year,' and we came back in and it was right." So he knew how to manage her into a performance. You know, it's -- I don't know. 

Are you worried about the theater in New York today? I mean, "Will Rogers" opened, and I saw you that evening after that event. 

Oh, yeah. 

And Frank Rich had written a column that did not -- I mean had written a review that did not thrill you 

Oh, yeah, didn't like it. 

Didn't like it. 

No. But then a wonderful thing happened -- 

What does that do -- go ahead. 

It hurts your feelings. 

It does more than that. 

It hurts business. But then on Sunday, this man who writes for the Times named David Richards wrote a glowing review. And more people saw it than Frank's review because it was in the Sunday paper and everybody sees the "Sunday Times." And it was major. And he really loved it and he really got it. He understood what I was going for. He was able to put into words what I could only put into the show, because I can't put it into words. If I put it into words I'd be a writer. And he told me back what I had done. And I went, "Oh, my gosh, he got it." You know, and you're always hoping that the people that write about you will get what you're doing. 

And he did that just by watching the performance. It's not because he sat and had long conversations with you about -- 

Oh, I've never met the man. 

You've never met David Richards? 

Oh, years ago I did an interview with him when I came to Washington. 

Have you ever met Frank Rich? 

No. 

Never met him? 

No. 

Never had a conversation with him? 

No. 

Would you like to? 

Yeah, sure. I'm told he's very charming. 

I talked to him on the phone because I wanted him to come on this broadcast, and he was, I mean, very bright and obviously very charming, and he's done some media. 

Oh, yeah. 

But you'd like to meet him. Why wouldn't you call up the phone and say, "Frank, this is Tommy Tune and I'd just like to talk about theater"? He might say, "It's not good for me to do that." 

I'm told that he doesn't want to touch with anybody that works in the theater because it might influence him, you know, in his writing or things like that. 

You could understand that. 

Sure. 

But it would be nice to talk inside a critic's head. 

It would be helpful. It would be helpful, I think, if we could do that. But, well, maybe it'll happen someday. I would like to because he's - you know, he's knowledgeable and he knows specifically what he likes. 

Yeah. 

And, you know, we get to like what we get to like. I wish he liked my stuff better. 

Did he like "Grant Hotel"? I don't remember that. Did he like it? 

He's always very -- in a way "Grand Hotel," he was very respectful of what I do. 

Yeah. 

But I don't -- and even -- 

"Will Rogers" he was very respectful of what you do. He said -- 

(Inaudible). 

He was. I mean, I reread that. He said that you were trying to do two things there, and that was a problem, as I remember. Do you remember that review? 

No. 

No. 

You know why? 

Why? 

Because I didn't read it. 

You never read it? Because somebody said to you, "Tommy -- 

I'll read it, but it will be a while. 

Yeah, it still hurts? 

Well, sure. But later it doesn't. 

What damage did it do? Let's assume, because you got David Richards, who came from the "Washington Post" and is a terrific theater person, what damage -- 

He writes very well, David Richards. He really does. 

And he understands you. 

Yeah, well that's always helpful. 

What damage did Frank Rich's review, if any? 

Well, it's like this, every good thing that's written about your work helps. Every bad thing hurts. 

Yeah. 

And it's as simple as that. And that's not just as a director or choreographer, as a performer. 

Why is it that the "New York Times" is so powerful? 

Well it's our only paper. Remember when we used to have lots of papers? You're too young to remember it. 

And so people really do depend on the judgment of one reviewer as to -- 

Well what else are you going to read? See, it used to be -- 

Well, Bill Henry writes for "Time Magazine." 

Yeah, but that's not -- that's later. The ones that come out the night after the show opens, you know, you're looking, and so there's the "Times." There used to be all these papers and all these really knowledgeable men and women that wrote about the theater, and they were fabulous. 

Yeah, people like Walter Kerr and Brooks Atkinson. 

And Brooks Atkinson and on and on and on. And, you know, in the annals you can read these reviews and they were written with an energy. Part of the problem, I think, is they used to have to see the show, run to their desks, write the review, and get it in and get it out. 

And now they see it at a review preview. 

Now they see it earlier and they think and mull. And, you know, I think it's like live television. This is more exciting than to now that if I say something I don't want to say, I could say, "Charlie, would you take that part out?" 

Exactly, it's better. 

It's better. It's using the medium. 

Yeah, you bet. There ought to be more of that. 

And I think that -- see, we work under a deadline getting the show ready for opening night. And I think it's more exciting writing journalistically, to read it. Like the reviewer in Boston, there's a very tough critic in Boston, and he had to run back to the desk and write his review of "Bye Bye Birdie" and get it in the paper, and it had muscle. It was also positive. 

You like that. Do you notice a difference as you go from -- somebody told me they saw you in Dallas and they loved it. A friend of mine saw you in Dallas. Now you're in Boston. You probably have been to Los Angeles, a lot of other places. Is there -- I mean, do you have five good reviews and three bad reviews? I mean, is there a real difference in the reaction to it? 

Let me tell you something. I'm going to be sorry that I tell you. This show, "Bye Bye Birdie," has gotten rave reviews in every city from every writer, every one. 

That tells you something, doesn't it? 

Well it's great. It tells me a lot about what's going on in America today. It tells me about a lot of -- 

What does it tell you? 

The craft of the show is very -- you know, it's a 30-year-old show. 

I know, but doesn't that tell you something? I mean, the criticism is that everybody wants to see that the economics of the business has gotten so that you can't be experimental, that you can't do anything because the only thing people want to take a risk on is something that they know has a reasonable chance of success because it's got a proven record in the past, right? 

Yeah. 

Yeah. They do say that. What do you think of Michael Jackson as a dancer? 

Oh, he's fabulous. Michael Jackson is a great dancer. He's great. 

If he could come to Broadway it would knock them dead, hmm? If you could create a show, would you create a show around Michael Jackson? I mean, he probably wouldn't come because he makes -- 

Well, I don't know about his acting. I don't know what that is. You see, to be in a Broadway show, the kind of Broadway show that I understand, the musical comedy, you have to do everything. You have to be able to sing, you have to be able to dance, and you have to be able to act. And beyond that you have to be able to seam it all together so you don't shift gears to go from one to the next. You have to do it a whole thing. 

This is live and I'm out of time. 

Oh, great. It goes by so fast when we're talking. 

What's next for you? "Bye Bye Birdie" through May. 

"Bye Bye Birdie" through May, yeah. Oh, I don't know. I'm working on a bunch of shows. I don't like to talk about what's coming up because it's like if you have a bag, a paper bag, and it's filled with sand, and you start -- you pull a little hole in the bottom of it and sand starts going out. You start talking about what you're going to do, by the way you're ready to do it you have an empty bag. 

Does this mean as much to you or more to you than all those Tonys? 

This is very major for me. 

Lifetime achievement. 

I feel like I'm getting started. 

Tommy Tune. When we come back we'll talk about Columbus. And in the meantime, you'll see an excerpt from a public television special series, I think seven hours in three or four days, about Christopher Columbus, the discovery. And when we come back we'll talk about the man and the myth and
