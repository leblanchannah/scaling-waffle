This is one of those moments. You know what I'm talking about. Everyone has an opinion. I've heard people this week say they've set rules, are we going to talk about Trump or not? Jon Stewart retired last year, but he's back on the "Colbert" show virtually every night which is blowing away Jimmy Fallon's "Tonight Show" ratings. Who do we really need back to guide us in this, what do you call it, time. We lost writer Christopher Hitchens in 2011 to cancer, but when he was alive, no president, no monarch, politician, not even God was safe from his perfect cutting commentary, his historical wisdomizing. Hitchens was unpredictable with a rapier wit, a voice equal parts gravel and whiskey. He was a '60s socialist and an ardent supporter of the invasion of Iraq. No one wore the badge of contrarian more proudly than Christopher Hitchens. As he once explained to Charlie Rose. 

Not everyone wants to always be an awkward cuss, or out of step, or against the stream, but if you do feel the consensus doesn't speak for you, if there is something about you that makes you feel it would be worth being unpopular or marginal, for the chance to lead your own life and have a life instead of a career or job, then I can promise you it is worthwhile, yes. 

So what would Hitch say? That's right. What would Hitch say about America in this age of Donald Trump? With me are some of Hitch's many friends and colleagues. From Stanford, California, is his widow, Carol Blue Hitchens; historian Douglas Brinkley is in Austin, Texas; and here in the studio are the novelist Martin Amis; and journalist and author, Leslie Cockburn. Welcome to all of you. 

Thank you. 

Carol, let me begin with you. You memorably told me that right up until his last moments he was engaged in the news. So we can absolutely predict that he would have had something to say about what's going on right now. 

Yes, I think he probably would have something to say every time he wrote a column or every time he came on TV and, sadly, we have to try to infer what he might have said and really only he could say it. But there you go. 

Intellectual forensics, that's what we'll call it. So Douglas Brinkley, he always had a sort of historical reference that nobody else had that could create a kind of parallel. What do you think he would find as the most important or significant historical reference that would describe this time of Donald Trump? 

Well, he probably would have turned backed to George Orwell who he loved so much. And the very fact of the matter is, Orwell's books are back in circulation. One consistency of this contrarian Christopher Hitchens, our friend, was his disdain of authoritarianism in any guise. He would go after whether it's Henry Kissinger or the Catholic Church, he did not care if he smelled authoritarianism. And so I think the moves of Donald Trump to suppress journalists would drive Hitchens mad. But he would also see this as a grand opportunity, living in Washington, D.C., to lampoon Trump's, you know, speakers that are coming in, people who are on television. He would have just loved to have warred with people like Steve Bannon or Kellyanne Conway, because he knew he would be able to devastate them. Nobody could beat Hitchens in a debate. And he would have picked up, I think, the cause of the freedom of the press, anti-authoritarianism would have questioned all of Trump's seeming fascist tendencies. 

Although, because Trump is an opportunity to lambaste traditional liberalism in Washington, D.C., and because of the sort of contempt for the Clintons that Christopher Hitchens had, in the election, it's hard for me to know where he would have come down on this election. Leslie, what do you think? 

I think Christopher would have been appalled by Trump. But he also would have said, who gave us Trump? Hillary Clinton. I mean, Christopher was not, as you know, a big supporter of Hillary Clinton. 

No. 

And I feel that he would have said it's because of the way they ran that campaign that we ended up with Donald Trump. I think he would have laid a lot of responsibility at her feet. 

Liberalism infuriated Christopher it seemed to me. Just the sort of the complacent liberalism of sort of the intellectual elite drove him crazy. What do you think he would say about the people who support Donald Trump versus the people who have contempt for him? 

I think he would be very active in the resistance. I think he would sense that this was, you know, a moment that has chosen him. I think he would have more or less ignored Trump himself, and he wouldn't -- he thought Bill Clinton was a titanic vulgarian. He would have jumped out of his shoes to see Trump in his pomp. I think he would have gone for Steve Bannon. He would have honed in on Steve Bannon, who revealed himself yesterday as a semiliterate neurotic when he said, every morning President Trump tells Reince and I -- he means Reince and me -- I mean, that's a gross illiteracy. The idea of him being an intellectual is laughable. He's another neurotic windbag. 

Exactly. And I think Christopher would have said look to the language. First with Trump, the incredible poverty and paucity of his language. And, you know, his attack on the press. We remember the nattering nabobs of negativity. Well, that's what's coming out of Bannon and Trump's mouths now. So, just look to the language is what he would have said. And I think he would have learned a lot from that. And I agree with you, Martin, the idea that Bannon is the intellectual heavyweight and ideologue of this kind of supra-nationalist wing of the Republican Party is laughable. 

What would he think of Bannon as, Doug Brinkley, a kind of Robespierre, a Svengali? 

Well, he would have seen what Martin just pointed out. I mean, how many -- it's like Swiss cheese just filled with holes. I mean, Hitchens was deeply well read and a brilliant interpreter of modern life, and Bannon is sort of like Goldman Sachs hack, wannabe producer in Hollywood, who kind of stumbled upon after 9/11 this philosophy of raw American nationalism, kind of thoughtless. And, you know, Hitchens often word against established religions in general, and so, the fact of Bannon trying to play some kind of god, Donald Trump, you know, the first lady reading the Lord's Prayer at the Florida rally the other day, those are things that would have irritated Hitchens. But I do think he would have aimed for Bannon as the intellectual poser. And also, Leslie nailed it, too. There's no way Christopher Hitchens would have voted for Hillary Clinton. 

What do you think his verdict on the state of the American system would be right now? 

Well, I think a couple of things. One -- remember Christopher said the totalitarian is my enemy, not the person who tells you how to live or makes you pay taxes. It's the person who wants to control how you think. So he would be very concerned of what's happening in those Spicer press conferences. And it's coming out of Bannon and Miller and Trump himself, this sort of controlling the thought process. It goes back way before Orwell to Tom Payne who made it very clear that if you can't think, then liberty, you know, is a shadow that quits the horizon. So I think that looking at the numbers, he would have, for example on the whole Russia issue, I think he would have loved the Putin bashing, loved it, but I think he would not have bought the notion that the Russians threw the election in any way. I think he would have said that was the responsibility of the Hillary campaign. He would have looked at the numbers in Michigan, for example, he would have said, they weren't there on the ground, they didn't woo the unions, they didn't do that job. 

I think he would zero in on these threats to the press. You know, everyone knows democracy can't work without a free press. And these dark menacing remarks that Bannon and Trump have been making about the opposition party, and they said we're going to do something about it. Now, that's what would set off all the alarm bells. 

He would love being called the enemy. I mean, you see it on cable news, this sort of sanctimonious kind of like, why are you calling me the enemy, you know, kind of thing. I'm just a journalist. He would take it. He would just, oh, I'm the enemy, then? You would see that spirit come out, and that's what's really absent right now. 

He would say I am the enemy. 

I think he would think it was a badge of honor for the press to be attacked in the way that it is. The question would be could the press, in general those who cover Trump, live up to it? It's a high compliment that they're attacking the press. The question is will the press deserve it. 

And that I think is the sort of salient question for us. I mean, the press itself has a job to do. When we say, what would Hitch say, it's because we miss him. It's because we admire him. But it's also because we're asking this question of, what is the press to do in this moment? What do you think, Doug? 

Well, we had Richard Nixon, after all. And Hitchens participated in all that. He loved to gossip about the Nixon tapes and all the heinous things that Nixon said. But I think one of Christopher's most successful endeavors was calling Henry Kissinger a war criminal. That took some bravery and he stayed on it with a steady drum beat whether you agree with it or not. And he was proud of the press. You know, Hunter S, Thompson wrote a book called, The Great Shark Hunt. The shark was Richard Nixon, and the press came and went after Nixon and got him. And I think Hitchens would be proud of investigative journalists. People like Leslie, who get out there and do stories, break news, and being in Washington, D.C., and not New York, he would have been the grand poobah of the modern press corps to date. Carol and Christopher used to throw grand parties with journalists coming over to their place. It would have been a hub of how Hitchens would have looked at this Trump phenomenon going on there. Their apartment would have been. It was the salon of Washington a decade ago and it would have still been now. 

He would say look what they're doing, which is not what the press is saying right now. The press is kind of reporting. But he, I think, had that spirit and that ability to rise above and say look what they're doing. 

He would have enjoined solidarity of the press. When one journalist is shouted down by Trump, all the other journalists, I am Spartacus. They should all ask the same question. They've got to be confrontational with him because he's going to be confrontational with the press. That moment when he said, we caught them in a real beauty today, the press, and they're going to pay for it. That beauty was that the crowds weren't as big as they were for Obama at his inauguration. It wasn't a beauty. Anything -- if someone gets his son's middle name wrong, he calls it fake news. He muddies the waters. Fake news is no longer usable through ambiguity now because Trump -- for Trump, it means news I don't like. 

So, Carol, does Christopher Hitchens, do you think, know the script of how we proceed? In other words, would he look back at his knowledge of Orwell and the 20th century, and the fascists and dictators who came and went and he could quote chapter and verse like no one else, and know where we're headed like no one else? 

Well, I mean, I think you're right about that. I think he also -- because I think we know Trump doesn't really read. There're two movies that I think he would be revisiting. And I'm certainly not the first to this point out. "The Manchurian Candidate," so imagine that Angela Lansbury is Bannon, though Bannon is not half as clever as she was. And then also, "Network," which I looked at it again recently, incredibly apt, and I think he would have been drawing on some of these movie references. In "Network," the problem was just the international corporatization of the media. Now we have it with the government, with the executive branch. You know, and I think, also, he would be really attacking the so-called Republican hold-outs, you know, the guys like McCain and, before that, you know, Rubio, who disgraced himself. You know, who questioned Tillerson, who had no business becoming secretary of state, and has, you know, international commercial relations with Russia. But then rubber-stamped it. So I think he would be turning an eye to the Congress and really going after members of the Senate and the Congress as well. 

Tillerson would be a particular target, I think, of Christopher. Douglas, wrap this up for us. 

I was going to say also somebody like Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, who just doesn't understand climate change, or the fact that Christopher went down and got to be waterboarded, and it is torture Hitchens said. And now, the Trump administration shrugging their shoulders, it's not really torture, those kinds of things would have inflamed him. 

Douglas Brinkley, Carol Blue, Leslie Cockburn, and Martin Amis. What would Hitch say? I think we have an inkling and thank you so much for that. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Good evening. I'm A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" filling in for Charlie Rose. The 89th Academy Awards will be held this Sunday in Los Angeles. Jimmy Kimmel will host the ceremony for first time. Damien Chazelle's musical, "La La Land," leads the pack with a record-tying 14 nominations. Barry Jenkins' coming of age drama, "Moonlight," and Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi film, "Arrival," follow with eight nominations apiece. And joining me now is David Edelstein, chief film critic for "New York Magazine," and vulture.com, and commentator for CBS Sunday morning. Aisha Harris, culture writer for "Slate" and host of the podcast "Represent;" and Josh Horowitz, MTV News correspondent and host of the podcast, "Happy, Sad, Confused." Very pleased to have them all at this table. And let's get right to it. So is it going to be a long night of "La La Land" sweeping through all the categories? And if so, why? 

I think if you're a betting man, yes, it's 14 nominations. It's the one to go with. And as to why, I mean, it's a crowd pleaser. It's escapist entertainment as far as 2016 is concerned. As far as nine best picture nominees are concerned, it's the closest thing, I think, to a movie that lets you forget your troubles at least until a bittersweet ending. And enjoy a classical form done right. 

And yet, it seems to be a movie that in its wake is quite polarizing. One of the things that surprised me since it first kind of emerged through the festival circuit in the fall is how people seem to be fighting about this movie. It's weirdly divisive. One of the objections to this movie has come from kind of jazz fan corners who say it gets jazz wrong, and that there is kind of an unpleasant racial politics running underneath it. Also, among the other objections, are that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can't sing or dance. 

That's fair. 

That's a huge part of why I didn't like the movie, is that when I go to a movie musical, I want to see you be either really good at dancing or really good at singing, but if you aren't good at both, then why I am going to see this movie musical? 

They're so good at being Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. 

When they're not singing and dancing. When they're not singing and dancing. 

Actually, what would you want? I mean, I love Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady." I love a lot of people. I don't want to hear Marnie Nixon's voice anymore. The thing about Ryan Gosling, OK, I can carry a tune better than Ryan Gosling, but Ryan Gosling sounds inevitably Ryan Gosling-esque when he sings "City of Stars." And that is just an extension of his personality and it's very likable. I mean, he's not the great singer that Fred Astaire was or the great dancer, but -- and Emma Stone, I think, has a very sweet voice. It doesn't have a lot of fullness, but it's on key and it's her somehow, it gets -- And that's, I think, what the movie is about. It's not everybody sort of stops dead and does this, wow, Gene Kelly number. It's actually -- the singing and dancing are kind of extensions of their personality, as they are in "Umbrellas of Cherbourg," which was a huge inspiration for Damien Chazelle. 

I think one of the criticisms that I think has come up and that I agree with is the fact that the music -- and I think maybe it's the music's fault. The music is not as memorable or very good, I think. Astaire did not have that great a voice but he was singing Berlin, he was singing Gershwin, whereas the music here, to me, does not stick out, but nothing stuck with me with the exception of that piano trill. But the lyrics and the music itself, I just didn't find that great. 

I don't know, I think they're ear worms. All five or six of them are stuck in my brain. And I think if anything, it's the irony we're talking about of "La La Land" is that it maybe plays least to musical aficionados because it's not full-throated singing, it's not 20 numbers. There's only six or seven songs in the film. It's a very non-traditional musical. And I think in some way that's why it's kind of transcended beyond just the musical theater crowd, and that's why it's resonated with a larger audience. 

I think there's something to that. I think it's also -- I mean, for me, it's really the last 30 minutes or so that kind of sold it to me, and made me kind of forgive some of its other lapses or flaws. And I think that has to do with movies, with a kind of an idea of what movies can do in a way that a film can tell a story of something that didn't happen with as much emotion or more, and conviction, than it tells the story of what did happen. And just that kind of idea and that openness to fantasy is, I think, something that maybe has been missing from a lot of Hollywood, and maybe why the Academy in particular is so willing -- so eager to anoint it and to anoint Damian Chazelle. 

That's why -- that's why I liked when you said you checked yourself when you said it was an escapist film, and then you said, well, until the bittersweet ending. Actually, it's a fairly tough-minded movie about people who put ambition before, you know, I mean, these are star -- these people are meant to be together in the stars, and to demonstrate that, they go to a planetarium. And, you know, I mean, if -- there is no other more clear way to say these people are fated to be together. And yet, you know, Damien Chazelle is a very driven guy and he understands -- I mean, he gave his ex-wife now a producing credit on the movie, but they broke apart. I think he understands -- as the last film he made pointed out, that artists are often, you know, leaving, you know, the niceties of real life behind in order to perfect their craft. I think that's very much in the movie. 

That was "Whiplash," the story of the jazz -- 

Let me say one more thing, his first film, "Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench," is a story of an interracial romance, and a wonderful black musician. And there are long-searching jazz solos in that movie that I think would surprise a lot of people from "La La Land," also very abrasive at times, and as well as a good old-fashioned song and dance number. So I think he's probably been blindsided by this sort of charge that he's kind of whitewashing jazz. 

And I think just the broader issue we should remember about anything -- this is how we do pop culture now, right, we love something only to tear it down. And "La La Land" has been in the driver seat for so long, since its debut at the Venice Film Festival, that it was kind of inevitable that it would be picked apart in these ways and it's just kind of the cyclical nature. I mean, "Moonlight" maybe hasn't had those chinks in the armor, but I think if you're out front as long as "La La Land" is, you're subject to criticism. 

You also have to point out that the world has changed, or at least America has changed. The election happened. And I think some of that pushback is also coming because we don't want the Academy to sort of give in to this escapist nature. We want it to more effectively confront that through another movie winning as opposed to "La La Land." 

This year, it is an unusually, and for another adverb, I think refreshingly, diverse group of nominees. I mean, one of the questions that comes up is, is this a sign that the Academy or that Hollywood is changing, is making some progress, is this kind of one of those moments of illusory progress that we have so often? I mean, what do you make of that dimension of the politics? 

Do you agree that there probably is going to be probably three out of the four major acting categories are going to have winners who are people of color? I hate that as much as everybody else, but non-whites let's say. 

This will be the first time in the history of the Academy. 

Yes. 

I'm not sure about Denzel if that's what you are referring to. 

Mahershala Ali seems to be a pretty good lock and Viola Davis. 

Yes. Denzel, I'm not so sure. I feel like Casey Affleck might sweep in and take that. 

This is part of this whole Oscar politics thing, and this is racial, too. And I don't mean racial because Denzel Washington is African-American and Casey Affleck is white. I mean that, you know, one of the ways they prick the consciences of these liberal, you know, white liberal Academy members, in many cases, is the sort of whisper campaign about the sexual harassment charges against Casey Affleck that were admittedly settled out of court, versus how Nate Parker's, "The Birth of a Nation," was pretty much -- that whole debate played out in the "Hollywood Reporter" versus "Variety" instead of "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post" because its aim was to affect Oscar voters, either to sell the movie to Oscar voters or turn Oscar voters against it. So, you know, I mean, I think there may be people -- that might be enough in a season like this. And, again, it has nothing to do with such quaint notions as artistic merit, which we would all like to believe in. It has to do with politics. 

Although, I think we can all agree, maybe "Birth of a Nation," also didn't have the stuff to necessarily be a worthy nominee. 

It stunk, it stunk. 

To put it delicately, I would agree. 

It turned out to be overpraised at Sundance. 

Yes, I think in terms of whether this is a watershed moment, is this the beginning of a new normal? It's honestly just too soon to say. Well, you know, this is, yes, this is progress. Is this the solution? No. I mean, it happens that there is some great films this year led by African-American actors, people of color, and that's great. But, I don't know, in some ways, I'm almost looking beyond the Academy. I'm looking at the blockbusters that are coming. That's almost more indicative to me of where the industry is headed. And allowing a Marvel film to come called "Black Panther," and to have a "Wonder Woman" film, have female-led franchises coming. That almost is more telling, I think, about where our culture is headed, and hopefully how the movie industry is reflecting society a little bit more. 

But then we have something like Ghost in a Shell" or "The Great Wall. 

True. 

So it seems like it's moving a little bit, but then in other regards, particularly within the Asian American community, it doesn't seem like we have advanced nearly as much. 

Let's get a little nutty here, too, and give credit where it's due. I think A.O. Scott at "The New York Times" has really pushed movies like "Moonlight" help to -- as much as we all loved it, I think you have been rather single-minded in getting us to see film -- getting the mainstream audience to see films by filmmakers of color. Let's not pretend that doesn't make a difference. It makes a difference with Oscar voters, makes a difference with the New York audiences, and, you know, that's sort of the elephant in the room. 

I am that elephant. (LAUGHTER) But I do want to talk about "Moonlight" because I do really have a very high regard for that movie, and great admiration for its director, Barry Jenkins. But I think also that, in that case, credit also should go to A24, the company that managed to take what is, in many ways, a challenging movie, not only because it's the story of a gay, black young man growing up in poverty, but also the way that it tells that story, the way that it uses the vocabulary of international art cinema to tell that story. The way that it doesn't follow a standard plot arc, and ends with this beautiful, delicate, quiet, intimate, I mean, it's the climactic moment in this movie is two guys drinking tea together, which is a pretty radical thing to get you an Oscar nomination. 

I think it's also radical in a sense that it is a movie about a gay character that still has hope underneath all the tragedy. I remember the first time I watched it, I kept wondering, what's going to happen like, is he going to survive? How terrible will this turn out to be for him, how tragic? And, in the end, it's not all easily solved, not everything is tied up in a nice bow, but there is some closure, and there is a ray of hope. And I think that for that to be a movie that is nominated as a movie about black people and about a gay character is really radical in its own way. 

It's a sad movie, but it's enormously hopeful and do any of the other movies have happy endings? 

On the spectrum of movies this year, it's the happiest movie we might have. 

"Hidden Figures" ends pretty well. (CROSSTALK) 

Let's talk about "Hidden Figures." "Hidden Figures" is the highest grossing of all the best picture nominees, having squeaked ahead of even "La La Land," and is, I think, a movie that has just kind of connected with audiences in a really wonderful way. It's a very conventional kind of movie. There is nothing radical about the form and the way it tells its stories and the way it sort of hits its beats and, yet, it also feels like its opening up new dimensions in stories that we might think we know or that we might have seen told in other ways in Hollywood movies. 

We're talking about trends and watershed moments, that is, to have, you know, three African-American women fronting your movie that is not a genre film, that's not like, you know, a mass market comedy, that's just like a well-told, very down-the-middle, based on a true story, crowd pleaser, that is something that should be acknowledged as a good moment. Is it the best movie of the year? No, but it works on its own level and it works as well as it should work and the casting is impeccable, it's great to see -- we talked about "Moonlight" -- Janelle Monae killing it in two different movies this year. Octavia Spencer, the Academy loves her. 

Even before Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes, there's been this question and a lot of, I think, fake controversy about politics and Oscar speeches and do politics have any place in movie awards shows, and we have Jimmy Kimmel, a new host, a popular late-night host, who has to kind of walk this tight rope between not seeming like an utter coward, and also not, you know, alienating middle America. I mean, how do you foresee the night unfolding as a political event? 

I think with Kimmel as host, I'm a little concerned, just because I don't think that he is our most astute comedian, so handling this very delicate time period I think will be difficult. Obviously there will be writers writing for him, but I kind of wish, even though Chris Rock had his ups and downs last year, I wish it was Chris Rock hosting again this year instead of him. I wonder if we'll see a repeat of the 2003 Oscars which occurred a few days after we invaded Iraq, although I guess the difference there is that I think people are more divided in Hollywood then about what we did -- 

It was only Michael Moore who stood up. 

Yeah, it was really just one -- I think there were a couple people who chose not to go. 

Billy Crystal was very careful. He walked on egg shells the whole time. But what about that documentary category? There are -- four of the five are very topical, very politically charged. "Fire At Sea," about the migrant crisis, the refugee crisis on a small island in Italy. Ava DuVernay's "13th," about mass incarceration. "O.J." Made in America," Ezra Edelman's epic kind of history of race and sports and masculinity and sexual violence and the court system and everything through the lens of that trial. And Raoul Peck's "I Am Not Your Negro," which brings James Baldwin back to life in a way, right in this moment, where he turns out to be the voice that many of us want to hear the most of. 

It helps when you put his words underneath actual contemporary footage, too. I think that would walk away with it if it hadn't been for O.J.: Made in America. "O.J." Made in America" is such an epic, such a monumental work, the only thing that might give anyone in Hollywood pause is that it really is a made-for-television event? It has been screened theatrically, but simply the running time gives Ezra Edelman so many more resources, so many ways of building his story that somebody limited to 90 minutes or two hours, doesn't have. I would vote for "O.J." in a heartbeat, though I love all the nominees. 

It's that category I think of the Oscars this year. I feel like those five have a place in the best picture category. I would put those up against any of the nine nominees. I would agree with you, "O.J." is the staggering achievement. I, myself, do agree with you, I mean, it feels a little bit false to put it in the film category, but whatever we call it, it is arguably the monumental pop culture work of 2016. You ran through the laundry list of the issues it deals with and that's thanks to an amazingly long running time, but also like an exceptional filmmaker like Ezra Edelman. 

And a great companion piece to Jeffery Toobin, who is filling in for Charlie, his book was the basis of the other monumental O.J. work, which looked at it much from a courtroom personality drama. 

You made a good point, though, Ezra had seven and a half hours to tell this story, and I'm just now thinking about it, and I had the pleasure of interviewing Raoul Peck for my podcast, and he told me he worked on this for ten years, like he worked a decade on a movie that is 90 minutes long, and this feat that he pulled off of putting all of these different passages from Baldwin together, then having Samuel Jackson not sound like Samuel Jackson also reading the words. 

He didn't really sound like Baldwin either. 

No, he didn't but I think that was fine. 

But there is a kind of density there, I mean, you do, after 90 minutes, you feel like you read six books. It's an incredible feeling. 

Let's just say, it's a great movie, it's out now, everybody should see it. 

Amen. Can we do a lightning round of, any surprises? I mean, we're sort of looking at it as if "La La Land" is a done deal in most of the categories. Is there some category where you think, you know, there might be an upset or a shock? 

Well, Hollywood loves Tony Erdman. I love Tony Erdman. It's a delightful, going to be remade by Americans, comedy about an overbearing dad and his trying to get his daughter to laugh again and have a sense of humor and a social conscience. 

Something you and I can maybe both relate to. 

However, what's happened with "Salesman," you know, might tip the balance. I think "Salesman" is a great movie, too. It's sort of an embarrassment of riches this year. That is why the Oscars are so heartbreaking. You don't want to see people kicked off the island. You want them all to sort of gather together and hug. I do, anyway. 

Such a bleeding heart liberal. 

Unless "A Man Called Ove" takes it. 

Sleeper pick right there. 

I would go with all the frontrunners, honestly. That being said, I never get my Oscar pool right despite being invited to this table. Supporting actors, I mean, last year, Mark Rylance did no publicity for "Bridge of Spies." Sly Stallone was supposed to get up there and accept that award. Mahershala Ali is clearly the favorite, but Dev Patel has all the muscle of the Weinsteins and "Lion." You never know. The greatest living actor on the planet is Michael Shannon in that category. For my money, I love that man and he can do no wrong. So I think that's a place to maybe look for an unlikely upset. 

I think that Emma Stone is probably going to win, but I can maybe see Natalie Portman sneaking in there, even though "Jackie" has kind of faded and that movie really is just about her and the movie itself is not that great. 

I'm feeling Isabelle Huppert in there. 

That could happen, too. 

Seriously? 

I think maybe. 

Can I just say, let me just say it again, I can think of so few of the nominees this year who I would not want to win, and in the past, you know, I get a bee in my bonnet about somebody, but this year it just makes me want to cry when I think about those actresses, and Annette Bening who gave my favorite performance of the year who was, you know, so, you know, cruelly ridiculously for 20th century women. As well as Amy Adams in "Arrival" which was a spectacular performance and she was also very good in that lousy "Nocturnal Animals" movie, too, which Shannon is so great in. But I think this is what's horrible about the Oscars. These people are all, this year, wonderful. I don't want anybody to -- (LAUGHTER AND CROSSTALK) -- they won't be. They're going to go home and go into the fetal position and cry for a few days. 

They'll cry into their millions of dollars. 

We have been grateful to have seen so much good work. You're ending this on a wonderful and unexpected note of optimism, as you said about "Moonlight." There is hope. We will go on. And the Oscars will be broadcast on ABC on Sunday night. It has been such a great pleasure talking with all of you. Aisha Harris, Josh Horowitz, David Edelstein, thank you so much. 

Good evening, I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin of "The New York Times" and CNBC filling in for Charlie Rose. One cannot overstate the power of technology to change the world. Jared Cohen is at the forefront of using technology to address some of our toughest challenges. He founded Google Ideas in 2010. He is now president of Jigsaw, its successor. The company is focused on a range of global security projects such as protecting people from online bullying and countering violent extremism. Before joining Google, Jared served at the State Department under Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, where he pioneered the concept of digital diplomacy. I am pleased to have Jared Cohen on this program. 

Thanks for having me. 

Thank you for coming. Especially because you have just announced a new project, which I want to get to immediately, which is called Perspective, an idea about protecting people from bullying, from harassment online, which is something that we talk and think about so often, what are you doing? 

Well, we're all familiar with the toxicity problem online. It is one of the few challenges in the world that we all have had some kind of, at least unfortunately, had some kind of experience with. Perspective uses machine learning to detect that toxicity online, so that we can help publishers do something to mitigate it. 

So Elon Musk, on Twitter, at one point called it a hellscape. What has happened to culture online? 

I think this is humanity with us having more visibility into it. So the notion of toxicity, and people being mean to each other is not new. Throughout history and in every corner of the globe, even today, we're all experiencing instances where somebody derails a conversation. But online barriers of entry are lower, people can sort of scurry out of there faster. But I think the main issue is we have to understand that the toxicity we experience online, it has real-world implications. 

And we're not talking about fake news in this instance, which we can get to in a moment. We're talking about the idea of what we see on social media. What we see in the comment section of news stories, what we see on Twitter and elsewhere. That is what this is about. 

The internet is made up of publishers and platforms and publishers and platforms are eager to moderate comments. They all have their sort of terms of service, which are too long for people to read, but they're overwhelmed by the volume of nasty comments and they're looking for a way to deal with it. What we've built with Perspective is an opportunity for any publisher in the world to run all their comments through Perspective and in return, they get a toxicity score of 0 to 100. In this case, we've defined toxicity by "this language is likely to cause somebody to leave the conversation." 

Just to put it in context, what's going to happen? If I wrote something that was toxic, does it get eliminated from everyone else's feed? Is that what is happening here? 

That is the beauty of Perspective. What we're trying to do is help with the detection of what's toxic, not trying to make a determination of what one does with that score. So we all know you work at "The New York Times" as well, Andrew, so if you're "The New York Times" and you're using Perspective, you may make a determination that any toxicity score north of 75, you're going to remove from the comments. 

How do you define toxicity? 

So again, in this case, the way we define toxicity is "these comments are likely to cause somebody to leave the conversation." Now, the way in which we've done this is we have data sets from partners, research partners. We've also taken data and crowd sourced it to accredited, annotationed organizations and asked them the question, which of these comments do you think are likely to cause somebody to leave? And what's fascinating about this is there was greater agreement among annotators on what constitutes a toxic comment than there was on what constitutes a personal attack, something that is obscene, something that's off topic, something that's hate or harassment. 

How do you define hate or harassment? This is the issue. It's one thing to force a conversation offline or someone to leave the conversation. But are we talking about language, is this about abusive language or something more? 

In this case, we're talking about abusive language, right? So, you know, in order to use machine learning models for something like this, you need a data set that is large enough to train against. 

This is artificial intelligence that's literally reading thousands, if not millions of sentences. 

Yes, so we have, for instance, a large data set for "The New York Times" that has annotated -- that's basically annotated according to what's toxic. So the machine is able to learn based on that training data set. And then we have other research partners and so forth. So we're also then able to go out to communities of people and crowd source an answer to the question which of these comments are toxic? So human beings are literally reading these comments and determining, this one is toxic. 

How do you imagine the partners and publishers, that you will ultimately partner with, will use this, which is to say, there's a big first amendment issue? 

The publishers have already drawn a line or at least articulated a line in terms of what constitutes a violation of their policies. Again, the beauty of this is we're putting the power in the hands of the publishers. So in terms of ways that people might use this, so an obvious use case is for moderation, right? So there's not nearly enough human moderators to sift through the comments, whereas, if the human moderators are able to see in batch, these comments are all sort of over our toxicity threshold based on the number returned by Perspective, they can do it more efficiently. You can also imagine a situation where a publisher might decide, we want the people writing the comments to know that the comment in which they wrote crosses that toxicity threshold as well. 

So is the ultimate goal to change behavior? 

The ultimate goal is to get people to come back to these conversations, to have more civil discussion and, yeah, it is to change behavior. The reason we want to change behavior is, you know, if you look at what is happening, people are either shutting down -- publishers are either shutting down comments altogether, or they're so overwhelmed with negative discourse that all the sane people aren't participating. 

What about fake news, which is to say, what happens when somebody comments and lies? 

Fake news, the challenge is, it keeps getting defined in different ways. We have to be careful, first, to distinguish between news we don't like and fake news. 

But this system is not Donna be looking at that. 

This is not about dealing with fake news. This is solving one problem which is, people are nasty to each other in online discussions, and the arbiters of what discourse should be allowed or not allowed, which are the publishers, currently do not have detection tools to be able to scale the process of moderation. 

Last question on this particular issue, which is, when you look at why there is so much hate online, what do you think that is about? I always say, if real life was as terrible as it sometimes feels online, man, would this be a bad world to live in. 

Yeah, I'm not a sociologist, but I have some hypotheses about this. I think there is something about the distance between the person making the comment and the victim of the comment that lowers barriers of entry. It's why somebody is quicker to give somebody a digital black eye than they are to go up to somebody and punch them in the face. 

But is this about -- it's not even about anonymity because people put their names next to some pretty horrible stuff. 

I think having technology is something that creates space between the attacker and the attacked. Again, I think it makes people not count to ten, it makes people not think about consequences, and the consequences are less apparent, so I think that is part of it. I think also we're interacting with more people online in any given day than we're going to physically interact with in our entire life. So as the touch points go up, people agitate us. We're also experiencing more people who are not a part of the circle of individuals we interact with. By virtue of being online, you're in the same town square as people all across the world and you're going to encounter more and more voices that you don't want to hear. 

I imagine if there's a critique of this, it is going to be this is the ultimate form of big brother. Have you thought about that? 

So we thought a lot about this in the process of building Perspective and in the process of doing these models. And one of the first things we wanted to do is ensure we built something that was a tool that, you know, would empower publishers to be the ones ensuring discourse was constructive. We made sure that we built something where neither our data nor our models are things that can be used by governments. At the end of the day, the best protection for users is the fact that machine learning models themselves can't see through encryption, which helps address any concerns that one might have about surveillance. But ultimately, my view is if you look at the trends of conversations online, they literally get more toxic by the day. So you have 4.3 billion people online today. By 2020, you're gonna have 6.1 billion people online on smartphones. That's a lot of new people being added to conversations, by the way, in parts of the world where there is a lot of sort of political, ethnic, sectarian tensions, so we should expect this to get much worse if we don't do something about it. So the question is, you know, for a problem that we all agree is bad, right, which is people having way too easy a time being nasty at scale, if we can use machine learning to address that problem, why would we not give it a try? 

While we're here, I want you to put your state department hat on, which is to say, you spend a lot of time thinking about digital diplomacy, you also think about cyber attacks, our cyber capabilities and the capabilities of others. What do you worry about right now? 

I think the biggest thing that I worry about is the world is in a perpetual state of cyber warfare that is being driven by a group of countries of sort of varying forms of governance, that are sort of the cyber powers, and they are deploying cyber capabilities on a day-to-day basis against each other, against their populations, you know, out into the wild, and the rules of engagement, for what it means for states to interact with each other in the cyber domain, have not yet been written. 

Are there countries we should worry about that have been underappreciated in terms of what their cyber capabilities are, or cyber capabilities that they're trying to get? 

I think we have a pretty -- I mean, to me, the most powerful cyber countries that -- you have the U.S., U.K., Germany, Israel, China, Russia, North Korea has a very sophisticated capability, Iran has very sophisticated capability. But I think the real question is not which states are we failing to identify, I think it's more which states have demonstrated a habit of wreaking physical horror in the streets that do not possess a nefarious cyber capability and how will they go out and try to procure it? Either from one of the cyber powers that I mentioned, or from one of the underground criminal networks. What will they be able to trade in order to get it? 

We talked about rules, rules of the road in terms of how all these countries deal with each other and how they might retaliate. There, of course, have been multiple reports now that our intelligence officials believed that this election may have been hacked, or was hacked to some degree, by the Russians in terms of the e-mails that were ultimately discovered and released. What is the proportional response? This has been the big topic in Washington. 

There are no doctrines of proportional response for the cyber domain that I'm aware of, which is why we have no deterrents in the cyber domain. We have small examples, right, North Korea hacked Sony, the response is sanctions. The Obama administration in its final weeks kicked a bunch of Russian diplomats out and added additional sanctions. There were some indictments of some Iranians that had hacked a dam in the U.S., so you have these sort of small examples, but none of these examples are enough to really change state behavior. So if you're writing sort of new rules of the game, and by the way, we have decades of experience around deterrents and proportional response and so forth, but if you're to write rules that really create this kind of -- 

What do the rules look like? What should they look like? 

It has to be something that changes behavior. For instance, if the goal is to get, you know, a country to not conduct corporate espionage, what can you -- what threat can be sort of posed that would cause them to essentially change their behavior? This all gets much more difficult in a world where attribution is so difficult. So I believe right now that all wars will begin as cyber wars. What's so dangerous about cyber wars or cyber incursions or cyber invasions, whatever you want to call them, is you may not know that you were attacked for several years. So we're used to a world in which a physical attack happens, in that moment in the Situation Room or wherever else, that retaliatory moment, where you say, here's what happened to us, what are the options, what are we going to do, what are the consequences? What happens when that comes two years later? What happens when it comes three years later? And so much has changed, the political will is no longer there, everybody's kind of moved on, but you get this smoking gun information, what do you do if you're the leader of a country in that moment? 

I want to also talk about the role of corporations, specifically technology corporations in terms of the balance of power between states and companies. Harvard Business Review had a piece out in the fall that said every corporation needs a foreign policy. Do you think about a foreign policy for Google, for Alphabet? 

I think foreign policy is the wrong word because these companies are inherently global. I think the right way to think about it is each company has its mission statement, and it needs a strategy for applying that mission statement around the world. So companies, again, they have mission statements and they have a set of core values. Where this gets interesting is historically, even in the last ten years, there's been a whole host of international security issues that didn't seem relevant to the companies and I think what we're finding now is every physical challenge has a digital manifestation, all the problems from the physical world are now spilling over online and it's just much better for companies to assume whatever problem exists in the world is something that they should be proactive in thinking about and understanding how their mission statement and their values applies to it. 

What happens when your program decides to put a toxicity score on a politician, dare I say like President Trump, or somebody else? 

The models themselves are imperfect, right, so we're putting these models -- so with Perspective, there will be false positives. So we'll run comments through Perspective and the scores that come back against some of the comments, in some cases will be wrong, and in this case, the users themselves can correct it, and it will help improve the model. But this is also why you apply multiple models and it's also why you end up using lots of different data sets. 

Thank you for a conversation that was non-toxic. 

Thank you. 

Jared, thank you, appreciate it.
