a predominantly black congregation destroyed by fire. Although no one was injured, investigators are calling it suspicious. This marks the fifth such fire in the last 10 days. There have been more than 30 over the last 18 months. Most are believed to be racially motivated cases of arson. Throughout the South, communities affected by these fires are demanding to know why it has taken so long for the rest of the country to pay attention. Now joining me for a better understanding of what has been happening and what is being done to prevent future tragedy, the assistant attorney general for Civil Rights, DEVAL PATRICK. He is leading the task force that is investigating the fires. Also here, Abe Rosenthal, a columnist for The New York Times. Mr. Assistant Attorney General, thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure to have you on the broadcast. 

Thank you. It's nice to be here. 

Tell me what you can tell us and my audience and Abe Rosenthal about what we know now about these burnings and who has been doing them and whether they are copycat or whether there's some kind of conspiracy-- all the questions that I'm sure you have been thinking about. 

Well, I can tell you some of the-- I can answer some of those questions. First of all, there are upwards of 200 federal agents working on this investigation together with state and local law enforcement throughout the South and elsewhere in the country and that's been true for better than a year now. This is the largest Civil Rights investigation going and one of the two or three largest federal criminal investigations of any kind going on. We have solved about 19 of the cases we have investigated over the last five years or so and that's with a combination of successful federal, successful state prosecutions. We have six arrests pending prosecution. To the question of whether there is or is not a conspiracy, in the legal sense, I won't answer that right now because so many of the investigations are ongoing. What I can say is that it is plain that racial hostility is driving many of the fires-- not all, but many of the ones that we have solved. We have made arrests of people who are members of the Klan. We were involved not very long ago in an investigation that led to the prevention of a fire against a large-- a conspiracy, really, to torch a large church in Los Angeles, involving the skinheads. So there are examples of our having prosecuted members of hate groups who are-- what I called ''the organized bigots,'' who are-- who are part of this. And there are also arrests we've made and prosecutions successfully of individuals who seem, in the main, to be acting on their own. 

Any linkage, in terms of-- it's not a conspiracy-- can tell us, is there any linkage at all that you see? 

Well, there clearly is linkage in the sense that many of the-- of the victim congregations have been of-- or many of the victim churches have been black churches in rural areas -- not all, but most -- and most in the Southeast. Again, not all. This is a problem that hasn't been limited to the Southeastern United States. It's been as far-flung as Seattle, Washington. We've had an incident in upstate New York, one in New Jersey, one in-- one in Chicago. I want to be clear, though, that I am not saying there is not a conspiracy. What I am saying is what I have consistently said, which is that with respect to ongoing investigations, it's premature for anyone to conclude one way or the other, as a law enforcement matter, about whether they-- about whether they form a legal conspiracy. But we are clearly investigating that and doing so aggressively. 

I want to bring Abe Rosenthal into this, but one last question that-- that comes up. The president has this week gone to and, in a moving speech, talked about this issue, as he sees it, some-- has the press, has white America, has the president and has the Justice Department been late in focusing on this, been late in bringing it to our attention with the full force of its powers? 

Well, let me first speak to the Justice Department. We have been very actively and aggressively investigating these fires for quite a while now. We have had investigations of this kind under way since I arrived at the Justice Department almost three years ago. We have had these many resources on the case for a little bit better than a year now. It's not customary in law enforcement in ongoing investigations to make public relations a part-- a part of that. So I think it is not correct to say that the federal response is late. I think that the president's response from the-- from the position of moral leadership has been, frankly, just wonderful and is exactly what I would want any-- any president who is showing leadership to do. And I think that's important. I think the press has come to this relatively recently, but they've come in force, as-- as they do. And I think, on the whole, that's been good. On the whole, I say, the only hesitation-- on the whole, it's been good because I think it's very important for the American public to see what is happening in other parts of our common community. I think that's key and I think it's important for people to understand what this symbolizes about the undertone, the climate in which so many of these incidents are arising and how much work we have yet to do to find our way to each other as common citizens in a common nation. 

Abe? 

I feel that-- in my stomach and I-- and in the stomachs of everybody I've talked to about this, there is-- really agrees with what I have had to say, which is not startling, but I think very important, that if these churches were white congregation churches or if they were synagogues or if they were Muslim mosques and they took place in a-- mostly in a specific area of the country, say the Northeast, this country-- whole country would be inflamed with rage and indignation. I'm not trying to pin the tail on the-- on the FBI, but I'm talking about this whole society. I feel that you must know this, and I think that Charlie must know this. Everybody must know-- seems to agree to it when I point it out to them, that the press would have responded far earlier. Incidentally, I left out only one thing, which I shouldn't have-- myself. I would have written about this earlier. Maybe you would have had a program about it earlier, Charlie. I think the press would have had a different kind of coverage. We have a lot of nice feature stories, but nobody's really yet done a-- the kind of investigation that they ought to be doing. I think the president would have talked out earlier. I think this would have been-- during the campaign, the Republican candidates would have said-- I mean, we all know this, that you can't not-- could not burn down however many there are -- and the figures vary -- synagogues, white churches or other-- or mosques around the country-- the figures-- you say 30. It depends how long you go back. I have other figures say-- National Council of Churches says 50. Another group says 80. The count is different. You could not do this. It could not have happened. There would have been a political issue. The politicians would have been having at it, correctly. The press would have been having at it. And as I say, if I were a black person-- a black man, I would say that's because it was black churches. 

Churches in rural communities. 

Right. In rural communities, but particularly black. Now, I'm not-- (crosstalk) 

You think there's something to that-- 

--but as a white man-- 

--other than-- 

--I say the same thing. 

Not speaking as the assistant attorney general, but as-- as a citizen, do you think there's something to that, Mr. Patrick? 

I think there's probably something-- something to the level of response and the outrage in the general public. I think-- I think that-- I certainly felt in almost three years in this job, trying to explain to people from as-- you know, as fancy types as-- as members of Congress to as common as-- as the-- as the members of my family back on the South Side of Chicago and cousins and so forth, that we still have a pressing moral question unresolved in this country around issues of race, has certainly taught me how-- how much work we have yet to do, how little-- much of the-- or some in the-- in the American public seem to-- seem to appreciate how much remains to be-- to be done. I certainly see, by what comes across my desk every day, the vileness and meanness of some of the acts that we, as citizens, still perpetrate on others because of differences. So I-- the point resonates with me, sure. I'm trying to be careful not to-- not to castigate an entire society for being late with something which I think now, having come whenever it has come, does reflect an appropriate moral outrage and I welcome that and welcome the attention of the American public that's been drawn by the government and, most importantly, by the citizens who've come to Washington and spoken up about this and folks in-- in the media, like Mr. Rosenthal, to this issue. 

Why churches? 

Why is it happening to churches? 

Yeah. 

I think people know, frankly, the profound importance of the church in the black community. I think people know that. They know that historically. And even if they're not students of history, they know because of the way-- because of the reverence that many people in the black community hold for their church and the-- and the way that the church adds a sense of community in many places where that is not generally very strong. I think that striking at a church has a particular devastation to it because it is clearly a strike at the soul of the black community. 

I have been all my life, really, critical of people who use racial rhetoric, extreme white supremacists or black supremacists or whatever-- Farrakhan-- I'm always having at him and I-- and I've-- and other people of other religions and I-- who have-- or colors who emphasize these things and who speak in derogatory ways because I think it has a ripple effect. I don't say it's a one-on-one effect, but if you set up an atmosphere of racial antagonism, whether it's anti-black or anti-Semitic or whatever, it has an effect on other people. And something in me also says that in the last years-- choose your own-- a couple of decades or whatever-- all-- the rhetoric involving certain public issues, whether you're for them or against them, like Affirmative Action and Welfare are big issues in America and they have some-- from them has come a hard-to-pin-down but definite rhetoric implying that this was a black problem, that Affirmative Action was not an American problem, it was really a-- it was a black one, that pregnant women-- all black or that-- that-- 

Or that crime has a black face. 

What? 

Or that crime has a black face. Those-- those-- 

Correct. And in the cities, it sometimes does-- in fact, often does in actuality. But that is not the same thing as portraying-- blacks do come out in American society as somehow poorer and more violent and more prone to do-- to be on Welfare, which is not true, generally, than whites. Without going into all the statistics about it, there is an atmosphere about it. I think the Willie Horton case is a good example. One guy out on parole, et cetera-- never should have been. I agree with that. But it becomes-- his picture is everywhere. So, I mean, as somebody who was always yakking away about this to the Farrakhans of the world, I really have to say I think there's an issue there, too. It's not an issue you can pin down. It's not an issue you can take to court, but there is something going on there which people ought to be aware of. And I think it contributed both to the burnings-- I don't see them-- there may not be a conspiracy, but there maybe is, some people say, a conspiracy of mindset. They-- they're not burning down city halls. They're burning down black churches. They're not burning down fire houses. They're burning down black churches and not other black buildings, necessarily. And that's a generality. I mean, that's a-- I'm sure there are a lot of variations that you could come up with. But I feel it very deeply and I feel it myself. I mean, why did I wait so long before coming out with it? Too busy on other things. Would I have waited this long if there were 80 synagogues or temples or white-- you bet your life I wouldn't have. So I was caught in the same kind of-- without mea culpa-- I'm not a mea culpa type. I'm (unintelligible) But I can't deny this. I mean, it's been going on a year. The president of the United States-- I'm glad he's talking out. Now the Republicans are hitting him because he's talking. That's ridiculous. My only-- my complaint about him is that he should have talked out a long time ago. What-- at what point do you talk out? 

I think we've all-- 

Twenty? Thirty? 

We have-- obviously, now that there has become a focus on this, people are saying, ''Where was I and where was the press and where was the-- where was the president?'' And a lot of other people are raising questions as to the focus. What surprises you most about this, Mr. Patrick? 

Well, I'd like to-- I'd like to say-- I guess I wish I had an answer for you. I don't feel as surprised as perhaps-- as perhaps I should or as I wish I were. I think that in some respects I-- in many respects, I agree with the point Mr. Rosenthal said. I feel as if we are-- we are reaping what we have sown in this country. The combination of neglect and-- and hostility generated from many, many quarters around many, many issues has caused us to-- to forget how to find our way to each other and how to see our stake in each other's struggles and rather to retreat into all kinds of blame and separateness. And I think that is not where the future of America can lie and where-- or where the best of America is. And I'm afraid that having had that tamped down in so many different ways for so long has produced a climate out of which these incidents arise. 

What is the talk within the black community? 

What is the-- 

Talk within the black community. 

Well, there are a couple of different things. I'll tell you that when the-- when the ministers came to see us over Sunday and Monday of this week-- 

Were they worried about what was being done? 

Very concerned about the-- about the-- about what they knew and didn't know about the federal response. There were some issues around sensitivities of federal agents in doing investigations and we are trying to address those. 

That-- Mr. Patrick, that brings up something you said a little while ago, is that the-- you know, the FBI, the Department of Justice do not make a big fuss about things they're investigating. Only sometimes. Every newspaper person knows or every press person knows and everybody in government knows that when the Department of Justice or the local district attorney or the police or whatever want to focus attention on things, on issues, and bring it to people's attention, they know how to do it. They know how to get hold of the press. They know how to say, ''This is an important issue'' without cutting across an investigation. They know. There's nobody more apt at bringing things to people's attention than the branches of government and I include the Department of Justice in this, not in a derogatory way. But I wish that they had made more of a fuss about it, in the way the Department of Justice can do if it really wants to. Doesn't involve you. It involves the whole Department of Justice. There was-- and the whole administration, really, of government structures. They could have put more attention on it and they didn't, for whatever reason. 

Well, let me-- I'd like to say something about that, Mr. Rosenthal. I think you're right that the-- that the department knows how to draw attention to something. I have to-- I want to be clear. What I was saying is that I saw my role and do see my role primarily as trying to solve these crimes, not trying to-- not trying to draw public relations attention or public attention to a problem we have not yet solved. But I-- your point's well taken. We do know how to-- we do know how to do it and the fact that we-- that we hadn't done it, I think, is quite a bit less significant, in my own mind, than the fact that the public's attention is now drawn to it and I think we can-- we can make-- we can make that a positive and constructive thing. 

And-- but back to what you were saying about the black ministers, when they came to see you and when they came to Washington. 

Well, they-- they raised a number of concerns. They were concerned about reports or rumors and so forth that-- that the investigation had dismissed sort of out of hand the notion that there might be some link, as a matter of law and fact, among the fires, which is not true. They were concerned-- 

It's not true that you've dismissed the possibility of linkage? 

Absolutely not. We are actively investigating those kinds of issues in each of these investigations. That's right. 

Thank you very much for coming. I know how busy you are and I thank you for coming to talk about where this thing stood. 

Thanks for having me on. 

It's a pleasure to have you on the broadcast. Abe, thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you, as well. We'll be right back. HAYNES JOHNSON is here, and DAVID BRODER. We'll talk about the system in Washington and how they see it
