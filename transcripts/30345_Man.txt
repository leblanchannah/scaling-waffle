Freida Pinto is here. Her acting debut took place in Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film "Slumdog Millionaire." It earned her much critical praise. She now stars in the upcoming Showtime miniseries "Guerrilla." The series follows a young couple who become political radicals in London during the 1970's. Here is a look at the trailer. (MUSIC) 

What was your last job? 

I taught English to immigrants. There was a misunderstanding. 

What kind of misunderstanding? 

I'd lobbied to make changes which were interpreted-- 

So you are a troublemaker? I don't think we have anything for you. (MUSIC) 

Don't give up. (MUSIC) (LAUGHTER) 

Hey! 

We were just on our way home -- 

You two are pissed up! Do you want to get yourself nipped? 

Just leave him alone. 

Hey! (YELLING) (MUSIC) (CRYING) (MUSIC) 

We need to do something. 

We can't devolve into violence. 

Whatever happens next, it starts with working for change. (MUSIC) 

This is all the police see. What we need is people who believe in what we believe. (MUSIC) 

To the people with the guns goes the power. You think you are free but you are not. 

We're up for something, if we're up for each other, now is when we have got to show it. I need your help. We are going to liberate a political prisoner. 

You're going to bust a convict out of prison. 

This is a really foolish idea. 

They are changing the laws on us. One day, people are going to ask us what we did. I'm not gonna tell them I sat on fence! (MUSIC) (GUNSHOT) (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) 

You cool? 

We're so (expletive) cool. (MUSIC) The government lies to you! It oppresses you! 

What we do has to be about ideals. We want the police to be held accountable. (MUSIC) 

Leaders, if that's what's required, then that's what we will be. 

You are here because you are black. We are the children of the colonies who built this empire on the backs of their labor. Strong in our pride. (MUSIC) 

They're soldiers and soldiers fight. (MUSIC) 

We are going to give them something to remember. 

Did you tell the police where to find us? 

Just trying to keep you from getting killed. 

This is the declaration of the state of war. (MUSIC) To the oppressed, know that you don't struggle alone. (MUSIC) Power to the people. (MUSIC) 

I am pleased to have Freida Pinto back at this table. Welcome. 

Thank you, thank you so much. 

This is a series. 

Yes, it is a miniseries, six episodes. 

And you play Jas. 

Jas Mitra. 

Yes. 

Jas Mitra, she's -- 

She is the evolution of a radical? 

She is one-half of the revolutionary couple, Jas and Marcus, who we follow through the entire series. And it is really about -- it's set in 1970's, the 1971 Immigration Act, which really impacts a lot of the decisions and the actions which has consequences. But it is really about this relationship under pressure. 

And Idris plays Kent. 

Idris plays Kent. He plays my ex-lover. 

Who comes back for -- 

To create some trouble. (LAUGHTER) 

To create trouble, yes. 

Yes. 

But it is about the evolution of political radicalism in the '70s, in London? 

In London, yes. And it is actually based on facts that even I was not aware of, something that I thought when I first read the pilot episode, I wanted to verify the authenticity of all of it. So I go on to Google and I typed the 1971 Immigration Act. And there is information but it is not as well documented as the Civil Rights Movement or the Black Panther Movement. 

We have actors coming to this table all the time who say the best work they see, the best script, the best text, the best characters is on television. 

Yes. I have to admit that is kind of true. This is my first ever T.V. show. It didn't feel like I was filming a T.V. show because it felt like too really intense, independent films that I shot back-to-back, especially working with someone like John Ridley. But the kind of -- 

Who wrote the screenplay. 

Who wrote this, yes, and directed three of the six episodes as well. But I kind of feel like with this particular one, I now understood why actors love television. You get this extra time to go deeper into your characters, which sometimes it can be rush, rush, rush in a film. 

She tells Kent in episode one, I have to be with someone who wants to do things, as to why she is no longer with him. 

Yes. I think she does not know how to be neutral or quiet in the face of injustice, and that, you know, as we go on the episodes we will find out that it really comes from her father as well. 

Who is in prison, was he not? 

A political prisoner in India. And she really is actually, you know, fighting for her right in England to be a part of, you know, I don't know how much you know about the Immigration Act but according to the 1971 Immigration Act, which by the way, is not yet repealed even today, people who came from the colonies, so mainly from the countries of Africa and Asia, were under the threat of being deported and sent back to their country, called non-patriols. And so she's really fighting for her right and her right to be in England and work. 

And so what is her relationship with her boyfriend Marcus? 

He definitely is someone like she says, you know, Marcus wants to do things, I want to be with someone who wants to do things. I definitely think he is the -- he is the more understanding, less volatile, compared to Jas. And they balance each other off in that sense, or balanced each other off in that sense really well. But now they're also at a point in their relationship -- which we see in almost every relationship and they don't have to be political for that, or radicalized for that -- there comes a time where you really question if you are really up for each other and they actually reached that point. So the start of the series, they are already in a difficult place in their relationship and then they do something that questions their faith in each other even more. 

And then Kent comes back too. 

And then Kent comes back to make it even more difficult, which, you know, you will find out in later episodes that she does not share that information with Marcus. 

Is she prepared for the life of a political radical? 

I don't think so. I think she, in her mind, she knows and she is determined to stand up for what she believes in. But as I was filming the series, I thought about it and I go, oh, there is so much of this that she did not even see coming her way, but she bravely went ahead and did what she wanted to because she believed in it. And much like, not just Jas, but even Marcus, and all of the group of people that come together to form this underground cell, they really are operating out of, really not knowing, playing each moment as it comes. And, you know, there are surprises along the way. And one of the things that John always said in any revolution, any movement, there are actions that people take because they believe in that point in time that is the right thing to do. And if you don't account for consequences, you are going to be majorly surprised, and I think that's what Jas and Marcus find themselves in. 

When Danny Boyle, we talked about this before, casts you in "Slumdog,". 

Yes. 

Had you done much television or films? 

I hadn't done anything. 

You were simply a model in India. 

I used to model and did this travel show. I hated modeling because it was just not something that interested me. So I did this travel show and I traveled all over southeast Asia for nine months, fascinating. 

A nice gig if you get it. 

It is a nice gig, right, and why not, like a paid holiday and get to learn about different cultures and there was an open casting call and that's what I went into. 

How many in the open casting call? 

I don't know the exact number but I believe they ran into thousands and it was not just in Bombay, the city that I grew up in, but Mumbai. I believe it was all over India, Deli, Calcutta, even England and America. 

So if you grew up in Bombay. 

Yes. 

And then became Mumbai. 

Yes. 

Do you still refer to it as Bombay or have you sort of become used to Mumbai? 

I kind of use Mumbai for people who get confused when I am talking about Bombay being the exact same city. And I was born in 1984, it was Mumbai in 1996. And I was so used to calling it Bombay. And for me, a lot of the city that I see is, in my head, still Bombay. So I have still have not made a complete association or rather the dissociation from Bombay and moved into Mumbai fully, I haven't done it. So, yes, when I talk to the press, I try to say Mumbai as much as I can because that is the right name. 

Is it India's most interesting city? 

I think the people from New Delhi would come charging after me if I said -- 

I think of that as a government seat rather than -- 

Yes, that would be, yes. I would say it is a fascinating city in terms of the extremes that you will see. You see that in almost every other part of India but in Bombay or Mumbai, there is no escaping it. As soon as you land into the city, you are bombarded by, your senses are just assaulted right away. And in that sense, it is really extreme. There is slow and fast happening at the exact same time and somehow you have to cope with it. 

My impression is I see more Indian, more actors who are born in India of Indian origin doing well. 

Yes. 

Prominent in terms of global cinema. 

Yes. I have to say every time I meet people I go, there is 1.2 billion people in India, if you are telling me that we are a country without talent, I take it as a big offense. So I am really happy. I think it is finally happening. And talent is getting drawn into like people coming to India to film a lot in India. I mean, the success of all of the films that have happened in the last couple of years and will continue to happen that used India as its backdrop, and as well as Indian actors and talent and musicians moving into the West, Hollywood, England, everywhere. I think it feels appropriate. 

And what did your friends and others say to you after the stunning success of "Slumdog Millionaire?" What did they say to you? 

Well -- 

Did they say to you, choose carefully? Did they say, you got to do something very different than what you just did? Did they say to you -- 

I don't think my friends were involved in that decision-making process, but I was. And I think one of the things that I realized, you know, I was not prepared, but I did realize something, is that what I have been given is great. I work for it but it's a gift. It comes once in a lifetime and when it comes in a lifetime, you've got to grab it with both hands and make the most of it. And the first number one thing that I said to my agents was even if it means not getting paid or working in smaller films, I don't want to be stereotyped. 

So what did you do? 

So I consciously steered away from every project that would be -- and it happens, it doesn't -- I don't know if it happens as much now because I definitely don't get scripts like that anymore. But you get these stereotypical Indian roles, you know, and mostly it was about the women trying to get married. And their whole life was centered around having the perfect arranged marriage. And that is not who I am. I am 32 years old, I'm not married, and my parents don't force me to marry. And I don't believe that all of India is in the way that that one person sees the stereotypical vision. So one of the things I did was stay away from that. So my second film -- and also the other thing I tried to stay away from was getting stereotyped as just the pretty girl in every film of the cardboard cutout. I did get caught in that bubble for a while as much as I tried my best. But my second film was the very politically charged film "Miral" with Julian Schnabel. 

Right. 

Which kind of got a lot of flack for whatever reason, you are talking about Israel and Palestine. 

Real life story, sort of. 

Exactly. Good luck to anyone who takes on that subject matter. 

Yes. 

But that is what I wanted to do. And I am glad, I am glad, you know, even if the film wasn't widely well received. I am glad I did not do a blockbuster right away and get lost in the -- 

Your charitable work is important to you? 

Very important to me. I get asked all the time how much time is the charitable work or I really actually don't even like calling it charitable work. I like calling it social responsibility. How much of my time is for social responsibility work and how much time is acting and I go, I say kind of like it seeps into each other, even if I don't try to, it is 50-50. I just did this pilot run for a project that I wanted to try out in Los Angeles for a food recovery program, simply because I live in that city, I have been there for five years, and I walk around that city and I see the homelessness and food being wasted. 

You see homeless and people who need food and you see food being wasted. 

And then you see mansions. 

Right. 

And just these big Hollywood parties, which I am saying by all means, I am not saying don't celebrate and don't go throw a big party to celebrate your film or films, but let's have a little bit of purpose at the end of this party like where is this food going, you know, that consciousness that we need to have. And so as I asked this question around, it seemed like it was going into a trash can. Some places did actually serve their food out to the homeless population but most often it was not connected anywhere. So I called upon a friend who works in San Francisco. Her name is Komal Ahmad, who runs this company called Copia, and she has been doing it for five years. I love the company name. It is like the horn of plenty, cornucopia. And she said okay, fine, let's draw up a pilot project and ran it around Oscar weekend. And we covered 1,366 pounds of excess food, edible food that would have been wasted, and served more than 1,100 people in Los Angeles. 

Good for you. 

We are hoping to roll it out into a fully fledged program to serve the studios and productions that happen in Los Angeles. 

What is the next film? 

What is the next film? I have a very -- an Indie film but one I am very excited about because my friend worked on it for 11 years, it is called "Love Sonia." It is Tabrez Noorani who was a line producer of "Slumdog" and has produced "Life of Pi" and many other films that shoot in India. And it's a story about the sex trafficking racket that starts in India, moves to Hong Kong, and then into Los Angeles. And again, based on true stories of actual girls who have been trafficked on that racket. So I am very excited about it. I play this really crazy prostitute who is mean to the new girl who arrives at the Brothel. And I'm actually, I have to say, after what, nine, eight years of being in this industry, I am finally being given more mature, more serious roles. And it took two and a half years of not working at all to go into like deep anxiety of like, is it over? 

You mean you turned down things? 

I turned down things and then, you know, people forget when you turn them down over and over again. And it took a lot of patience and getting over, and dealing with the anxiety of this industry to finally arrive at Guerrilla" and "Love Sonia. 

Great to have you back. 

Thank you so much. 

Good to see you. 

Thank you, thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
