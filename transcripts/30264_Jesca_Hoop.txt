Good evening. I'm Anthony Mason filling in for Charlie Rose. Jesca Hoop is here, the California born, Manchester, England, based musician is best known for her raw and original songwriting. Her new album, "Memories Are Now," is being called a return to her oddly structured songs and daring rhythmic turns. Rolling Stone Magazine writes, "Hoop has recaptured her quixotic romanticism, and it is swooningly lovely. Here is Jesca Hoop performing Pegasi in our studio. 

You've found a map to my heart, it led you to the well. You combed at my mane. I'll wear your saddle and reigns. With all these stars at my feet I'll stamp and tap the spring. With my rider and mount I feel like spreading my wings. Take to the sky like poetry. When we're in love we're alive. You're the envy of the sky. Every ember wants to ride the supernova. But I fear you'll see the day when I've endured all I can take. I won't bend but I will break under the weight. Because you broke within me what others could not tame, I'll summon the wind and do your bidding day by day. With your firm strong hand go steady towards the north. We are a thing of beauty lead by the fires of iron ore. Your good old girl was built to soar. When we're in love we're alive. You're the envy of the sky. Every ember wants to ride the supernova. But I fear you'll see the day when I've endured all I can take. I won't bend but I will break under the weight. Dying star, dying star, dying star. Though many love lit moons, I served my rider well. I suffered the bit and took his spur into my side. Still I paid the price and I shook that bridle free, and my beloved rider fell from the stars into the sea. You're of the earth, I'm Pegasi. When we're in love we're alive, you're the envy of the sky. Every ember wants to ride the supernova. But I fear you'll see the day when I've endured all I can take. I won't bend but I will break under the weight. Dying star, dying star, dying star. 

And I am pleased to welcome Jesca Hoop to the table for the very first time. Welcome. 

Thank you so much for having me. 

It's great to have you here. The album, as we mentioned, is called "Memories Are Now." I love that title and I love that phrase. And you've said that that song is -- that title song is actually kind of a bit of medicine for you. 

It is. 

How so? 

When I started writing the songs I sort of thought -- I did think about it like lifting curses. Not that I am superstitious. 

Right. 

But I am romantic. So I approached it like lifting curses. And the title track, "Memories Are Now," is a cast of affirmations -- 

Right. 

-- that helped me work through blocks. 

Right. Part of the lyric is "I've learned enough life, I've earned my stripes, clear the way, I'm coming through. 

That's my knife in the ground. This is mine. 

You've had such an interesting path, which started in California; right, growing up in a Mormon family with four brothers and sisters. 

I'm in the middle of five. 

In the middle of five. 

And I broke the chain. 

You broke the chain. 

I did. 

How did you break the chain? 

I think good fortune. I met a friend. I met a friend who was my first chosen friend. My parents were also splitting at the time, so I kind of found out. I was going to church, like, every day. 

Yeah. 

Every day, and then sometimes twice a day. So that's all I knew. But then I started to see other things through other people. My first chosen friend, her name was Julie. ANTHONY HOOP: Yeah. And her parents were atheists, and just this little seed of a thought entered, hey, I'm not supposed to be friends with people outside my church, but her parents are kind of okay, so why don't I give this a little bit more thought. And then I told my -- once they split, I told my parents, I was just like, "I'm not going to church anymore." 

Yeah. 

And they were interested in reestablishing their lives. 

You were how old at this point? 

I think I was 14. I was 14. 

That's a pretty big thought at 14. 

I'm capable of big thoughts. 

But you end up -- you end up basically leaving home at what age? How old were you? 

Well I kind of came and went for a little while at 15. You know, when you're taught that life is this thing and then all of a sudden something completely different -- 

Comes along, yeah. 

Yeah. Then you find yourself navigating. 

Did you run out to find that? Is that what you did? 

No. I just found myself in the throes of not understanding adult life at all. 

Were you already writing songs at this point. 

I had just started around that time. I think when my mother moved out and I started walking a longer stretch to school, I mean I had so much walking to do, so I was- 

Because you were staying with your dad. 

I was staying with my dad. 

Yeah. 

And I had these long stretch, and I'd just entertain myself through making these really long drawn out, like, five songs in one song kind of, you know, non-structured, just rambling. 

Yeah. 

And melodies. 

Melodies? 

Yeah, I do remember concentrating on melodies, because I didn't know anything about structure. And there's no theory in my musicality, really, in my, you know, practice any anyway. 

Right. 

I do have some technical training from my mother who was an amateur coloratura soprano. And from my childhood perspective, she was amazing. 

Yeah. 

And my father was a full conthusiest, so I was enthused with music from my family, and also from the church. And by the time I was, like, kind of no longer being paid attention to, you know, my parents were off doing their thing -- I was just doing lots of riding and skating, skateboard. I used to ride a skateboard. And just writing songs. 

Right. So you end up -- 15, or so, you start kind of going off to places. And then, I mean, you end up on the road working and living for quite a while. 

After rambling for some time, I was in the wilderness for a while, working in a wilderness program, and I was like, thinking to myself, I'm not making use of what I feel is my strongest set of tools and what makes me the happiest, so I decided to climb off the mountain, high mountain desert, Arizona, and go back to California and start a band, fix up the house, and then go from there. And pursue music. But that was quite late. 

You end up getting a job at Tom Waits. 

By some magical means. 

As his nanny to his three kids, and his wife's three kids. 

It is true, and a very, very long time ago. And to be honest with you, I don't really speak about it, because I find that the most precious things you need to hold in a quiet place. 

I understand. You have said, I think, that there were a couple people who really, at key moments, were like stones that you climbed onto in the water. 

Yes. 

And that was one of those moments. 

Yes. I was very, very fortunate that my path crossed with some amazing people who helped me. I was just this -- I was a country kid who had no vision of a bridge, how to build a bridge between this rural living and the stages around the world, or even a way to make a record. So in those early days I was very fortunate to meet some amazing people who helped me get started on right path for the long game. 

Yeah. He put in a good word for your music. He said your music is like going swimming in a lake at night, which is a wonderful image. You ended up getting a lot of exposure also on a California station, KCRW, Seed of Wonder particularly, got a lot of notice. 

That's actually where -- I was trying to figure out where to move, and I had recorded this little batch of songs. And my publisher, who has been with me now for 12 years, back then, before he signed me, he sent my first recordings to Nick Harcourt at KCRW. And I was sleeping in my van. I was saving money -- 

Yeah. 

-- so I was sleeping in my van, and I was going to move to either New York or L.A. And Nick Harcourt calls me and said people want to know about this six-and-a-half minute weird song. 

Yeah. 

And so I moved. I just went where the going was going. 

Yeah. 

And I went to L.A. 

Where did that take you, when you started to get some attention from that song? 

It's strange, because it kind of took me from an open door to shut doors and -- 

Interesting. 

You know, my passage has been -- it's been like a kind of a bloom that's kind of like this, and it's a very slow burning. 

Right. 

Burning fire. But it took me to L.A., where I lived all around the city, and to building a network of musicians. It took me to Tony Berg, who helped me make my first three records. 

Right. The second stone that you said you climbed up on was when you got a phone call from the lead singer of the band Elbow. 

I'm actually going to say my first stone was my publisher, Len Conway, and my second stone was Tony Berg. 

Okay. 

Because it's very important to note that the work is the most important thing. Celebrity and musicians and friends and endorsements is all good, but it's nothing without the people that help you get to work with. 

Yeah. That's true, yeah. 

But he called me up. We did this interview, and that led to a friendship. 

And you end up in Manchester, England, where Elbow, the band, is from. 

Yeah. They kind of rule over there. 

Uh-huh, they do. 

They do. They do. It's pretty awesome. 

That's quite a switch. 

It's a total switch, and a complete culture, and I had no idea what I was really in for. I mean, in a small way, in my own personal way, I had no idea what I was giving up moving from California to Manchester. 

It was a difficult adjustment at first. 

It was, yeah. I mean, it was so exciting. I had no ties and I had fallen in love, and I was -- and I thought -- and it is true that working in England is a -- it's -- I don't know. It's smaller and it assists you in some ways in its smallness. 

Because it feels more intimate, more -- 

It's easier to reach. 

Yeah. 

The United States is so big and to reach the different markets, for lack of a better word, to reach your people it's harder, because they're everywhere and they're spread out. 

Yeah. 

And so in England they're tied together by a few sources rather than so many. So I was excited to go and take another crack at building on this music thing, and after hitting some walls in the States. And then I just realized we speak the same language but this is not the same country. We're so different. We're so different. I've been there for ten years now. 

Yeah. Is there much of Manchester in your music? 

I don't know. I don't know. I wrote this whole record in Manchester, and nowhere else. It all came in my little house in Manchester. But I can't tell. 

You did this record with Blake Mills, who is a terrific guitarist and great producer. 

Absolutely. 

And where were you going with this new record? 

Well, with the writing I was -- someone called the other day, an album of protest songs. I think that's because we're in the spirit of it. 

Yes. 

But when I began to take that on board, I thought, you're right, every song is confrontational, in a gentle way, I think. 

Some of it is confrontational with yourself. 

Yes. Memories are now is me battling with my own doubts, you know, or my own willingness to give up. 

Which you clearly haven't done. 

I won't. I won't. I think it's a mean joke, too, sometimes when they tell you not to give up. They tell you if you just hang in there. I don't know. I think it's a mean joke. But where we were going with this record, I gave a lot of that over to Blake. I wanted to see where see where he would guide the process, and I really gave so much over. And he wanted to strip it way back down. 

It is easy for you to give over to a producer? 

Yeah. Because I want to be used like raw material. 

Interesting. 

I want to be -- I want to enter in and be malleable and see what someone else can draw out of me. I'm always really wanting that. I perform, I think, my best when it's being asked of me. I think that's the Mormon in me, the religious little girl. 

And what do you think came out this time? 

Of this record? 

Yes. 

Well I think it's very confidence building. This one feels like -- and I can't say it's perfect. I don't necessarily believe in perfection. But I think I'm communicating very clearly, and in ways that I haven't before, and also about things that I'm passionate about. 

That's got to feel good. 

Yeah. I'm particularly pleased with the last song. And someone the other day in an interview called it harsh on religion. 

The coming. 

I don't consider it harsh. I consider some of the things that it's addressing harsh. And by any stretch of the imagination is my address any less than appropriate. 

The album is "Memories Are Now." Jessica Hoop, thank you so much for being here. 

My pleasure. 

We leave you with another tune from the album. Here is "Songs of Old." 

Turn the key in the iron lock of the old oak door. Lean into its passages with all my weight and enter. Immediately my olfactory senses, it's home, paper thin and paraffin with a glimmering gold. Marble hands are pouring water. Silver wings deliver wishes. Streams of colored light make hallow home. Mama's singing the songs of old. Mama's singing the songs of old. Singing the rock of ages. Though the gold is marred by red, singing the rock of ages. Melt it down and make it new things. Singing the rock of ages. Empires are made this way, singing the rock of ages. Heyaya yaya yaya. Heyaya heya ayah. Heyaya yaya. Hey yaya yaya. Endless hopes and endless fears polish this stone. The deeper desire, the fine of the grain, this time I walk the stairway. And turn the key in the cellar door. I want to know why. All these stories never spoken, danced or drawn or sung or written, how we built this temple song by song. Mama's singing the songs of old. Mama's singing the songs of old, singing the rock of ages. Though the gold is marred by red, singing the rock of ages. Melting down and make new things, singing the rock of ages. Empires are made this way, singing the rock of ages. Mama's singing the songs of old, singing the rock of ages. Though the gold is marred by red, singing the rock of ages. Melt them down and make new things, singing the rock of ages. An empire is made this way, singing the rock of ages. Heyyaya yaya, heyyaya. Heyaya yaya, heyyaya. Heyyay yaya, heyyaya. Heyyaya. Heyyaya yaya. Heyyayayaya.
