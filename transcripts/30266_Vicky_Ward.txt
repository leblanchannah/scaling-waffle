Good evening. I'm William Cohan filling in for Charlie Rose. Rebekah Mercer is the billionaire heiress who not only provided pivotal financial support for Donald Trump when his campaign was flailing last summer but suggested he hire Steve Bannon who worked at Breitbart News, the media organization part owned by the Mercer family and Kellyanne Conway, who had also worked for the Mercers, said to be hugely instrumental on the transition executive committee and responsible for several key appointments, many people have asked just who is this 43-year-old woman? Joining me now is Vicky Ward, an investigator reporter and correspondent for "The Huffington Post's Highline Magazine," who has spent four months reporting on a piece about Mercer that was published today. It is called the "Blow-it-all-up Billionaires." Welcome, Vicky Ward. This is an honor for me, a pleasure to have my former "Vanity Fair" colleague here at this table, as Charlie Rose would say. This is an incredible piece of journalism. 

Thank you. 

I can tell you spent a lot of time on it. Can you just tell us, start by telling us who are these people? Who are the Mercers, because they've suddenly appeared out of what seems like nowhere, and yet we should know more about them? 

What's really unusual about the Mercers, and particularly Rebekah Mercer, who, you know, has become the mouthpiece of her far more reclusive billionaire father. 

Who was a hedge fund manager. 

Right. Well, he's a former scientist. 

Turned hedge fund manager. 

Turned hedge fund manager. So only made his billions, you know, relatively late in life, in his 50s. So unlike most of the other mega political donors, Rebekah Mercer is essentially a housewife without a big business of her own to run, who is in a position to really, then, you know, get involved, in a detailed way, in the Trump campaign, in the details, then as we saw on the Trump transition team -- I mean, you didn't see any of the Trump donors sitting around. 

On the executive committee. 

Yes. In that kind of way. But what's really different about the Mercers is not only did they lobby very hard to have their preferred candidate and people they knew very well to, then, work with him, they actually want to blow up the system, the whole political system. They wanted to blow up the republican establishment. And the vehicle through which they wanted to do that was this, originally, British data science firm, SCL, that was renamed -- the American arm has been renamed Cambridge Analytica. And the reason that that's important is that the way the sort of political system works is that all these data science companies that are used in all political campaigns, in America, traditionally, are affiliated with either the Republican Party or the Democrats. What the Mercers did, particularly I think after they saw Mitt Romney's loss in 2012. And that was when Rebekah Mercer first got noticed. 

I mean, didn't they back some wacky congressman candidate who -- 

Yes. 

-- collecting urine to try to -- 

Yes, yes! 

-- to change people's longevity. 

Well, it all starts with Citizens United. 

Of course. 

That decision, of course. 

That's a very important point. There would literally be no Mercers -- 

Correct. 

-- as we know them today without Citizens United. Could you talk about that? 

Completely important, because -- and, in fact, in the piece I have, one person, David Magerman, on the record, who spoke out to "The Wall Street Journal" and then was suspended from Renaissance Technologies. 

Incredibly. For criticizing Robert Mercer. 

Right. For criticizing Robert Mercer. And, you know, he said that, you know, they were all slightly crazy at Renaissance Technologies. They're all slightly wacky anti-establishment people who all have crazy views. Robert Mercer really used to say quite publicly that, you know, he believed that people who earned very little money had very little value to society. So he was critical of teachers. Critical of teachers. 

I mean, that is astounding to me. 

It is. 

Just because they don't make enough money. 

They don't make enough money. You know, so he would say things like this, and inside the firm, but David Magerman said, "You know, we're all slightly crazy inside Renaissance Technologies." No one thought really that this mattered, that sort of Robert Mercer was the kind of person who preferred speaking to cats than to humans. So as long as he had spoke to his cats, all of this was fine. But then, when Citizens United, when that decision gets passed, of course -- 

Which allowed unlimited amount of money being spent for political campaigns. 

For individuals, I think -- 

That changed the whole political landscape. 

It changed the landscape. And the Mercers, their first test run I believe was in Oregon with this doctor, Arthur Robinson, who was affiliated with this organization, and very proudly so, that collected vials of urine, you know, to believe it could prolong life. And no one had heard of this man. But they saw that their money -- 

Could have an effect. 

-- really had an effect. And that changed everything. From there, they brought -- they invested in Breitbart, which is, of course, where they come across Steve Bannon. And Steve Bannon earns their trust, you know, Andrew Breitbart dies. Steve Bannon does a lot, I think, to rectify the health of -- the financial health of Breitbart, and expands its platform quite dramatically. 

And that impressed the Mercers. 

Yes. And also, I mean, what I get into in the piece, which I found very interesting, is that quite a few of the sort of republican consultants I talked to mentioned that Steve Bannon, until going into the White House, often appeared dressed like a homeless person. And, in fact -- 

He still kind of looks like he's dressed like a homeless person. 

Well he wears a suit and a tie. But, you know, the number of photographs we've seen of him in his track pants and sort of, you know, all disheveled. And one of Ted Cruz's political consultants said to me, it's actually a very brilliant strategy in this very strange kind of Rubik's Cube-like world of uncomfortable co-dependencies that makes up the political world, because if you're a political consultant, you want the donors who you're so reliant on to just focus on your brain, to what's inside your -- you know, on your strategy. You don't want them suddenly looking at your cufflinks or how you eat a bread roll or things like that. That can make a huge difference. They can abandon you because of things like that. So, like, turning up looking like a homeless person maybe, I think, obviously, worked extremely well for Steve Bannon. 

So let's step back a little bit. 

Yeah. 

Because I think Renaissance Technologies and Jamie Simons and Robert Mercer, this is a big hedge fund. Jamie Simons is usually the highest -- one of the highest paid, if not the highest paid, hedge fund manager year in and year out. Obviously Robert Mercer was his right-hand guy and made a lot of money himself. 

Right. 

Has a few toys, right? 

Right. 

A big yacht. There's a great scene in here about them going out to Fisher's Island, right? 

Yes. 

But Rebekah Mercer, who is his, what, 43-year-old daughter -- 

The middle daughter. 

The middle daughter, she -- just explain, because she's got this -- she not only worked at Renaissance for a few years. I'd like to know what she did there. 

Right. 

But she also has, like, a cookie company. So, and then as a side light, she's, like, trying to overthrow what we think of the Republican Party orthodoxy. 

Correct. 

So this is a very complex woman that you seem to have captured very well in this piece, I think. 

Right, so she did work two or three years, I believe, at Renaissance. I don't think on the trading desk. 

She has a Stanford degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Yes, but I'm not sure -- Again, I don't think David Magerman was actually one of her bosses. And put it this way, I don't think -- I mean, it ended not so well. 

Right. And perhaps a bit of nepotism got her there. 

Right. And she certainly, by the time 2010 Citizens United came and the Mercers were finding out what money could do for them in the political sphere, had enough time on her hands. I mean, I know she does home school her four children, but she had enough time on her hands to go all in. And she would attend these freedom summits that, you know, the Koch network, David Bossie. 

Who is another important player in this story. 

Yes. 

Because he was the head of Citizens United. 

Head of Citizens United. 

So there's a direct link, then, between Citizens United, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, Trump. 

Right. No, Dave Bossie is actually very important interconnecter in all of them. Dave Bossie, I believe, is the person who introduced -- the person who first introduced, at these summits, the Mercers to Donald Trump. He didn't know them very well. But over the years, I mean, that's how he got to know Steve Bannon. That's how he got to know Kellyanne Conway. It's also how he got to know the Mercers. They would all talk. But Rebekah Mercer, I think, found these summits frustrating, and she thought they were too soft on immigration and on trade. She also, you know, thought that no one paid enough attention to her. So -- and she -- 

Because is she an egomaniac? Does she need the attention? 

Well, put it this way, even people who would call themselves supporters and friends of hers call her "a force." 

A force. 

A force. 

Is that a euphemism for something? 

Well I think she's clearly a very assertive personality. And someone who would definitely consider themselves a friend of her's said, you know, she perhaps has low EQ, which means that, you know, obviously means she has low EQ, she doesn't read a room well. And what's she interested in is politics, is her agenda, and getting it across. And she first got herself really noticed after the Mitt Romney loss in 2012, when she stood up at the University Club in New York and berated the room for saying, you know, he had a terrible canvassing and data operation, you know, and sort of scolded them all, and everyone was sort of like, who is this woman? 

There's some great details in this story, and I just want to talk about some of those quickly. You can talk about them. You know, Bannon, Steve Bannon being in charge of Biosphere 2. 

Yes. 

I don't know whether it was the scientific experiment out in the desert. He changed the locks. They ended up breaking -- the scientists broke the seal on Biosphere 2 so they could get out, because Steve Bannon had essentially locked them in. I mean, and -- okay, go ahead talk about that. 

I mean, really, the point of bringing up Biosphere 2 was to show that Steve Bannon is -- 

Is a complicated guy. 

Well, he has a history of -- he's very good at coming in and taking -- he was brought into Biosphere 2 as a banker. 

Right. Formerly went to Goldman and his own firm? 

Yes. And he ended up running it. And he has an appeal to very rich people. He obviously has a charisma there. They end up trusting him. And Ed Bass, the billionaire who felt that this project was being completely mismanaged, I mean, brought him in to fix it. And I believe that when that -- yes, I mean, the other thing that is notable with Steve Bannon, there's always quite a lot of drama. So the way that the old regime had to be sort of removed and he could take over, did involve armed federal marshals. 

Nice. Thanks, Steve. 

So it's -- you know, I mean he is -- 

But he did sort of a similar thing with, you know, with getting out -- getting the Mercers and himself, Kellyanne Conway out of the Ted Cruz camp into the Donald Trump camp, at just the right moment, right, and taking over that campaign. Supposedly fixing that after the Paul Manafort, you know -- 

Well I think the thing that really struck the Cruz campaign about Steve Bannon -- and, you know, many of these people are obviously great personal friends -- was that -- and I think they wonder to this day if he had not realized until the spring of last year that Ted Cruz was born in Canada, because Steve Bannon was, you know, supposedly with the Mercers, and they had all agreed that Ted Cruz would be the candidate. But suddenly Breitbart wrote, I think, 61 articles mentioning the fact that Ted Cruz was no longer electable because he was born in Canada. And the Cruz campaign and Senator Cruz called and said -- you know, called the Mercers, said -- 

What are you doing? 

-- what's going on? And Rebekah Mercer said, "Oh, I have to be -- you know, I have to let Steve do his thing. I have to be fair and impartial." And it was also quite clear, I think, by then, that Steve Bannon had said to the Mercers, who then applied a lot of pressure to Ted Cruz, that they felt Ted Cruz wasn't close enough to Jeff Sessions' positions on trade and immigration, and he had to -- sort of was asked to move his policies closer to Jeff Sessions. They complained about a "Wall Street Journal" op-ed he'd co-authored with Paul Ryan, saying that he was pro-free trade. They complained about that. And Bannon was definitely sort of whispering in their ear on that one. And then when Trump, during the primaries, came out with his, you know, Muslim ban, Rebekah Mercer said to Ted Cruz, she'd give him these dressing downs after each debate, which I think the Cruz campaign found difficult to swallow -- 

You would think. 

-- because Senator Cruz was, after all, a debate champion from Princeton, I believe. So, but she told him that, you know, his positions on immigration were no -- you know, needed to move closer to Trump's, and, indeed, to the base. So he came out with this policy about H1B visas, and there would be a 90-day period where H1B visa holders, you know -- 

So Trump wins. 

Yeah. 

Success has many fathers. Everybody's claiming that they had a role and they were responsible for his victory. And on election night, she's hanging out with Breitbart. Again, great details. Breitbart in his office where there's a curtain, so no one can see. 

Bannon. 

Bannon -- excuse me -- where there's a curtain where no one can see what he's doing. But then she tries to get people she wants into the Administration. She's on the executive transition team. 

Right. 

And she tries to get the people she wants in the administration. She gets nixed -- no pun intended -- by and large. And she's sort of -- 

Well she got -- no, I mean, she won some. I mean she wanted Flynn. I mean -- okay -- 

Okay. She got Flynn. That's a big mistake. 

-- for a while. She got Jeff Sessions. She also was dead against Mitt Romney and -- 

And Mitt Romney's daughter. 

Well she was dead against Mitt Romney getting a position. Remember, he was being considered briefly -- 

He was. 

-- for Secretary of State. Yeah, she was furious when Mitt Romney's niece was made head of the RNC. And I think another huge disappointment, she tried twice for John Bolton, who's had a relationship with the Mercers. I mean, he's donated to their causes. They've donated to him. And, you know, John Bolton's foreign policy positions are, I believe, not in line with Donald Trump, so it makes no sense that he would be -- 

But she was upset about it. 

And she's very -- she is very, very, very vocal. But I think the thing that really upset her, and I have this scene in the piece where she goes to Lee Hanley's memorial service on December 19th. What she really wanted -- and this is the sort of, I think, kind of most worrying element of what the Mercers were trying to do, she really wanted to control one outside group, what's called the outside group, this group that -- an advocacy -- that advocates for the issues that gets the President's agenda out across the country. But she didn't just want to do that. Someone in the piece said she wanted to -- she got these people elected. She had got -- 

She believes she got them elected. 

So she now believes -- she wanted this group with her, you know, using Cambridge Analytica as the engine. And this is the most important part, she wanted to hold them accountable. So theoretically, theoretically, let's say Donald Trump, you know, hypothetically wanted to invade Grenada, she -- if she had got her way and her engine with their great database could message the country to follow her agenda and not the President's -- you know, that's power above the level -- 

Is she, like, thinking he's the Manchurian candidate and she's controlling the chip. 

That was the most terrifying part about this. 

I mean, this is terribly revealing about her and her agenda and her desire. 

That was the most terrifying part of this. And the history, if you look at the Mercers' history, shows -- you know, if you go back to the candidates that they backed right at the beginning when they were sort of testing things, the ends matter to them much more than the means. So this, I think, was the most sort of -- this was the most troubling aspect of all of it. She didn't get -- here she got stopped. And she got stopped because Alexander Nix has upset every single American who's come his way. 

In contact with him. 

In contact with him. And Brad Parscale, the very down to earth, Kansas-born, you know -- 

He designed websites for the Trumps and suddenly took over the whole digital strategy. 

He's completely loyal to -- yes, to the Trump family and to Jared Kushner. Really got sick and tired after the election of hearing from the Cambridge Analytica PR machine, how it was all them. When, in fact, he never used any of those psychographics. And the decision for Donald Trump to go to the Rust Belt, to go to Wisconsin, was actually -- it started when Brad Parscale had this light bulb moment. 

Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. 

Yeah. But it was actually a light bulb moment when Parscale suddenly thought, wait a minute, what if we have much lower voter turnout than everyone's been expecting. And he then asked two members of his team to run models based on voter turnout that was similar to the midterms, 2014, not as high as people had been thinking it would be. And that's when he saw the path. He mapped out a path that was actually 305 Electoral College votes, so he was one vote off. And he, then, took all this to Bannon, to Bossie, to Jared Kushner. 

He becomes one of the most important people that most people never even heard of. 

Right. And you know what, and he's like that way. So when he's, then, in a meeting in Trump Tower during the transition team with, you know, Rebekah Mercer and with, you know, all the other -- Kellyanne Conway -- I describe, you know, all the people in the room -- and she's pushing for this one organization, and she's going -- he basically -- 

Pushing for Nix. 

Yes. And he said, you know, very politely, "No." This is not about Mercer. This is about Trump. And no respect -- Cambridge -- and it's certainly not about Cambridge Analytica, who had nothing to do with why we got here. And that caused, you know -- that has caused a rift. We've now ended up with -- I mean, I think Rebekah Mercer will have her own group. But there are now going to be three different outside groups. And it dilutes the power of each, because donors will decide which group to go with. 

I get the sense, from the way you ended the piece, that we haven't heard the last of Rebekah Mercer. 

Oh, no. Oh, no. 

And it sounded also like Steve Bannon knows he's a short timer. He's, like, doing all of these things. I mean, that seemed to me news that you're breaking in this piece. Is that true? 

Well, someone very close to Steve Bannon phoned me this morning to tell me that he has definitely told friends that, you know, he like -- that the country comes first, and he likens himself to Thomas Cromwell, who, as we know, did end up beheaded. 

Head on a silver platter. 

And he's also aware that he's looked tired. But that this person said to me rather humorously, because we often see him on TV wearing makeup. Recently, we saw him at CPAC without wearing any makeup. So he looked much worse. 

So do you think Steve Bannon -- 

I think his priority is this list on the wall he has of all the things -- his agenda for the first hundred days. He cares about that. He cares about the country. If he somehow implodes in the process, that's fine. Country first. 

So we could be -- I mean, he seems to have recognized that his days -- he's only going to have a limited time on the stage. He wants to -- 

Well, listen, who knows what will really be. But we do know that Steve Bannon is a student of history, and people -- 

If you say so. 

Well, people in his position, you know -- 

Have a half-life. 

Yes. 

Have half-life. But the Mercers -- I mean, I think the whole fascinating thing, the Citizens United unleashed the Mercers, it unleashed a lot of powerful wealthy people. But this go-round this election cycle, it seems like it unleashed the Mercers on us, and this is really one of the first times that we're actually able to have an understanding of who they are, how they worked throughout this campaign, first backing Ted Cruz then switching over to Donald Trump. It's really a fascinating rendition of behind the scenes power plays among these very wealthy people, and clearly, Rebekah Mercer loses out, and we haven't heard the end of her. 

Oh, no, not at all. Thank you. 

Thank you. Thank you all for watching.
