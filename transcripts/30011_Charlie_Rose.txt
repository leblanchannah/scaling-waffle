Stay with us. 

HAROLD BLOOM is one of this country's pre-eminent literary critics. He is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University as well as Berg Professor of English at New York University. He has edited and written the introductions of some 400 volumes of literary criticism. He is also author of over 20 books, including such influential works as The Anxiety of Influence and The Western Canon. His new book, Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, examines the works of our greatest English playwright and has already been nominated for a National Book Award. And I am always pleased to have him here, especially this evening. Welcome back, sir. 

Thank you. 

How are you? 

Oh, I'm breathing. 

Come on, now. (pounds table as Bloom slumps in dramatic fashion) 

I'm at 68. 

You have much to look forward to. 

I hope so. 

You do. 

It's very kind of you. We will hope that you are right. 

I am right. You know that. We have to talk about-- I'm gonna-- 

You have always been a fierce optimist. 

I am a fierce optimist. That's exactly right. And you? 

A realistic pessimistic. 

Or a knowledgeable pessimist. 

I don't know about ''knowledgeable.'' Never mind, dear, never mind. 

But are you pessimistic essentially? I mean, you have-- I mean, I'm aware of the struggles of your life. 

Well, one hopes for self-clarification. And sometimes one is afraid it is not really going to come. But-- 

All right. I want you to-- I want you, then, to take a leap from where we just are, where we are now in the conversation about sense of attitude and a sense of perspective or whether it's character to be-- of mine or yours and leap forward to what Shakespeare has taught you about self-examination. 

I think that Shakespeare had the first sense I know of of what he actually called ''the selfsame,'' which is the persistence of identity through all kinds of vicissitudes and changes. And I think that what is most crucial and important about Shakespeare that we have obfuscated that -- both in our universities and on our stages -- in recent years is his intensely vital sense of personality. No author, by far, no author I know of -- Eastern or Western world -- has ever invented so many vibrant and original personalities. 

Give me an example of what you're talking about. 

Falstaff, Hamlet. 

Well, they're your two favorites. 

Yeah. Cleopatra, Iago. 

Yeah. 

King Lear himself. And minor figures like-- apparently minor figures like Barnardine, whom you see so brief in Measure for Measure. The criminal who refuses to be executed, but who is incredibly memorable. Sometimes in just-- think of Shylock. Shylock speaks fewer than -- what is it? -- 350, 360 sentences and lines, and yet the vividness is astonishing. 

Yeah, but for you it's an evil vividness. 

Well, the play-- I do not think that Shakespeare was himself personally anti-Semitic, but the play is a profoundly anti-Semitic play as I-- 

And there are no redeeming values in Shylock? 

In Shylock? No. There are not. 

None? 

There are redeeming values in the play. There are no redeeming values in Shylock. 

In him? 

No. 

In the character? 

No. Shakespeare prevents that. The most outrageous thing about the play, which I have never seen much commentary upon, is that Shakespeare invents the conversion of Shylock, the enforced conversion, which Shylock accepts at the end Act IV, which is no part of the pound of flesh tradition. Shakespeare didn't have to do it. And I wonder, indeed, why he did it because he destroys the dramatic consistency of the character, as I think I have remarked somewhere -- perhaps not in this book. Shylock agreeing to become a Christian even in preference to death is rather like Cleopatra consenting to become a vestal virgin at Rome. It is not persuasive. 

Yes. 

Shakespeare is punishing himself and punishing Shylock but for reasons I don't altogether understand. 

Do you find something new at every reading? 

Oh, yes. 

You do? 

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well, not in all 39 plays. 

Yeah, but-- 

But 24 or 25 of the 38 or 39 plays are so astonishingly original, so endlessly fresh and exuberant that I think you would have to be deaf, stupid, blind, quite dumb not to find something utterly new each time 'round. 

Critics are saying this is a terrific book. You know that. And they don't say-- No, follow the question. 

I'm following the question. 

They don't necessarily believe you have to buy your thesis -- that Shakespeare invented human personality -- to appreciate and enjoy your analysis and your passionate feeling for him. 

Well, that is a perhaps-kind way of putting it on their part. But I still would like to know where our idea personality came from if it did not come from Shakespeare's characters. 

There's no evidence of our ideas of personality before Shakespeare. 

There are ideas of moral character-- 

Yeah? 

--which are very powerful before Shakespeare. There are notions of pathos. Individuals change because their relation to God or the gods change. Individuals indeed sicken, grow old, and die. But they do not change because their relation to their relation to themself changes. They do not change because they overhear themselves and are startled by what they overhear and on that basis undergo extraordinary vicissitudes of mutability. No, that seems to me shockingly original with Shakespeare. I don't even think that my thesis is that original. It comes ultimately out of Dr. Samuel Johnson and William Hazlitt, my heroic precursors. 

Yes, exactly. 

Whom we have largely forgotten because we are inundated-- yes, go on. 

Go ahead. No, I'm not gonna interrupt. I want you to finish I have a question. 

We are inundated with politicized Shakespeare both in the classroom and on our stages. 

What does that mean? ''Politicized''? That those who stage Shakespeare bring their own political-- 

Those who stage Shakespeare and those who teach Shakespeare -- I will be generous about it for once -- I will say that they are attempting to establish the relevance of Shakespeare. But, you know, Charlie, to set out to establish the relevance of Shakespeare is a rather hopeless project. It's rather like saying, ''I'm going to establish the relevance of my own mother and father.'' Whether you think they're relevant or not, your own mother and father are always going to be relevant. And Shakespeare-- 

It's not your choice to make that relevancy 'cause it's-- 

Yeah, Shakespeare is our mother and our father. 

Why do you consider Samuel Johnson and Hazlitt your precursors? 

Well, because-- 

They engaged in literary criticism? 

Because Johnson is the first critic to see and to say very powerfully that what is extraordinary about Shakespeare is, as Johnson calls it, ''the creation of distincts,'' characters who differ absolutely from one another and from every other literary character or representation and characters who speak differently from every other. Hazlitt because Hazlitt sees that what matter in the play most -- in fact, that's what he called his ''splendid book'' -- the characters of Shakespeare's plays. That plot is secondary, that action is secondary, that ideas or politics or religion are not even secondary. That what matters is the exuberant play of fresh personality. 

Shakespeare wrote around the turn from the 16th to 17th century. 

Yes. 

I think the last play was about 1615, wasn't it? Somewhere right in there? 

No, earlier than that. 

1612, maybe? 

About 1612, yes. He dies about 1616, if I remember properly. 

How do you explain Shakespeare? 

Ah, the best possible question to ask. At the beginning of this book, I can say I can't explain him after all these decades of teaching him. I think the proper stance towards him is awe. It is astonishing that it could have happened. You can trace any other writer to some source. You can talk about -- if you will -- societal context. You can talk about history. But Shakespeare transcends any context that you try to find for him. The power of creation in him-- I think I can even focus it. There's an excess in him. There is an overflowing not just of meaning, but of being. There is a sheer newness which comes flowing out of him for which we have no precedent and in a deep sense he has had no successors in spite of the fact that he's been such an immense influence on all who came afterwards. He is-- he is, I suppose, the largest single miracle I know of, not just in the history of the human arts, but in the history of human consciousness. I suppose that, if you are a religious believer, then, you know, you might want to talk about Moses and Jesus and Muhammad. But, as a secular figure, this is as astonish a phenomenon as any of the great religious founders have been. This is, indeed, the secular scripture -- the complete plays of Shakespeare or the complete works of Shakespeare. I think I remarked somewhere in that book in a kind of wonder myself that Hamlet has become the intellectual's Christ. And, even though in the past I have been much condemned for saying that Western worship of God is the worship in the end of three literary characters, you know, the Yahwist or j writers' Yahweh, the Gospel of Mark's original Jesus, and Muhammad's Allah-- I think only Shakespeare competes in his nine or 10 strongest characters with those three great literary characters, which -- of course -- you know, is a-- is a somewhat blasphemous thing to say. But I am a bardolater. At one point in the book -- only half-jokingly, since I am a dinosaur now in academic terms -- I refer to myself as ''Bloom Brontosaurus Bardolater.'' And I think that's a perfectly good description. I see that it's been quoted against me by several reviewers, but it seems to me a perfectly valid self-designation. But, no, I cannot explain Shakespeare. I can appreciate Shakespeare. I can hope to help others to appreciate him more. I can hope to teach others to see that we must not condescend to him, that he is always out ahead of us, that he always knows more than we do, and he has always more than anticipated our latest developments. You can push any of idea you want to into Shakespeare, and it will not necessarily light up the play, but the play will light up the idea. Let us say the power of mind, the power of consciousness, the power of sheer stuff-of-being in him is beyond parallel. And, if it's beyond parallel, then in some sense it's beyond explanation. I think my largest single quarrel, aside from people who politicize Shakespeare or who -- you know -- put on a production of The Tempest in which suddenly both Caliban and Ariel are rebellious black slaves -- you know? -- contending-- It just isn't so. Ariel is an angel and is not rebellious, has a strange love for Prospero even though it is difficult for Ariel. And Caliban is certainly no black slave. He is only half-human. He has a Berber-witch mother and some sort of sea-beast or sea-devil for a father. But I think it's far worse to historicize Shakespeare. Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom I also worship as I worship Hazlitt and Dr. Johnson, chose to begin his first set of essays with an essay called ''History,'' which every professional historian I've know, including the great Vann Woodward, has always denounced to me. It opens with a great sentence. There is no history, only biography. But the problem is now with Shakespeare we haven't really got the biography. We've got a few external facts. I remark somewhere in the book that, ''What do we know about Shakespeare? He seems to have been very lustful towards both men and women. You can tell from the plays that he greatly preferred drinking to eating and that he hated lawyers.'' But you really don't know much else. 

I find extraordinary that the modernity-- 

Oh, that is what I mean by saying it's beyond relevance. 

Exactly. To (crosstalk)-- 

It's beyond. I mean, what we do these days with our so-called post-modernity, which is going to post-millennial, just disappear and be vacuous and out of fashion. He is so far ahead of the post-modern or whatever the post-post-modern will be-- It's like Whitman at the end of Song of Myself saying, ''I stopped somewhere, waiting for you.'' You know? ''Catch up with me if you can.'' Shakespeare even more so always seems to be saying implicitly, ''I stopped somewhere, waiting for you. And it's your business to somehow catch up to me.'' And, you know, this is not a good time, Charlie. No matter what side one is on politically, it's quite awful what has happened, I think, to the teaching of literature in the universities. I mean, stop me on this because I've become permanently furious on this subject, but they don't teach literature any more for the most part. They teach ideology of one sort or another. And most productions that I see of Shakespeare are ideologically over-considered. Ian McKellen is a great actor, but I want to see him play Richard III. I don't want to see him play Sir Oswald Mosly as I did at the Brooklyn Academy of Music where a brilliant director -- was it Mr. Eyre, I think, of the Old Vic? 

Richard Eyre. 

Yeah, it was so concerned, still, to fight the battle against the Lady Astor and the Cliveden set that it was definitely Sir Oswald Mosly. 

Yeah. 

What can one do? High concept directors are, I think, now the curse of Shakespearian production. 

Who's the greatest Shakespearian actor of-- 

Of the 20th century? 

Mm-hmm (affirmative). 

Sir Ralph Richardson, overwhelmingly. That book exists because, when I was 15, I saw here in New York City the Old Vic with Ralph Richardson playing Falstaff in Part 1 of Henry the Fourth in the matinee and then that same evening Falstaff in Part 2 with Olivier play Hotspur in the afternoon and marvelously Justice Shallow in the evening. Richardson is much the finest actor that I have ever seen -- Shakespearian actor. But the British, you know, they're very strange, the English or the British. They don't produce poets any more, though they don't like my saying that. They've got one poet at the moment -- Geoffrey Hill -- and he lives in Boston. They've got one novelist and that's Iris Murdoch, and she's got Alzheimer's. The ones who come after her are not very impressive. They don't really have composers any more. But, my heavens, do they have actors. Every time I look up there are a dozen new Shakespearian actors and actresses who really-- 

I know. 

--can do astonishing things. 

True. 

And-- 

I don't know why that is either. 

I don't understand it. 

I mean, is their tradition so different? 

I think their tradition is much more comprehensive than ours is. And there's much more continuity there. We have some good Shakespearian actors, but we don't have this plethora, this endless stream. 

And are good actors more likely more often to leave the stage? 

Yes, yes. Whereas theirs return to the stage. 

Right. And they-- that umbilical cord is always there. 

It always brings them back. Whereas ours do not necessarily come back. 

Shakespeare could have been writing about not just his time, but any time. 

Oh, I think he took great care to be writing about all time. It's very difficult to know even in the histories whether you really are in the time that he is supposedly talking about. 

In the end, it's more about, though, his true genius is about not plot, but character. 

He was not terribly interested in plots. He didn't like to devise plots. He stole them wherever and whenever he could. You know? With both hands. When he hasn't got-- when he has got a source, as in The Tempest, you've got a plotless play. Nothing happens. 

Yeah. 

No, he was not-- he was not terribly interested in action. He was no Aristotlean. He was immensely fascinated by men and by women. And I think he taught us more-- I mean, that truly is the invention of the human. I mean, where else do you learn that the ultimate difference between men and women is that, on the whole, women are compelled to marry down not because of social convention, not because of social constriction, but simply because -- for the most part -- the best among them are better than the best among us. That's hardly a feminist remark on my part. Feminist critics and I do not get along, which is notorious. But Shakespeare is fiercely perceptive, I think, in the inadequacy of men as compared to women. He somehow understood that it takes-- that a woman could be at 14 or 15 emotionally and spiritually and in terms of generosity fully mature and that it took men 60 or 70 years and then all they were really good for was to die. 

We still don't know-- knowing so little about Shakespeare, we do not know why he was so obsessed and fascinated and wise about inner self. 

No. 

We don't know. We don't know the curiosity. We don't know the-- 

No, we don't know that. 

--intellect. We don't know-- 

We don't know that. There is such a gap between his apparent origins and what he is able to do that I don't think we will ever-- we will ever solve that. There has to have been a great deal of personal suffering there. His one son, Hamlet, died when he was still quite a young boy. And there seems to have been a great deal of erotic suffering. 

Erotic suffering? 

Great deal of erotic suffering. The sonnets-- 

What does that mean? What is ''erotic suffering''? Meaning he was heartbroken? 

I think the sonnets seem to show that he felt profoundly betrayed both by a man and by a woman, both of whom he had loved. And I think that gets into the plays also. 

This book, you go through 35. You begin with these two quotes, one from Nietzsche, the-- 

That one-- the one from Nietzsche fascinates me. I've been much-condemned for it because it's my own translation. But I think I've got the right. And I got it from one of my mentors, the late, great, great Kenneth Burke who always loved to quote that to me and said, ''Harold, I hand it to you. Use it.'' And I have used it. ''That for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts. There's always a kind of contempt in the act of speaking.'' That's pure Hamlet. And its profoundly unsettling. It means that, if somebody says that they love you, you can't believe them because they're saying something which is already dead in their hearts. And I juxtaposed it with the astonishing lines at the end of the play, A King's Speech, which is undoubtedly written by Hamlet himself, when he converts the murder of Gonzago into the mousetrap. ''But orderly to end where I've begun / Our wills and fates do so contrary run / That I our devices all are overthrown / Our thoughts are ours, the ends none of our own.'' 

Ends none. 

I guess it's a kind of despairing juxtaposition, but I think Shakespeare did despair. I think-- I think the burden of his work, if you follow it, shows him moving into a time of great rancidity of spirit in Troilus and Cressida and Measure for Measure and ending in The Two Noble Kinsmen and the parts of the play that he wrote with a real revulsion from human sexuality. And I think-- I think that transcends dramatic representation. I think-- I think there is a (unintelligible). 

This book goes from the early comedies -- The Comedy of Errors, Taming of the Shrew, Two Gentlemen of Verona -- through the first histories -- Henry VI, King John, Richard III -- the apprentice tragedies -- including Julius Caesar -- the high comedies -- including A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing -- the major histories -- Richard II, Henry IV, Merry Wives of Windsor -- to the problem plays -- All's Well that Ends Well -- the great tragedies -- Hamlet, Othello, Lear, Macbeth, Anthony and Cleopatra -- through the tragic epilogue, the late romances, then the-- 

(crosstalk) calling them romances. That was Edward Dardens (sp), an Irish critic, friend of the Yeats family in the late Victorian period. They're not romances. They're tragi-comedies of a very peculiar kind, but to call them ''romances'' is to make them more supernatural than they really are. 

Do you feel that this is the book that you had to write? And this is somehow your-- 

It makes me sad. I will not write anything like this again. I mean, quite aside from the fact that an old fellow-- 

68. 

I'm 68. 

Let's not get carried away with age. 

Well, I know. I know. I know. But you are perpetually young. You are the fountain of youth. I am not. No, I was long time writing this. I wrote other things in between. I'm writing a book now called How to Read and Why, which will be a short book and -- I hope -- a pungent and useful one. This-- this-- this tries to be useful, you know. This is not addressed to academics. God knows, I don't want one of them to read. I see a couple of them have reviewed it. I wish they hadn't. It is for what Johnson and Virginia Woolf called ''common readers'' and common playgoers. It aspires to be helpful. I mean, aside from what the argument of it is or is not, and you don't even have to read it, you know, in toto. I have allowed some incremental repetitions because I want people to be able to read a chapter before they go see a particular play or read a particular play and then read a chapter and see if it's somewhat helpful, as I hope it is. But it makes me sad now that it's over. Yes. Because I think it's my book. I not only won't do better, but I think the book is better than I am, which makes me sad, partly because it's Dr. Johnson and Hazlitt from whom I have borrowed so liberally. 

Thank you for coming. 

Bless you. Thank you for having me, Charlie. 

Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, 

Thank you, Charlie.
