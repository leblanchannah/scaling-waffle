Good evening, I'm Jeff Greenfield filling in for Charlie Rose. Donald Trump was not exactly the consensus choice of the Republican Party. Roughly one in five GOP senators refused to endorse him. So did four of the last five republican presidential nominees. But with his election, and with the party controlling both houses of congress, republicans of almost all stripes saw a chance to finally enact some of their most significant goals, some tax cuts to the environment, to regulation. Now the first big test, repealing and replacing Obama Care, has hit something of a wall of opposition within republican ranks, the House Freedom Caucus and others on the right say this is Obama Care light. Republican governors and some senators say the plan's changes in Medicaid would leave millions of the least well off without protection, and now some of the Trump's most ardent supporters, Breitbart, Laura Ingraham, appear to be urging Trump to break with House Speaker Paul Ryan and forge his own path. So how big a threat is the health care fight to the long-term hopes of the Party and the President. Joining me now, two journalists on the right, Bret Stephens, foreign affairs columnist and deputy editorial page editor at the Wall Street Journal, and Reihan Salam, he is executive editor of National View. I'm pleased to welcome you both to table. Let me start with you, Reihan. This can't be what the White House and the republican leadership had hoped to find when they put the health care bill out. 

Well the truth is that this isn't really President Trump's health care proposal. This is a proposal that's been knocking around, that's been evolving over a long period of time in the mind of House Speaker Paul Ryan, and it reflects Paul Ryan's priorities, and the Trump administration is beside it to put its muscle behind this legislative proposal. It's not obvious that that's a very sensible thing of the Trump Administration to be doing. And the fundamental problem for Ryan and his allies is that the goals that republicans have articulated on health care are really pretty contradictory and irreconcilable. They both have to solve a political problem of not completely unraveling this new health care system that's been created in this country over the past few years. On the other hand, they want to deliver smaller government to their most ardent ideological supporters. And that's a very tough circle to square. And the Trump administration, the truth is that I don't think the President himself has thought all that deeply about all these questions. What he did do, how he differentiated himself when he ran for the Republican nomination was by presenting himself as a defender of the safety net. And lo and behold, he found that many republican primary voter responded rather strongly to that message, and that's going to be a big problem for him. 

So you have this -- I don't know if it's a paradox, but you have the kind of odd situation where the people who most want an unalloyed repeal, people like in the House Freedom Caucus, they seem to be the ones who are most urging Trump to break with Speaker Ryan, even though Trump's instincts seem to be toward, as you say, preserving the safety net, far from a kind of repeal-free market system. 

That's right. The opposition within the Republican Party to this plan comes from two seemingly very different directions. It comes from people who are styling themselves as ideological purists, yet who also, funnily enough, in many cases represent rural constituencies and other constituencies with older voters who benefit from the Obama Care status quo. It also comes from republican senators in particular who represent more diverse swing constituencies, who represent, in some cases, states that have accepted the Obama Care Medicaid expansion. So you both have opposition from what you might describe as the left of the party, and also from the right of the party, and yet, in a lot of ways, the kind of base for both of those different kinds of republicans are actually quite similar. 

So, but, look, this is the problem. You have a congress that, whether on one side or the other among the republicans is in the process of making what amounts to ideological calculations. Does the Ryan bill go far enough or not? I think the President is making a political calculation, which is, does he want this Republican Party on his arm or not? To him, the congressional republicans are like a girlfriend who might or might not be interesting to him. Maybe that's too colorful. 

Not for PBS. It's fine. It's a late-night show. 

But, so in other words, for Trump, he used the republicans, and this iteration of the Republican Party, as basically disposable. And that's what I don't think the republicans in congress, or, really, the republican base that got behind Donald Trump ever really understood. He would be somewhat -- he reminds me, actually, in his own way ironically, in his own way of Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is he will be as comfortable governing as a conservative, quote, or somewhat conservative republican as he would be as a populist democrat, and that's what I think republicans don't understand. 

Just one thing. You said something that resonates, Bret, when you talked about he's treating republicans as disposable. I think there's another way of looking at it, which is that for a lot of republican primary voters, they feel as though traditional republicans were treating them as disposable and that Donald Trump came along and actually spoke to them, spoke up for their interests, and pledged to defend them. And I think that that is a big problem, because Paul Ryan has an imperative that an intra-republican imperative. How does he satisfy the different ideological constituencies, the think tanks, the donors, what have you, and satisfy their zeal for smaller government; whereas Trump was speaking to this republican electorate 

And to that point, Stan Greenberg, who is a democratic poster, just did a focus group with 35 Trump voters. All of them are staying with him. But they are very angry with the republican congress. You know, they thought that Trump had gotten their votes, in part, because he was not one of them. And so the question is when you move from that kind of political arena to the legislative process, how does Trump satisfy his voters who heard a populace message and get anything through congress? 

Look, the thing is, if we find out in the next week or so that this bill is not going to make its way through congress, that it doesn't lack the support, Trump is simply going to turn on the republicans, on Ryan, and you already see rumblings of this through his media operations, or associated media operations, to say this was the point I was making at the get-go. You can't trust these republicans, because Trump, of course, was never an actual republican, never part of the party ideologically, barely a part of the party in terms of his formal party affiliation. 

You're suggesting a public and open declaration. 

I don't think it would necessarily hurt Trump with his movement, because the Republican Party was always -- now, to switch metaphors -- essentially the horse he was riding on his way to the Presidency, was a vehicle of convenience. Once your horse is exhausted and collapses under you, you get on another horse. And the Trump base that relates to his anger, his nativism, the emotional appeal that he projects to a certain type of voter is not going to abandon him so easily. The people who are going to find themselves disappointed are those movement conservatives who made what essentially amounted to a bargain with the devil, thinking Trump is a guy we can control, we can inform. He is the jar into which we will pour the sweet wine of Paul Ryan's agenda. It didn't quite work out that way. 

Jeff, if I may. 

Yes. 

If you think back to George W. Bush, we've all forgotten him now, but think become to George W. Bush reelected in 2004, reelected, in large part, because in the State of Ohio, he managed to win the votes of large numbers of lower middle income folks, many of them women. He did surprisingly well with African American voters in that state. He won them over because George W. Bush, to them, seemed like someone who was going to defend America's interests. He was going to look out for people like them, working and middle class voters in in these states. And then shortly after he was inaugurated, what did he press forward with? 

Social security reform. 

Social security reform. At a time, by the way, when benefit pensions were going away, when a lot of people are awfully anxious about wage stagnation, much else, and also a vast guest worker program, and not to mention that he was going to spread democracy around the world. So that was his program, despite having won on the strength, again, of these working and middle income voters. So for Donald Trump right now to abandon Ryan Care, which, again, is a set of ideas that pretty much every conservative walk is quickly abandoning because of its apparent unsustainability. If for Trump to abandon this now would, in my view, be a very astute reading of actual flesh and blood republican voters. 

But then you have this other little -- I don't know if it's an 800-pound gorilla or an 800-pound elephant but it's something, which is, I hear it on conservative talk radio. We've heard it from the press secretary that, look, it's a binary choice. If you want to repeal Obama Care, this is all you have. And, frankly, it sort of reminds me of a story. A guy's in a bullfight, sees a vendor with a sign, hot meat pies, ten pesos. He gives him the money, he bites into it. It's cold, it's doughy, and there's no meat. And when he complains, the vendor say, no, no, hot meat pie, that's the name of the pie. And so the question is, are we at a point where the republicans are so desperate to say we repealed Obama care that they're going to argue don't even worry about what's in it. If we don't repeal Obama Care, we're going to disappoint all the people who have been waiting eight years for this. 

No. I think, look, that that's a perfectly fair point; that if they don't get this bill through, then this republican congress is a failure. You are just as -- you are setting up a democratic majority or super majority in 2018, just as surely as the failure of Hillary Care back in 1993 set up the republicans for the Newt Gingrich ascendancy a year later. And I think that may be the kind of thought that at the bottom is going to win over both Freedom Caucus types and, you know, wavering moderates to say, well we have to get behind this or else there won't be a Republican Party. There's not going to be a tax-cutting agenda or any other part of the republican -- the platform that they want to enact. This presidency will be dead on -- or I should say this congress will be dead on arrival. 

To me, it reflects a kind of bizarre fantasy about republicans and what republicans actually want. And the RAND Corporation conducted a study of republican primary voters. And they found something that I think is going to shock you, Jeff. They found that 51 percent of republican primary voters favor increasing taxes on people who earn more than $200,000 a year. Now if you look at the larger universe of republican voters, that number would be comparable, or perhaps even higher, because, again, primary voters tend to be a little more affluent than the public at large. 

So let me just ask you something, why in the health care bill are the tax credits skewed so dramatically toward the more affluent. 

Thank you very much, Jeff. Well done. So you got right onto this. So in this legislation if you had a bit more revenue -- the hard thing in Obama Care was to actually get this revenue; right? And, again, you might want to have tax cuts down the line. You might want to have bigger middle class tax cuts. That's something that many republicans would enthusiastically support. But where was the grassroots furor for cutting taxes for people earning millions and millions of dollars; right? I mean, if you're looking at cuts in taxes on income investments and what have you, but that is really the chief accomplishment of Ryan Care, relative to all of the other disruption harm that it may well cause. And that sends a really bad signal. So it's one thing for republicans to pledge we're going to have a tax reform that's going to grow the economy. We've going to focus on, let's say, corporate taxes. We're going to do something that's going to make America a more attractive destination for investments and what have you. That makes a lot of sense. That would have been a great first thing to do. But instead you have Ryan acting as though there's some kind of time limit on Obama Care. This is not the debt limit. This is not something that's going to blow up in your face if we don't do this right now. And getting the sequence right matters a lot in politics. Had Bill Clinton passed welfare reform before he moved on to health reform, it's quite possible that you wouldn't have had the Republican Revolution of 1994. If George W. Bush tried doing something about the woes of middle class folks troubled by their vulnerable health insurance before passing a big tax cut, the politics of the Bush years would have been very different too. Trump has an opportunity to get this right by cutting Ryan loose. 

And, look, part of the problem here is that the republicans are fantasizing that they have an opportunity comparable to the one that Obama had in 2009. The difference is eight seats in the Senate, and that's a significant difference, in that Obama had just -- and just, if you remember the Obama Care debate, just enough political capital in those two years from '09 to '10 to just push through something as big as Obama Care. The real lesson -- I think Reihan is exactly right. The presidencies that succeed do it by taking small steps and winning every time, rather than trying to reverse something as large as this as your first order of business. 

So let me put this on the table for both of you. I'll start with you, Bret. So let's say that President Trump comes to the realization that, you know what, I won with a message that was essentially populist. You know, half of my inaugural speech could have been given by Bernie Sanders, so I've been misled by the republican leadership, I'm going to refashion, or I'm going to have my people refashion the health care that's alive with what I'm going to do with taxes that really is devoted to the middle class. And as I said in the campaign, I'm not really interested in helping those who already have so much. Is that a plausible political road for him to take? 

Yes, it is, because I've always thought -- and this is one of the reasons I'm a "Never Trumper," is that, actually, Donald Trump ideologically would be more comfortable in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party; that his emphasis on social protection, his belief in infrastructure spending, all of these align, at least with the classic democratic economic agenda. He defined -- about a year ago, before the election, he was asked what the future of the Republican Party would be in five or ten years' time. And he actually gave, to my surprise, a really coherent answer. He said, "I see the Republican Party as a worker's party." All right. Not a party of plutocrats, entrepreneurs, capitalists, and so on, but as a party of, well, the base that famously elected him. They want protection, whether it's protection from competition from immigrants or illegal immigration. They want protection from what they see as a Muslim horde that is invading the country, and these kind of fantasies. They want social protection. They want economic protection. They want a kind of corporatist state of a kind that we have examples of from, say, frankly, Juan Peron's Argentina. This is very different from the Republican Party that I understood, that I came of age with under Ronald Reagan. 

And, if I may, just to set up, or maybe I won't set up. I'll try. It always seemed to me that Donald Trump was a third-party candidate who figured that the only way a third-party candidate could actually win the White House was to take one of the two parties, and both parties are so hollowed out in terms of institutional forces that could prevent that, that he did it. In that case, if Donald Trump tried to redefine the Republican Party along populist lines, how does that work, given who the leadership is in the House and the Senate? Mitch McConnell is populist. Paul Ryan is populist, in the sense of changing the tax list. That seems to me a pretty hard road. 

Well, when you're thinking about the two parties, one way to think about them is purely through an ideological lens. And another way to think about them is, well, what is the coalition the party is representing. And one way to think about it is over the last 20-or-so years, the Democratic Party has evolved into what you might call a barbell party. It's a party that represents large numbers of working class people, particularly working class people of color. And it also represents a larger number of college educated upper middle income folks, and some very rich people as well. If you look at the 2012 election for example, Barack Obama outperformed Mitt Romney among voters in households earning more than $200,000 a year. That was the first time a democrat had pulled off that feat since 1964. That is a pattern that's likely to keep persisting. So then the Republican Party is represents the broad American middle. Right now it's largely the white middle, but it represents parts of the country that are more egalitarian, that are less cosmopolitan, and also parts of the country that have been hard hit by global economic integration in various ways. So, to me, that is a place that -- you know, that should prompt republican politicians to think about how do I better represent the interest of this constituency. Of course there are ideological imperatives, but I think that's a good starting point. And I think that Donald Trump's politics, as imperfect as they are, were a good starting point for thinking about how do we actually take these parts of the country that have been left out of rising prosperity and deliver this message. We want to make sure that everyone in the country is progressing with global economic integration, with automation, with rapid. And the Republican Party can be the party that ensures that everyone making that transition. Right now it's not. 

Bret, you've describe yourself as a "Never Trumper, and your columns reflect that. Is there anything -- but let me ask you not about him right away but about the broader Republican Party. Is there anything in the Republican Party leadership, in their agenda, that fits what Reihan was just talking about, in terms of where they want the tax cuts to go, how they want to protect workers? Is there anything substantive that you can point to that says, yeah? 

Look, you know, the Republican Party at its best is a party that represents aspiration, opportunity, and inclusion. It's a party that says we can find -- we are going to get government out of the way so that you can pull yourself up without being burdened by regulations. So something like, you know, for instance, the push for greater choice, greater opportunity for disadvantaged minorities is a perfect example of that kind of party. In fact, the classic Ryan sort of, if you want to call it that, the Ryan wing of the Republican Party, I don't think is antithetical to that. Although it doesn't do a fantastic job of presenting itself in those colors. In fact, I think what is antithetical to that is the kind of nativism, close your doors, you know, batten down the hatches republicanism represented by Donald Trump. But you're absolutely right in that this wing of the Party has not done a particularly good job of selling that vision of republicanism, in part, I would argue, because it so wholly has given itself over to Trumpism, to working with Donald Trump, rather than trying to make clear what the differences are between old-fashioned Reagan-style republicanism, and the nativism represented by Trump. 

Two quick responses to that. The first is that when we talk about government getting out of the way, this is something that republicans often talk about, and I'm often sympathetic to it. The problem is that when you think about school choice, when you think about changing the health care system, you actually need to know how these institutions work. And when you take this reflexive antigovernment view, you know, as attractive as it might be ideologically, that means that you're often times bereft of the know-how that's required to actually make these things happen. And that's been a big problem for the Republican Party, number one. Number two, Bret has referred, on a number of occasions, to nativism. And I just want to be very clear that there's a big difference between, let's say, contempt for immigrants, just a random distaste for them, as though they're somehow worse people, and also a belief that the United States, like all other countries, is a country that needs to be thoughtful about our immigration policies and that wants to be sure that our immigration policies serve our national interest over the long term, and the interest of vulnerable American, including the children of immigrants who are oftentimes quite poor. And I think that our policies to date, you know, and also policies among many pro-immigration republicans by the way, take the view that, let's let in large number of impoverished people and then let's deny them access to Medicaid and SNAP and the Earned Income Tax Credit, and a number of panoply of other programs. That doesn't seem like a very sensible idea, and I'd say that Trump is someone who came out and said, yeah, that doesn't make a lot of sense, and low and behold, most republican primary voters agreed with him. 

Look, the immigration views that are really represented in the Trump Administration are those of the Iowa congressman, Mr. King. Well other people's babies, that was, I think -- I have to give him credit, he perfectly captured, in his way, exactly what this wing of the Republican Party -- 

Right of course you want to reduce -- 

Nobody on earth says we should have no kind of -- we should a completely irrational or open border system. We should be -- 

There are a lot of people who say we should have an open-border system, Bret. 

They're -- okay, on extreme libertarian right, perhaps you can find that. Everyone understands that you need a regulated immigration system. That's a strong -- 

Yeah, but what's the principle? What is the basis of regulation? Should the basis be a national interest oriented policy or should it be what's in the interest of employers? 

What is a national interest? I don't know about -- I mean, look, my mother arrived in this country with $7 to her name. She was a refugee; all right? And then in the space of one generation, her son is routinely accused of being elitist, one of the great chime of American democracy I would say. 

You're absolutely right. It's also the case that when you're looking at folks from Appalachia, and you're looking at folks from the Mississippi Delta, these are folks that we neglect. Why do we neglect them? Because we can, Bret. It's because we can, because we've decided to replace one workforce with another. And that's not to say that immigration isn't a wonderful thing that enriches our country, but it also means that having a more thoughtful policy is not crazy. Having a policy that emphasizes skills, having a policy that designed to enrich the country is not somehow -- 

You're playing into -- look, you know perfectly well that what threatens workers in the proverbial Appalachia is not the Mexican or Honduran immigrant. 

No, it's not that. 

It's automation. 

At this time, I think I need to put the subject a little bit back to where we started. Although, this is clearly one of the arguments that is going to be at the heart and soul of the republicans. But I wanted to ask perhaps a less lofty question, which is this. Clearly, a lot of republicans made their peace with Donald Trump despite some significant questions about temperament and character, because they thought, A, it's a binary choice, we either get him or we lose the Supreme Court for a generation. My question is, to what extent -- if there is legislative grid lock, if the Obama Care repeal crashes and burns, if there are increasing tensions between 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the other end in congress, to what extent will the patience of some republicans with Donald Trump's more erratic behavior begin to wither? In other words, do you expect that there will be people who are willing to say, say, no, don't take this seriously or literally because he's our guy? To what extent do you think he risks a certain erosion within his own party if he can't legislatively do what the congressional wing is hoping he'll do? 

Look, I can't really speak to that. I mean, my sense is that if Trump were to prevent republicans from doing something politically disastrous, they may well be beholding to him. But I will say something else, congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government. It is the job of congress, regardless of the party in charge, to do its job of holding the executive branch accountable. So you may well be right that there's some political calculation going on here. But my view is, if there are serious questions, and I think there are about the Trump Administration, about its ties to foreign governments and what have you, those should be investigated by congress. 

What I found stunning is the resilience of Trump's supporters. I wrote about this just the other week. I mean, so far seven weeks of the Trump Administration, just think how much political capital, how many political opportunities have been squandered in one self-inflicted wound after another, one stupid tweet after another that simply seems to consume all administration -- all the Administration's energy. And you would think, or I would think that this would make thoughtful Trump supporters say this isn't quite what I signed up for. I signed up for a guy who knew how to drive a bulldozer and was going to drive it right through congress to accomplish a task. But, you know, you mentioned the polling data out of Michigan. That doesn't seem to be happening, in part because, look, Trump is a cult of personality figure. To understand the Trump phenomenon, I think we have to look at political phenomena that go beyond the regular American democratic experience, which is why mention someone line like Juan Peron in Argentina. Why is it that he has this emotional pull on his core supporters that can't be explained by results? 

That's where I think a lot of us miss the point, going back a year-and-a-half. And it's one of the things I think I got right from the very beginning. Everything we thought and had been taught was a bug was a feature. The very vulgarity proved that he was not a prisoner of the kind of establishment. The very fact that he was wanted to break the china, the fact that he boasted of his money was a way of saying he's too rich to steal and he can't be bought. And I think the resiliency he has now you can trace all the way back to when a lot of us thought he'll never make it through the first insult of John McCain. 

Well it's funny, because Donald Trump has a stronger attachment to a republican base, and a republican base that is very skeptical of republicans who don't seem to have their interest in mind. So the truth is that Trump never would have happened if you had a Republican Party that was more responsive to the party. You know, something like seven or eight percent of republicans want to increase immigration levels. Who were the main heavyweight republicans Presidential candidates? They were Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, among others, who favored increasing immigration levels. This is shear madness. If that hadn't been the case, there's no way that Trump would have gotten this far. And he understands that. Now my view is that because Trump takes the kind of minority view within the Republican Party, he actually needs to be much more disciplined. He needs to have an agenda with which he can impress upon the Republican Party, and the problem is that he doesn't. He doesn't have that discipline that he needs, and that's a huge problem. 

I think it's a mistake to think of Trump as an agenda phenomenon, like, you know, like he was speaking about immigration or trade. He could completely flip his views on any number of these subjects over the next year or so, and I don't think that would necessarily alter his basis attachment to -- you know, the guy wrote me. I get literally thousands of letters from my columns so they become almost a representative sample of a lot of Trump support. I thought the best letter I ever got was a guy who said, "You don't get it. We know he's vulgar. We know he's crass. We know he doesn't have a command of policy issues, but at last we has a President," and since I'm on public television, it's a word that rhymes with a Spanish word "cajones," which is a Spanish word which means drawers. I'm thinking of a different word, but people know what I'm talking about. That's what they got, which was here was a politician who was not pusillanimous, who never backed down, who never apologized. The appeal went well beyond what Trump was saying about immigration or any number of other subjects. It was the sense that here was a guy who, at last, didn't care what guys like me or guys like you think about him. 

The mainstream republican. 

But the question, if I may, can that sustain, for instance, legislative defeats in which his core supporters say, well you promised you'd deliver us something, or is this bond with Trump so strong that they will simply accept his version of reality, you know, the I was betrayed or the republicans were too weak. In other words, how resilient is the resilience that Bret described? 

Well, it really depends on his opposition; right? If his opposition proves effective, if you have democrats who, let's say, acknowledge that we ought to have an immigration policy that is based in legality and that it's oriented toward the national interest, Trump will be in big trouble. If his opposition enables him by trying to marginalize some of these common sense views, then he may well get away from it. But, I mean, the fundamental issue is, the reason I emphasize the agenda part -- and you're right, I mean Trump is not someone who is a programmatic policy thinker. But if you had another candidate who is more a disciplined, restrained person who is running on a national interest agenda, who is running, saying much as Reagan did, that, yes, we favor free trade, but we are certainly going to punish those who violate the rules. You know, if you have someone along those lines, that candidate would have won this election in a landslide. Had you run the 2016 Presidential election ten times, nine times out of ten, Donald Trump would have lost. That was an election won by the skin of his teeth. And, again, if you had another republican who was aligned with the base who was more measured, who was more, dare I say, centrist on some issues pertaining to the safety net, that candidate would have won overwhelmingly. 

So what is that? 

Well, I mean, that's a counterfactual. We're never going to know. But I come back to this theme. I think it's very important. I think you, Reihan, are thinking about Trump in terms of American -- an ordinary -- as another American politician in an American political tradition, and he simply isn't that. He's out of -- he landed, as it were, or a comet, so to speak. He is, I think, the most -- if you want to think of him in a global way, he is the most representative example of a wave of illiberalism, which has been sweeping the globe, and you can see it in the Philippines with Rodrigo Duterte. You can see it in France with Marine Le Pen. You can see it with the Pegida Movement, and so on. It's sort of neither left -- the ordinary political distinctions of liberal and conservative, I think, have washed away. The real distinctions are more between liberal and illiberal. He represents a form of political illiberalism married to a cult of personality, and that's his strength. And I don't think you're going to end up finding a new Republican Party by sort of adjusting or erasing traditional republican beliefs in the virtues of free markets and -- 

Here's the problem. Here's the problem, Bret. You literally have a lot of conservative outlets who claim that the basic center right Christian democratic consensus that you have in many other countries is socialistic. You have them claiming that it's crazed lunacy and that's why you couldn't have a center right Republican Party that recognizes that people depend on the safety net. By marginalizing and stigmatizing all those who said, "Hey, you know, maybe we need child tax credits for parents, for middle income parents, to help raise their kids." By saying that that is socialism you open the way to someone like Donald Trump. The idea that this is somehow illiberalism that's driving this, to me, seems silly. To me, it's a failure on the part of mainstream republicans. 

You know what, I think it would be fine if Charlie, at the end of this legislative session, has you both back and you can weigh. We'll play these comments and we'll see whether or not the next three to six months bear it out. But I will just say this is one thing I think is kind of universal, this is a presidency unlike anything we have ever seen or maybe even could have imagined. Reihan, Bret, thank you very much. 

Thank you.
