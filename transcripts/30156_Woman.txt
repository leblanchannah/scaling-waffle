"Cries from Syria" is the new documentary from Oscar-nominated director Evgeny Afineevsky. It recounts the horror of the Syrian war, featuring interviews with journalists, activists, and children who have experienced the brutality firsthand. Here is a look at the trailer. (MUSIC) 

Syria is a very ancient and beautiful country. It is called the cradle of civilization. But we have been living under a dictatorship for 40 years. But we were so optimistic that the revolution will, sooner or later, start in Syria. (MUSIC) They wrote, "It's your turn, doctor," because Bashar al-Assad was trained as a doctor. 

Anyone who talk about him, he will just disappear or he will die. (GUNFIRE) 

It was horrible, it started the revolution all over Syria. More than half a million people joined demonstrations. (MUSIC) 

Our job is to save their life through destroying the terrorists. (EXPLOSION) 

We demonstrated holding roses and he called us terrorists. 

This regime, they are supposed to protect us, but they are not protecting us. They are shooting us. 

And when the Russians got involved, things are getting worse every day. (EXPLOSION) We Syrians are the people who are suffering the most from ISIS. (MUSIC) 

There is a group of people who give us hope, a group who are trying to save lives. (MUSIC) 

We are not terrorists. We are people like everyone in this world. And we still have dreams. (MUSIC) 

The HBO documentary film "Cries from Syria" will debut March 13 on HBO. I am pleased to have the film's director, Evgeny Afineevsky, and journalist, Kholoud Helmi, at this table for the first time. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

Evgeny, Syria is unconscionable abomination, it is a stain on all humanity. But this war has now been going on for almost six years. Half a million dead, five million refugees, other millions displaced. A lot of people's eyes just glaze over at this point. You say Syria and they throw up their hands. So why did you make this movie? Why did you decide that this was a film you had to make? 

I think a lot of people still have lack of knowledge about Syria, the beginning of the revolution, about what brought to such a huge crisis, refugee crisis, that we haven't experienced since second world war. So I think following the European crisis in 2015 after finishing "Winter on Fire," I found that the answer's not there. The answer that fueled these people, because of some misconception through the media, because media started to cover these events through the major, major waves of refugees in 2015, when a lot of immigrants from different, again, immigrants, refugees from different parts of the world and, again, I am emphasizing, the European Union doesn't have all Syrian refugees, it's only around 27 to 30 percent are Syrian refugees among all the people who are trying to reach the European Union. 

How do you go about making the movie? Did you go yourself to Syria? How did you meet Kholoud? How did you do it? It is very tough for journalists to get into Syria. There are direct threats from ISIS. It is a very, very tough environment and yet you produce extraordinary footage in this movie. 

First of all, I think thanks to the journalists and the activists who have been documenting every step of the revolution, because from the beginning, for them the camera became something that it was their weapon, to witness the atrocities, and to commend the atrocities. And I think thanks to them and to today's technology, it was able to make it happen. 

Kholoud, what did it mean to you now today, living in Turkey, to have this opportunity in this movie to express your experiences? You are often in tears in the movie. I mean, this is something absolutely heart-wrenching. This is the loss of your country, the loss of your town, the loss of everything, and you have to sit and watch Bashar al-Assad saying, oh, they were all terrorists. There was no genuine uprising. These are very painful things. So what did it mean for you to be able to speak in this way to Evgeny's camera? 

First, it was so difficult to remember these days. Living these events for six years, it took everything from us, starting from my home, my family members, my friends, and all the dreams. So to go remember all of these events and we kept like -- we try to keep our psychology like kind of a little bit -- like we are all traumatized, but we are bracing up to face things and continue. But it was so difficult to remember things from the past because I think that these were nightmares and -- 

But remembering is so important. 

Remembering is so important, thanks to Evgeny for this step, because it is so difficult for us. These things that we lived, now I am pushing them to the back of my memories. I don't want to remember them, but when I have to speak about them, they all come out. And after five years, there is someone who came to put the story all together from the beginning to the end. 

What is it like for you when you watch President Assad in his palace essentially dismissing everything that has happened in your country over the last six years and explaining that you, anybody who thought like you, who wanted freedom, who wanted a more open society, who wanted an end to the decades of brutal, brutal rule, the massacre of Hama happened decades ago and the same family is still there. And he is calling you and people who think like you terrorists. What is it like for you in the movie to watch that? 

First of all, sometimes it happens like it is funny. It is so sarcastic to listen to him saying this. But unfortunately, I hate no one in this world but Bashar Al-Assad. 

But you do hate him? 

I hate no one but him. And the hatred in my heart goes to the extent that -- I don't know what to say, but I mean, to see him safe and sound in the palace, just reciting and lecturing people that this is what happened. And this makes me feel so depressed because of the whole international community. 

Some people think he could be part of the solution. President Putin thinks he could be part of the solution. What do you say to that? Could Syria -- 

He is the problem. 

He is the problem? 

He is the problem. How could -- 

More than ISIS? 

Yes, for me, more than ISIS. Like my first enemy -- 

Why? 

Because ISIS was actually created by Assad and it is supported by him. I mean, if things would be like being a Syrian and the Syrian, I mean, living those events for six years, Assad was tracing us activists to silence us. And then the free Syrian armies started to liberate some parts of Syria, almost, 90 percent of Syria was free. This is 2000, end of 2012, 2013. All of a sudden, we started to have ISIS. And now, those people who fled Damascus, the capital, or any capital where the regime exists, they fled to oposition-held areas and now they are killed by ISIS. So activists who were lucky to flee Assad were killed and chased by ISIS. And ISIS is taking land over from the free Syrian army, handing it over to the regime and then the regime taking it over, back and forth like what happened in Palmyra. It is a game. It is very obvious that this is a filthy game and -- 

A filthy game? 

Yes. Between Assad and all its partners, including ISIS, to destroy us or to silence us and this happened -- like now we are losing not only power, we are losing ourselves. 

Lost Aleppo. 

We lost Aleppo. 

Evgeny, you have some amazing footage involving children. I found some of the most powerful images in the movie involved children. Perhaps we could roll a segment about a child describing the war in Syria and then we can talk about that. (MUSIC) Evgeny, why do you focus on children so much? 

You know what, I think, despite if you hate regime, like regime, nobody allowed the regime to torture kids and since the beginning of the revolution, we witnessed that it is actually the kids that have been tortured and then been killed. And I think using these images and allowing to these kids being vocal in the movie, allowing them who instead of having a child and calling them lost generation of Syrian kids who still have tons of hope, who are doing such activities that a grownup's doing, for example in the movie, you can see how optimistic they are helping and creating -- 

I remember the kids who say President Assad turned off the electricity so now we have to bring the water up by ourselves and then they put together a pulley system to carry the water to the top floor of the building. And these are kids that are like eight or nine. So you watch that and you think for a moment maybe perhaps that is a source of hope. 

It is. And you know what, they are very optimistic, they have a hope, and one of the reasons why I used the -- rolled known clips of the kids like Elan, three year old, that all rolled, witnessed this footage in September of 2015, the shot you see in the movie, Elan was fleeing the country with his family and found dead on the shores of Turkey, three year old. Elan symbolizes for me the death of the young kids in Syria. And then images in August of 2016, Amaran, in an ambulance, this symbolizes struggle and survival. And then al-Habib from December last year, symbolizing, for me, hope. so I think through these kids, through their stories, through the kids that I interviewed and I interviewed a lot of kids, all together interviewed over 100 people in my movie. So through these kids, for the first time, I am putting all of them in the context of the story through their faces, through their stories, I am trying to tell about uprising, about civil war, about all the interventions, about hope that these kids still have because they believe that one day they will be able to go back to Syria and rebuild the country. So for me it is important to deliver these voices and to keep my camera on the level of their eyes. I think they are witnesses, they are the heroes, they are also struggling with that, but they are also my heroes at the end of the day. 

Kholoud, there is a cycle, you know, this boy's found head down on the beach and all the world erupts and says we cannot tolerate this any longer. This is terrible, unacceptable. And then the weeks go by and people ignore Syria again. It must be quite desperate for you watching this. 

It is. Actually, I lost hope in governments, like I believed that governments are not going to do anything for Syria, and they are adding -- 

Are you very disappointed in the United States? 

Yes, I am. 

Do you think President Obama should have upheld the red line as he said he would when the regime used chemical weapons? 

There is no red line. Unfortunately, every single -- 

There are no red lines, but he said there was. 

But they crossed -- I mean, everyone, every president claimed that things are a red line. Like President Obama said that chemical weapons are a red line, but Assad crossed them and -- 

With no consequence. 

And only recently he hit eastern Ghouta with chemical weapons and people were -- they were just -- I mean, they are dead because of the chemical weapons, despite the siege, they are besieged for more than four years now, and he used chemical weapons against them. So where is the red line? No one knows. 

What do you think about what President Putin and Russia have done in Syria, the bombardment of Aleppo, coming to the aid of President Assad, intervening militarily in a way that President Obama said could not be done with devastating consequences? 

I think, first of all, it's misrepresentation. 

What is misrepresentation? 

It is a misrepresentation of the facts because according to him, he is fighting ISIS who is not in Aleppo. 

According to Putin? 

Yes. I think according to him, he is claiming one thing, but he is doing in reality -- 

You don't think the Russians bombarded Aleppo? 

No, I am thinking that -- I saw that they bombarded Aleppo. I am saying that according to their own news and according to himself, he is fighting ISIS, who has never been in Aleppo at that moment, so I think it is completely a misrepresentation of the facts and for me -- 

By President Putin? 

Yes. And I think what happens right now, when our president, new president, Trump wants to go with our soldiers into the Syrian grounds, this can be the biggest mistake for us because at the end of the day, it will be another death of innocent people. 

You mentioned President Trump and he has an executive order that bars Syrian refugees and indeed all Syrians temporarily from coming to the United States. How do you react to that? It seems almost cruel. 

I think it is a big mistake. I will tell why. If it was 20, 30 years ago, shutting door to the country, I think maybe it was right, but in these days when the terrorism operates in completely different grounds through the social media, I think first of all my suggestion to President Trump, to look for the root of the terrorism and to learn more about terrorism, like I was learning about these people. And I think if you understand the roots of the terrorism, then you can fight the terrorism. I suggest to cooperate more with intelligence that he is kind of avoiding to do, and to learn more about what is happening in our own country, because if you go back to the old terroristic attacks that we had here, none of these people came from Syria, none of these people came from these countries that we banned. But shutting the door in front of these people, innocent people who may be seeking shelter, they are seeking shelter. So I think it is the wrong thing because at the end of the day, shelter can be provided by all these radicals, and ISIS included, and these kids seeking shelter become the terrorists because they will be provided shelter by ISIS who knows how to brainwash the kids and keep them vulnerable. So I think the government needs to learn the roots of the terrorism and then to fight it in the proper way. This is different times than 30, 40 years ago when you are just shutting the borders and it helps you to fight terrorism. Terrorism is different these days. 

Kholoud, what is your reaction to the travel ban? You travel on a Syrian passport. I understand you had a hard time at the Salt Lake City Airport, you were detained there for an hour and a half or so. What do you make of this atmosphere that seems to be intent on portraying all Muslims as a potential threat? 

This is racism, first of all. And this is discrimination. I feel angry from the bottom of my heart, but it doesn't affect us Syrians like I mean, primarily, because the United States is not receiving Syrian refugees since the beginning. 

Very few. 

Very few. I mean, very few compared to other countries. 

Especially Germany. 

Especially Germany, yes. So, I mean, if they are not receiving people, then I mean, there are few people who have been received here. But the problem is those activists, including me, who every now and then try to make it to the states to talk to the people, speak to the media and meet prominent people, let's say from the congress or politicians, decision makers, to tell them about what is going on or to lobby for our cause. Now we are prevented to do this. 

Do you think you will go home one day? 

I will. Definitely. 

When? 

I don't know. 

And what Syria will you go home to? 

The Syria that I was dreaming about. 

You still believe that? 

Yes. 

What is the basis for your belief? Just hope and faith? 

And the sacrifice of my friends. We'll be traitors if we fail them, so I will continue with this until the end. 

Until the end of time? 

Either see this or die. And in both cases, I will be satisfied. 

Evgeny, it is hard to continue after that, but do you believe that your movie will help bring about the situation that Kholoud just described and that she will be able to -- is that a purpose of yours, a reason for making the movie? 

There is a main reason. Because I as a filmmaker believe in one thing. That we are responsible to learn about people and to tell their stories, to bring their voices to the entire world. And if I would be able to through this movie to change somebody's perception, to teach somebody, and to make people to change their minds, even a few, to change their lives, and then in my situation with this movie to save somebody's life. 

Kholoud, what would you like to see America do? 

Stop Assad from bombing Syrians, and our first agreement in 2012 when Assad started to use air jets, to have a no-fly zone. Nobody applied that. If anyone started to have a no-fly zone, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved at that time. 

Thank you very much. Truth is important. Facts are important. Remembering is important. Really powerful movie. Thank you very much. Evgeny and Kholoud, thank you. 

Thank you.
