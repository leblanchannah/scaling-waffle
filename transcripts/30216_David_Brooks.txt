Good evening. I'm Robert Costa, filling in for Charlie Rose. David Brooks is here. He has been an op-ed columnist for "The New York Times" since 2003. His writing spans the worlds of politics, culture, and the social sciences. His books include "Bobos in Paradise," "On Paradise Drive," and the "Social Animal." I am pleased to have David Brooks join me today. Welcome, David. 

It's good to be with you, and with you and wishing Charlie best healing. 

Exactly. Where are we in this moment in President Trump's first hundred days or so in office? 

Yeah, I think we're a bit at a pivot. And the one thing I give Trump credit for is understanding what debate we're having in this country. You and I grew up in a world where it was big government versus small government, the market versus the state, and that debate is over. Now the debate is open versus closed. Those who have the tailwinds of globalization blowing at their back to a greater opportunity, and those who had the headwinds pushing in their faces and they want closed trade, closed borders. And we see that in this country. The Dutch are about to have an election. The French are about to have an election. And it's the same set of issues in all these places. And so we're at a moment when we've got a new political debate, and that creates not necessarily new alignments, but the parties take new positions, and sometimes swap positions. And we're sort of in the middle of that, I think. 

Where are we, though, in this realignment? Because when we see the health-care debate, Speaker Ryan is taking the lead. He says he's working in coordination with President Trump, and in many ways it's a mainstream Republican health-care plan. It doesn't have the flashes of populism that we may have imagined. Is Trump moving towards the mainstream GOP, the orthodoxy he has rejected? 

Yeah, I think he's a transitional figure. And my colleague, Ross Douthat and my friend, Ray Hunselon have written this. He's more like Jimmy Carter in that you had a certain democratic party, and then you had a democratic president with a Democratic House and Democratic Senate. You would think a lot would get done, but they weren't quite the old George McGovern democrats, but they weren't quite the new Bill Clinton democrats. They were just in the middle there. And as a result, there was a lot of incoherence. And so I think Trump is a sign of that incoherence, and so he's -- if you take the two power centers here in Washington right now, who I would say are Paul Ryan and Steve Bannon. Paul Ryan is pretty much -- he grew up through Empower America, which was a republican organization here in town, and it's pretty much the Reagan republican worldview, less government, more freedom. Steve Bannon represents a nationalist worldview, the working class people, the heart of our society are being hurt, let's give them some security. And so one wants to reduce government to enhance freedom and embrace risk, and the populists want to tighten down to increase security. And what's odd to me about this health-care plan, which is really much more Ryan than Bannon, is that it introduces more risk to people's lives, and it takes away social support. And so as we sit here, we don't know how many people are going to be denied insurance, but it's going to be millions, maybe eight, ten, 15 million. And so that's the Trump base. And what's odd to me about this health-care plan is it's declaring war on the people who voted for the Republican President by denying them security of these insurance plans, by taking subsidies that would go to them and using it for tax cuts for the rich, and then increasing risk in their lives. And I happen to be a guy who likes the idea of tax credits so people can buy insurance. But there's no question it increases risk. It puts the onus on us as individuals, and as family members, to make those choices and shop in that marketplace and bear those deductibles. And so I just don't think the Bannon wing of the party wants risks, wants to be deprived of the resources, and wants to live in a more uncertain world. And so, to me, we're sort of -- the health care reveals a party that is neither here hither nor yon. 

So if Bannon is really the soul of the Trump Presidency in terms of his populism and nationalism, why is it Speaker Ryan who is driving the process? 

Yeah, we were talking before, I want to write a column called "Let Bannon be Bannon." Like let him run the show. At least it would be coherent. I don't agree with the guy. I find him a little obnoxious maybe, but he has a coherent worldview, and he knows who his people are, and he's going to defend them. The Ryan/Bannon mixture is an incoherent mixture, and that's why this bill is disliked on all wings of the party, because it's neither hither nor there. And so the reason I think the Ryan and the congressional plan is taking over, A, they've been at this a lot longer. They've been coming up with various plans for years now. And, B, and more importantly, there's just no functioning White House apparatus. The administration has not even -- they've not even nominated people for the whole host of jobs. You just can't do -- the White House is the principals, these four or five people actually make decisions, and then all these scads of deputies, and those deputies are just not there throughout the administration, so you go to the State Department, the Treasury, and the Defense Department, and the secretaries, secretary, the big bosses, they're probably making the coffee, sweeping the floor, because there's no one else sticking around. And so you can't run a White House with four people. You just can't get anything done. 

And you wrote recently about how this health-care proposal could cause some disruption, and you look at the Medicaid aspect of the plan, and it phases out the Medicaid expansion by 2020. Some conservatives even want to move that date up. 

Right. 

Trump is someone who said early on he wants to provide coverage for everybody. He doesn't want to have this kind of disruption. But dealing with the Republican congress, it seems to be moving in that direction. What's the political consequence for this new President? I think for the whole party it's going to be onerous. The basic logic is this, the Republicans want to cut taxes, and there's things called the "net investment tax cut," which would only apply to people making over $250,000. It's the top one percent sort of deal. They want to get rid of that. But the more you cut those taxes, the more you got to reduce benefits, because you have to be budget neutral, at least in theory. And so you're got this basic pendulum. And so the tax cuts are bringing down -- going to bring down benefits, whether it's Medicaid or the size of the tax credit, for people on those working and middle income voters. And to me, the thing to do is to embrace a tax credit approach, a market-based approach, but do it at sufficient levels so that it actually provides support, increased support for everybody, which was what the Trump goals were. We'll keep people protected. We understand that capitalism is not basically working for people, but we're going to do it through market mechanisms. That seems to be where the future of the Republican Party is going. A different method of delivery but to provide some benefits for people. But the current republicans, whether it's Rand Paul or Ted Cruz, the main problem still in their mind is too much government, too much government. And I would just ask them, where have you been for the last 18 months? Did you not watch this election? I mean, you keep writing about how the Republican Party has to meet this moment. But it seems like whenever I'm at the Capitol and talking to members of the house and the senate, they almost feel pulled by this tide. They've been running against this health-care law ever since it was enacted, and they just feel compelled for base reasons, from pressure from the right, to just repeal and replace and to not really think through the full moment politically. 

Yeah. Well, there's a saying that intellectual progress rides in a hearse; meaning that people change their mind they just die off, and somebody new has to come along. And I think there's some element of that; that the republican orthodoxy has been so baked in that people go along with what they've been saying all along. It's just what they come it. It's hard to change your mind midlife. But I do think you got to look back and say, hey, what just happened to American politics? And, you know, my basic rule about Trump is he's the wrong answer to the right question. And the right question is that capitalism isn't working for people, and our social fabric has decayed to a degree that we're unfamiliar with, at least at the bottom income levels of society. And we can't just leave people on their own anymore. There's a guy in town who I'm sure we both know named Grover Norquist who used to be an advocate for something called the "Leave us Alone Coalition." 

That's right. 

All conservatives disagreed on a lot of things, but they all believe government should just leave us alone. Well that's not working anymore, because the social fabric is too frayed. Too many people lack the skills to get jobs. Too many people are dropping out of the labor force. Too many families are broken up. Opiate addiction is too rampant. You can't just leave people alone anymore, so republicans have to adjust and say I've got my method to help people along, and it's not going to be what the democrats want. It's not going to look like the great society, but it will help people to solidify the social fabric and to give people access to the new job market. 

So do you think republicans and President Trump may have made a mistake by beginning with health care, then looking to tax reform and perhaps not -- they didn't start with infrastructure. They didn't start with some of the more populist sides of his campaign. 

Right, that's my let down on -- I would've started with infrastructure, because, A, you can get a chance at bipartisan support and that's so important early in an administration. And, B, have you looked around at American political history for the last 20 years? Clinton, Obama, pretty much every administration who has taken up health care, it's ended up biting them in the rear. And so one of the things, you know, for those of us who have covered administration after administration, their first selection of policy is always a product of hubris. George W. Bush decided the first thing I'm going to do my second term is social security privatization reform. And that was a big mistake, because it muddied the water for any kind of bipartisanship, and it introduced more risk into people's lives, which they did not want. And I would say, frankly, the same thing of Obama. He did the stimulus package first, necessitated by events. But if Obama had said, well what political moment are we in? What I really worry about is inequality, and so every program I'm going to focus on is going to go after those working class voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Wisconsin. If he had done that, democrats wouldn't have lost the House, they wouldn't have lost the Senate, they wouldn't have lost the White House. But, instead, he did health care, which was a legitimate problem. But given our political moment, it was a secondary problem not a primary problem. 

You wrote recently that President Trump's address to Congress was Trumpism at its best. If that was Trumpism at its best, what's been Trumpism at its worst in terms of perhaps the President's behavior, his allegations about some kind of surveillance of Trump Tower? What's the worst, if that's the best? 

At least -- there are so many worsts. There's a succession of worst. But the worst I'm disturbed by at the moment -- and Trump's character is him at his worst. The thing I liked about the speech was his character was sort of off to the side and it was just the subject and the policy areas. But the thing that I think I worry about the most this week -- I'll have a new worst next -- is the de-legitimization of our institutions. And so we live in Washington. I live inside the beltway, and so maybe that's suspect. But I spend a lot of time with people who work in the federal agencies. I went to the congressional budget office recently, a year or two ago, and was there and met all the economists. And they work really hard. And at the Bureau Labor of Statistics, they work really hard. Our intelligence agencies, they work really hard. Most of them are not big political thinkers. They just believe in what they're doing. They're trying to serve the country. They just want some clear direction. Let them do their jobs. They're not super ideological partisans. And what I think Trump is doing is he's delegitimizing the job numbers that come out of the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. The studies that come out of the CBO which are excellent, by the way, sometimes wrong, but we all get things wrong, and then all the basic institutions of our government. And if people lose faith in that, I don't care what your agenda is, we can't get anything done. We have to have some basic faith in our institutions. And I think one of the reasons the country is pretty great is that we have a basically, functioning government, basically non-corrupt compared to everywhere else around the world. Basically accurate in its good faith service to what the jobs are. 

The legitimacy point is so important, because if you looked at most of the republicans who ran in the primary last time, they wanted to take an ax to the federal government and cut a lot of these agencies. But it's the way Trump and his associates talk about them that's delegitimizing; we keep hearing this term come out of the White House the "deep state." 

Yeah. 

And it's a way of framing the intelligence community in an almost conspiratorial tone. 

Yeah. It's paranoia. And it is a sort of intellectual pollution. You know, republicans have always wanted to cut the size of government. Fine. But if you ask people in previous republican administrations, Reagan, the Bushes, even very conservative people, what do you think of the career people you worked with, the career bureaucrats or the civil servants? Everyone will say they were surprisingly good. And that's always been my experience when I go in and sit in on a meeting off the record in one of the agencies. I'm always saying these people are pretty impressive, and they're not making a lot of money. They do it maybe because they like some job security, but they also believe in the mission of their agency and they believe in the country. And so you can have more of them or less of them, but to say they're rigged, to say that the jobs numbers are rigged, to say that President Obama meant Obama Care to fall apart in 2017, to say that the CAIB intelligence agencies are malevolently out to get somebody is just inaccurate, and it's a form of corrosive cynicism that just tears at the social fabric. 

You've written about how President Trump has gone after some of these core tenets of the Republican Party, including the hawkish consensus on foreign policy. How has the President revealed himself, if in any way so far, on foreign policy? 

Yeah, I mean I would say he's threatening the liberal world order. I mean this has been an article of faith in the party, and in both parties, really, that the main threat is either communism or fascism or authoritarianism, people who don't play by the rules. And what we have to do is create a set of world order which is based on NATO and the EU and our Asian alliances and the WTO. And they sound technocratic and unspiritual. But it's a set of world order and we're all going to play by the rules. And by the way, we're not going to pick and choose what rules we play by. We're going to cooperate and all play by the rules. And some of those rules are, you don't invade your neighbors. And, you know, so that order has sort of held us together. And I think that order has been one of the great historical achievements mostly, and it was led by the U.S. And what Trump embodies is a different mentality. The people who created this world order, the big institutions, George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, those guys, they thought it was not us versus the world, it was us amplifying our power by cooperating with the world. And those things like NATO, they were expansions of American power. Trump has a much more zero-sum worldview. If they're doing well, we're doing badly, and therefore, we've got to do well and make them do badly. And he made that speech at the joint session speech, "I'm not President of the world, I'm President of the United States." That would never have occurred to Dwight Eisenhower, because that distinction does not exist. And so what I think he's ending up doing is, first, he's weakening American power, because he's getting us out of these institutions which would enhance it, and he's letting more room for the wolves of the world, like the Vladimir Putins, to do their mischief. 

But how deeply invested is President Trump in this worldview? Is this coming from Steve Bannon, or is this something you think the President himself is committed to? 

I don't know for sure, but I have heard people in the real estate business, in his sort of real estate business, say every deal is zero sum; that if you're buying a property or something, if one side of the deal does well, the other side is going to do badly. It's not like a lot of realms of business where we cut a deal and we both do well. And so that sort of zero-sum worldview I do think pervades his thinking. 

Where does the relationship with Russia and Putin stand in your view? 

Yeah, well, to me, the crucial fact is what does Russia have on him? Why are we talking about Russia so much? I mean, Russia is a significant country, but it hasn't dominated American foreign policy for the last 15 years. But suddenly everything is Russia, Russia, Russia. And, you know, so this aid has Russia ties, that aid, that aid. And they're mysteries, like Paul Manafort was a guy, a former figure in the Republican Party with strong Russia ties. Suddenly out of the blue he becomes chief of staff of the Trump campaign. 

Campaign chairman. 

How did that happen? 

And they changed the platform to make it more pro-Russia. 

So why is Russia so dominant in Trump world? I want to know why that happened. 

Everyone does. 

Yeah. And it could be -- you know, it could be because at a time when he was post-bankruptcy, he couldn't find anybody to invest, and there were a lot of Russian investors, or at least Russian buyers. But we just don't know what that is because of the tax returns, because they're not public. And it's hard to know what our foreign policy toward Russia is until we know the source of the obsession with Russia within Trump world. 

Who are the moral arbiters within the Republican Party right now? If the President, in your view, is delegitimizing institutions and changing world order, who are the voices to counter it? Because one column that so sticks out with me is your column about the Faustian Bargain that so many republicans have made; that they'll get health care and they'll get taxes as long as they just kind of go along with the rest of the Trump plan. 

Yeah. I'm not sure they're going to get any of that either. But, you know, they go along because they see opportunities for their agenda, which is fine. They go along because Trump has 85 percent approval among republican voters, which is fine. The problem is there's so much baggage comes along, and so much in terms of character, in terms of foreign policy. And so what I'm beginning to see on Capitol Hill, particularly in the Senate, is a bunch of republicans who, I think, are behaving pretty well. You know, if they were like me, you know, they'd be all anti-Trump and they'd be hammering. But they're not going to be like me. I'm probably to their left on a lot of issues, and I don't have to have republican voters vote for me to keep my job. But I would say they're trying to improve Trump. They're trying to respect him. They're trying to move him. They're being brave enough to criticize him. 

Who? 

Some people who -- the expected ones like Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Susan Collins. Some who are expected and who are really outstanding human beings who do it out of conscience and because they're good senators and citizens, Rob Portman of Ohio, but even some I tend to disagree with more. Ted Cruz, I think, is behaving in a role that I find responsible. He's not just a showman anymore. He's trying to move things substantively. I think Marco Rubio is doing a very good job. He's been tough on Russia but trying to be helpful and cooperative. And this has been something we see all the time in American politics, and this goes back to the Iraq War. There are some people who are critical in order to get on the Sunday shows. But there are some people that are critical in order to be helpful. And that spirit of helpfulness is something that I'm beginning to see in a lot of Republican Senators. And it's one of the nicer things, to see all these people emerge from the shadows. 

What about Ryan, Speaker Ryan and leader McConnell? 

Yeah, I think they're in a tougher position. You know, I guess I wish Paul Ryan had said we've got a party that has got a lot of different factions and, like it or not, I just got to pick one. Now they did tax credits in the health-care bill. But it seems to me he has not settled upon a top-to-bottom philosophy of where we are as a country and what we need in the way that Steve Bannon does have a top-to-bottom philosophy. And so I just wish -- Paul Ryan's from a working class area in Wisconsin, and so I would like him to say, okay, there's a new situation facing my people in Janesville, or wherever he's from. And the government has to be a little different than it was when I was working in Washington in the 1980s, and I'm not sure he's gotten there yet. He's a very respectable, very good guy. I just think intellectually one doesn't see the sort of coherence one sees in a lot of other people. 

You've been traveling a lot more since the election. And when you are out there in different states, different towns and cities giving talks or teaching, how are working-class Americans of both parties reacting to this first two, three months of the Trump Presidency? Is this something they want to see succeed? Are they alarmed in any way? 

Yeah. I've become a little hesitant to speak on behalf of working class -- 

I know, but just you're anecdotal observation. 

I guess one of the things I would say is I see a lot of people who want him to succeed, and even a lot of people who didn't vote for him. They don't want to give up on this presidency. And so they would like to see some success. And I see also a lot of realism. You know, how many times have we heard somebody in the coffee shop -- or I go to a bar. I call it reporting, others call it drinking -- and say, You know, I wish that guy would put away his tweeter, or, you know, whatever, his phone. And so they're realistic. People are very good at disaggregating the nonsense, the circus part of Trump from what they hope for him. And so I would say I see not many people who were pro-Trump who have given up on him, and not a lot of hostility. I see a lot of realism that we knew we were kind of getting this package, and we're still getting it. I'm looking to see how it shakes out. But the people who were pro-Trump are still pro-Trump for sure. 

And the President, later this week, is going to be going to Nashville, and he's going to be paying some kind of tribute there to Andrew Jackson. And I think this comes back to that Bannon influence. 

Right. 

What do you make of this continued association the White House is making with Andrew Jackson? 

Yeah, I mean it is -- to me it's a bit of a -- I guess Donald Trump is no Jackson to me. And Jackson wasn't the greatest thing either. But what Trump's nationalism strikes me as is much closer to the nationalism we're seeing around the world, the nationalism we're seeing in Holland or the nationalism we're seeing in Austria or in the UK, the UK party. And that's not a typical American nationalism. The Trump nationalism is the good folk, the simple folk of this country have the purity and the virtue and the wisdom, and it's very backward looking. It's very historicist; that it existed in the past. It was in the peasants, as they would say in Russia, and that it's being corrupted by outside forces; immigrants, globalists, Davos people. And that's just not the way Americans have defined their nationalism. 

Because you've written for years about how you'd like to see the politics of this country move more toward national greatness and the idea of American greatness. 

Yeah. 

But you're saying there's a real difference between kind of John McCain style republican of a few years ago American greatness and what Trump's articulating. 

Yeah, and the first thing to say is I really defend nationalism. A lot of people are against nationalism. But that's like being against religion. Religion can be used in good ways or it can be used for bad political ways. Now if we don't have nationalism, if we turn into a bun of Brussels people or Davos people, you get this deracinated, disenchanted, amoral style of politics. You've got to have a unifying national idea. But the American idea was not based on looking to the past. It was based on a forward unitive dream of the future. The religious term is eschatology, the belief in the end of times, and whether it was Alexander Hamilton or the founders or Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan, the definition of America is what we're shooting toward, toward the future, and we saw the President from the vantage point of the future. And when the people were crossing Tennessee, one of the things the foreigners noticed, the observers noticed, they'd come to a valley, which had great farmland, but they'd keep going west because they assumed there would be something even better on the other side of the next valley. And that was the American spirit; that it was future looking, not backwards. So we weren't so much tied to the past. And that created a culture in which we moved more, we started companies more, we created industries more, because it was always dynamic moving forward. And what's been interesting to me, at the same time you have this backward looking nationalism of Bannon, maybe Trump, we've also become a culture of where we move less. Entrepreneurial rates are down. And so we've become less dynamic. I think we've become less American. And I support nationalism that rekindles that sense of we've got to be on the move. 

How are the democrats responding to all these swirling forces and to Trump? 

Well they're a little off to the side right now, because the fight is within the Republican Party, say, on health care. I think they have not yet found their voice either. The people farthest along are the progressives that have a coherent worldview. And what you don't have on the left, which I think I'm waiting for, is a group of people who are going to say, okay, this guy, Donald Trump, is for closed, closed trade, closed borders, no ethnic diversity. So we're going to be for open. We're unabashedly going to be for open. We're going to be for ethnic diversity. We're going to be for open social mores. We're going to be for open trade, relatively open immigration. We're going to embrace global capitalism, and because we believe in its dynamism, and we're going to make it work. We're going to make it work for everybody. You haven't seen that. You haven't seen a modernization of the Clinton paradigm, which would be pro open, pro globalization, but in a functioning way. And I'm waiting for that person to emerge. Hillary Clinton could have been that person if she'd said, no, I'm for TPP, I'm for trade. I've been for trade all my life. I believe we need the dynamism, but we're just going to make the rules a little different. But she couldn't quite get herself there because it would have caused this fracture on her left. 

No one in either party seems to want to make that kind of pitch. I was reading through "Bobos in Paradise" the other day, and I was wondering to myself, what happened to this country that David wrote about? Not too long ago, it was so about the ascended America, embracing technology, embracing globalization, and now, if you even talk in those terms politically, democrat or republican, you're seen as somewhat -- you're the past. 

Yeah. I mean, parts of "Bobos in Paradise" are still there, Whole Foods and Restoration Hardware, they still exist. But the spirit is totally different. The post-World War spirit -- I wrote that book in the '90s, 2000. Silicon Valley was booming, and we had just won the Cold War. Capitalism looked like it was on the march. The American model looked like it was on the march. Well, and I guess what I would say has happened is that the 21st century happened, and the 21th century started on 9/11, and it's been marked by 16 or 17 straight years where the number of democracies in the world has gone down. The number of authoritarian governments has gone up. The level of ethnic separatism and ethnic nationalism has risen, and you've got people trying to build walls, trying to build walls around this country, trying to build walls in Europe. You've got religious fanaticism in the Middle East. You've got terrorism throughout the world. And so it's been an ugly start to the century. And as a result, the spirit of hope and the spirit of optimism and the spirit that history marches toward progress has been lost, and everybody thinks things are going in a bad direction, and everybody's in a bad mood. 

Let's talk about ethnic nationalism for a minute, because a lot of republicans I talk to in my reporting, they don't ever really want to broach that topic. But then you see congressmen like Steve King of Iowa, had a tweet over the weekend, where he alluded, in a sense, to ethnic nationalism, and even white nationalism. And it's there, it's out in the open on the republican side. Maybe on the democratic side too. But what are we to make of all this, this flurry of ethnic nationalism within the Trump movement? 

Yeah I think it's -- you know, I don't know how much of it is in there, it's there clearly. And I would, again, differentiate between racism and nationalism. You can be proudly pro-American and not be a racist. But there clearly is a lot of racism. And there's clearly a lot of fear, which drives just fear of the other, and a sense of contamination. You know, the Dutch are going to have these elections I keep mentioning. And there you've got a party and candidate who is explicitly -- more explicitly than Americans actually, saying, we've got to have more people like us and fewer like them, meaning fewer Muslims. And that's just we've got to preserve our ethnic purity, our cultural purity. And America has never really believed in that, because we've always been a pretty ethnically and culturally diverse nation. But you're beginning to see this European style of ethnic nationalism exist here as people want to preserve -- want a country that looks like themselves. Or at least white people do. And on the one hand I sort of get it. It's revolutionary that we've gone from a country where large swaths of it were largely white to a country where the -- especially among the young, it's minority/majority. Minority, majority, minority, whatever. And so I get the fact that this is a radical social experiment. But what I don't get is the intense sense of pessimism about this experiment, because as we become a more diverse country I think we become a safer country. Crime rates have plummeted. We've become a more interesting culture. We've become a more tolerant culture. And so what interests me about the Trump worldview is how fear-driven it is. How the assumption is that crime rates are soaring, when, in fact, crime rates are falling. The assumption that opportunity is plummeting and everyone is getting screwed, when the fact is a lot of good things happening in this country. And so it's fear and enforcement. And so what strikes me about the term "world view" is it's, A, fear based; and, B, the remedy is always intimidation. It's never compassion. And so it's just this dark angry view of the world, which then manifests itself in an ethnic nationalist role. 

So, David, finally, as we all navigate this new environment, you wrote recently that thinking about politics in the age of Trump means relying less on the knowledge of political science and more on the probings of D. H. Lawrence, David Foster Wallace, and Carl Jung. Explain what that means. 

Yeah, I'm about to get extremely Charlie Rose on us. So I do think things have deteriorated in some ways, and mostly the social fabric has deteriorated. There's a guy, Rusty Reno, who has a phrase, the crisis of solidarity. And to me, that's what we're suffering from. We're just less close to one another across class, within our communities. Our social capital is down, and so we're more isolated in fundamental ways. And, to me, that happened for philosophical reasons. We made mistakes. And here's where the Charlie Rose moment comes, and that's because we chose the wrong philosophers. We chose John Stuart Mill when we should have chosen Martin Buber. What I mean by that is Mill sees us as a series of individuals, a very individualistic worldview. Martin Buber wrote a book called "I and Thou." He sees us as a bunch of relationships. And so we became too individualistic when we should be a little more communitarian. We also chose Jeremy Bentham instead of Viktor Frankl. Jeremy Bentham thought that we were motivated by pleasure and pain. Viktor Frankl thought we're motivated by a search for meaning, to want to lead good lives. And so in my view our society has become too economic, too social sciency, and too utilitarian, and not enough moralistic. And then finally, we chose Réne Descartes when we should have chosen St. Augustine. And Réne Descartes thought we should think with our heads, that we're primarily cognitive, rational creatures. Augustine thought we're primarily emotional, loving creatures, and so we've become too cognitive when we should be more emotional. And so basically we've turned into shells of ourselves and that's cut down on intimacy, and it's had these devastating social effects. But it's ideas that drive behavior, and I think we have some of the wrong ideas.
