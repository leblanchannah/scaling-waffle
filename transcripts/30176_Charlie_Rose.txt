We'll be back in just a moment with Paul McCartney. But first, a look at a special that's going to be on public television. His new performance in Liverpool that he composed. Here it is. (video playing) 

Welcome to the broadcast. 

Thank you. 

Pleasure to have you here. Don't do that to me from the beginning. 

I'm not going to do it. I'm going to answer civilly and sensibly. 

Let me just talk about this. Going back to Liverpool, how did this oratorio get started? I mean, this is - you're talking about your roots, your home, your place? 

What happened was, about two years ago, the orchestra commissioned me, and Carl Davis, who I wrote it with. They said, would you - can we commission you to write a piece that will help us celebrate 150 years in the orchestra business? That's how long the orchestra has been going. So I'd been flirting with classical sounds with The Beatles, and with Yesterday, and Eleanor Rigby, and certain things there. I'd sort of used French horns early on, and I used a piccolo trumpet once on Penny Lane. So I'd always loved all of this. I'd been intrigued with the whole idea. But I never really dared do it. It's quite a big move to make. But suddenly, I had an offer. They said, well, you know it's Liverpool. You know about Liverpool. They said, it's a great orchestra. It's to be performed in the cathedral, which was my kind of local cathedral. My school that I spent all my time from like 11 till 17 at, overlooked the cathedral. So, and John Lennon went to the arts school next door. So it's all so connected. I just said, yep, I'll do it. 

I'll do it. Was it hard? Was it more difficult than you thought? 

No, it was easier than I thought. 

Why? 

Because I love music. I'm a big music fan. And when you work in rock 'n roll, people tend to think, well, that's what he must listen to, that's what he must like. But I've got a pretty broad taste in music. I mean, one of my favorite records of all time is Fred Astaire singing Cheek to Cheek. I just love. If it's a good record - 

What is it you love about it? 

About Cheek to Cheek? 

Yeah. 

I love his voice. I love his style. 

The elegance. 

The backing out of the words. Heaven - It's just great. It's just always been a favorite of mine. And some of my rock 'n roll friends might sort of laugh at it, and say, well, what are you doing? But I still think it's a great thing. 

Because there are some people who have tried to crossover to classical. I mean, Andrew Lloyd Webber has had some trouble with Requiem. Some people didn't think it was as good as it might have been. Did it give you any trepidation? 

No. I'm one of these people, whenever I get a kind of offer like that, I just go into it totally. I'm gung ho. It's about halfway through that I realize that I should have gone into it with some trepidation. It's only about half way. I was in a pub, I used to go to this pub just before I met up with my collaborator. It happened, there was an Irish actor in there, and he was talking - I was talking about what I was doing. He said, but aren't you scared stiff? I said, not really. But of course, then I thought, maybe I should be. Maybe he's right. Maybe I shouldn't be taking this all so easy. But it wasn't a question of taking it easy. When you asked was it hard or easy, it just seemed an easy thing for me to do, because I love making up music. This, obviously, was a whole different palette from anything I'd used before. 

But the skills of a songwriter that you had, melody is something that comes easy to you? 

Well, you know, I'd read articles over the last 20 years, by people like Leonard Bernstein and stuff, and they'd single me out, and they'd say, you know, that guy McCartney's not bad, you know. And there's a French cellist called Tortelier who sort of said that all the modern composers, that plink-plonk music is no good. We do not like to play this. Maybe this should be the melodies. So I always said, I can do that. I can do it. I know what he's talking about. I don't - I'm interesting in some plink-plonk music, but generally I like a bit of a melody to get a hold of. 

And counterpoint too, you're known for that. 

Well, you know, I don't really know what the official explanations are for what I'm doing. There was a famous article that John and I had on us by William Mann of the Times, who is no longer with us, but it was a great article. It was all about The Beatles and the Aeolian cadences. 

And you said, what? 

What pentatonic clusters? We said, what's a pentatonic cluster? He said, you know, I think it was the end of She Loves You, was that. But the point being, you know, that we always loved doing this stuff. We got very involved, and our Beatles stuff is quite arranged. Something like Day in the Life, it's quite an orchestrally conceived - 

But there are those who would say, for all of his genius, for all of his greatness, for all of his experience, McCartney doesn't read or write music. 

Well, that's true. But I've never - 

Let that stand in your way? 

I never thought it was a drawback. In fact, there's many times I had tried to learn. And I decided not to. Now, I don't think I really want to learn now. I've got a kind of superstitious feeling that I'll learn too much. See, I work with people, somebody like Carl, Carl Davis, is a great talent. I mean, he used to be a child prodigy on the piano, and he can write music down. He's just phenomenal that way. But I notice, when he comes to write a melody, he knows Schubert's work, he knows Mahler's work, he knows all the stuff I don't know. I mean, I've vaguely heard. 

Listened to it, but yeah. 

I know the sort of Nutcracker Suite and the sort of popular stuff. And what I find is he starts to wander into a Schubert melody. Now, I think it's an advantage that I don't know where Schubert went. 

Because it gives you more freedom and more license? 

I don't know where to go. And that's what the fun is for me. When I start off on a journey, I don't know where I'm going to end up. So, it was very exciting that way. And I think, maybe, that is why I shouldn't learn. 

Did you think about John, because you were back writing about Liverpool? Because you said it at some point, that he would love the risk that you were taking. 

Yeah. I don't know if he'd have wanted to do it himself, but yeah, I think he would have liked the idea of suddenly jumping out of your skin and doing something else that was alien to you. I did think about John once or twice in writing. There's a character in the second movement - it's not so much a character, it's a thought that the main male character has in the second movement. He talks about sagging off, which a Liverpool way of playing hooky. A Liverpool word. 

Sagging off. 

Sagging off. 

Which means what? Just to go away and take the day off? 

Taking the day off, taking the afternoon off, maybe. They noticed it you took the day off. So you clock in, in the morning have lunch, and I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea here. Children? 

Children? 

Don't do this. 

Only after you come home from school. 

Very bad. But we used to do that. And I must admit, the school scene was a little bit - getting a little bit sort of pious. So I threw in this attitude. And as I did, I thought yeah, this was me, John, taking time off, because he went to the college next door. 

When did you first meet him? 

I met John when - I think when I was about 15 or so. I had a friend, a very good friend of mine called Ivan Vaughan, who I went to school with, was born on exactly the same day as I was, so we became friends because of that. And he lived in a place called Woolton. And he said, I've got this great mate, you know. I've got this great mate. You should meet him, you know. And I says, well, you know. And he said, look, they're playing. This mate's got a bit of the group, they used to call skiffle groups. It's an early kind of acoustic blues kind of things. Lots of guitars. They used to have washboards. Kind of country and western, I suppose. 

That's where I'm from, North Carolina, so I understand it. 

But it's the old-fashioned type, you know? Not the new sort of slick type. It's the real old washboards and okay, boy. And John used to have this skiffle group, and he said, they're playing on Saturday at Woolton village fete. He said, you should come along. So I said, great. And I remember coming into the fete, and seeing these people on the stage, and seeing John in checked shirt, with a sort of coif, and singing this song. He was singing this song - 

A 'do? 

It was the fete, wasn't it? And he was there, and he was doing great, and he was looking great, and everything. But he was singing all the wrong words. It was a song called Come Go With Me, by the Dell Vikings. Because he was supposed to be skiffle group, he didn't have the record. So he just made it up. He was kind of, come go with me, to the penitentiary. Hey. And he was making all this stuff up. Who is this person? But then I met him a little later that day, and I was surprised at how drunk and horrible he was. Because I was younger then. 

16, a bad influence on you, was he? 

Well, he was getting a six-pack down him, it was Saturday, and he was getting going. I was later to learn those tricks, but I was a little bit innocent at the time. I remember this guy, his smelly breath over my shoulder, so I was, who is this fellow. 

And when did you get together after that? How long before you began to say - 

We played around backstage that day. My friend took me backstage. It was a little church hall. Anyone could have gone in. But we just went along there. And a few of the guys were just sitting around waiting for the evening performance. They played in the afternoon at the fete and then did an evening thing. And we were jamming around, and I knew this song called Twenty Flight Rock, by Eddie Cochran, and I knew all of the words. And this was great currency in those days. 

To know the words? 

If you knew all the words, you could, they wanted you in a group. 

Even if you couldn't sing? 

Because he knows the words to it. This is like, we can chuck him out next week, but he knows the words. We often traveled miles to get the words to it, or record B7. We went clear across Liverpool to get a set. 

To find a chord. 

Yes. It was a great one. I still know it. 

Do you? Can you give it to me? 

No, sorry. But yeah, you know. It was just - 

Did it start after that? 

So what happened was after that jamming thing, I just went back home and forgot about it all. And I was cycling around that area, about a week afterwards, and one of the fellows of the group came up, and he was on his bike, too. He said, hey, they want you to join the group. They thought that was great. You knew all the words. 

They wanted more songs. That's what they said. Before you come in, do you know any more words? 

Sure. That's right. Well, basically, I only knew that one. But it was enough. And George Harrison, I got George in the group later, because he knew a song called Raunchy. 

So you had two songs? 

So we had two songs then, and John didn't know Come Go With Me, so we were safe. 

And the rest is history? 

It was very innocent. It was really nice. And so we just got together a band. And we were terrible. We were very, very bad. And we just went - we were very bad for a few years, we sort of got off to Hamburg and improved a bit, because we were just working so long. 

Was there a moment in which you knew this is, we are going to be bigger than anything the world has ever seen? 

I think when we came to America, we started to think that kind of thought. We always thought, yeah, we're kind of maybe better than a couple of the little local groups we're playing with, but we never realized that it would be the big phenomenon, I think, until we came to America. And it was so huge here. And the thing was, you see, all the British acts who had come before us had never come back huge. They'd always been like third on the bill to Bobby Rydell and Frankie Avalon, and stuff. And we were saying, third on the bill? To them. You're number one in our country. We think you ought to top bills. So it always used to look a bit embarrassing when our great stars came back after having been on a not very good tour. So we actually made one of the cheekiest decisions I think The Beatles ever made. We said to our manager, we're not going to America until we're number one. 

Yeah. 

Which is a fairly kind of - 

Did you jointly? You did? 

Yeah. 

Was that your idea, was it John's idea? 

No, it was the group. 

You just got together? 

Because of these British stars who would come back with a sort of - slightly, not improved and improve their image. We said, well, if we go, it could kill us stone dead. We'll go, we'll be third on the bill to Fabian or someone. 

Frankie Avalon. 

Frankie. 

Bobby Rydell. 

You know what I mean. Those kind of secondary guys. They weren't Elvis. It wasn't Chuck Berry. It wasn't the main guys, Little Richard and stuff. 

Otis Redding? 

Otis Redding. It wasn't any of those guys. These were even perceived in their own country as sort of second strings, I think. We liked them. 

Of those guys, who influenced you the most? 

Little Richard was a big influence on me. Because I do a sort of screamy thing that's directly based on what he does. Yes, Richard, if you're watching, I admit it all. He's always doing so, he's like I told you that, Paul. Woo. Oh, come on Paul, you know I did, Richard. Well, it's true Richard, you did. And so I owe him a lot. 

And now you've paid him back. 

This is it, yeah. I've paid in full, Richard. But I doubt he's going to be watching this show. 

Oh, of course he will. 

We'll get him a tape. 

We will. 

Elvis was probably the big influence. But I never liked - I think all of us went off Elvis after he joined the Army. 

Yeah. You? 

Went off him. Started to dislike what he did. Because he was so magical before the Army. 

What was magical about him? 

He looked great. 

Yeah, he did. 

You know, which was - he just looked great. Whenever you saw photos of him, it's like, who's that, wow. And then I think he was like one of the world's greatest vocalists. He has a heck of a voice, Elvis. 

It was that good at that time. 

I think so, yeah. I was a major fan. When he went into the Army, it all got all a bit - sort of, you know, yes sir. Sir. 

You can do it, too. 

And the songs went downhill. Sort of Hardheaded Woman and stuff. Trombone solo. Sorry, love. 

And after that, though, who? Any other Americans? 

Yeah. Buddy Holly, big influence on us all. Buddy Holly allowed John to wear glasses. John had had these big thick horn-rimmed glasses, but he'd always have to take them off if girls were around. So it made it very difficult, we had to sort of lead him on stage, and he was, where is it? Which way are they? They're out there, son. Sing. So when Buddy Holly came along, he was able to sort of take these out and wear them proudly, so Buddy was a big influence. 

It was a great time to be single for you guys. 

Mmm. I'll go along with that. 

Yes. If you could be anything when you were that age, you wanted to be The Beatles. You just imagined. It wasn't riding in the limousines, it was just the women. 

I mean, you know. If you think about it, with now, I often liken it to a minefield. It's like walking through a minefield. I mean, now there's AIDS. In my dad's day, there was all sorts of sickness. 

Syphilis or whatever. 

Syphilis and stuff. Pregnancies. 

Right. 

But suddenly, there was this pill, and there didn't seem to be any sort of threatening diseases. 

The pill was freedom. 

So it suddenly changed things. Girls became apparently sort of rather available, and who was I to turn it down, or who were you? I blame the hormones, myself. 

You had no choice? They made you do it? Your hormones made you do it? 

They looked bountiful. My hormones made me do it, guv. Your worship. 

The break-up, was it hard for you? 

Yeah, very difficult, yeah. 

Why was it? 

Well, like I said, they were sort of my best mates in the world. There were four of us against the world, and then suddenly, it wasn't like that. In fact, one time, it was three against me, because I had decided to not go with this guy, this manager guy, New York guy, Allen Klein. And I thought he was robbing us. And the others didn't. They were very enamored of him. So I had to kind of do all sorts of horrible things, like sue them, was the most fun thing. Because I said to my lawyers, can we sue this Allen Klein bloke? They said, no. He's not a party to any of the agreements. So if you want to sue, if you want to get - 

You got to sue. 

You have got to sue the guys. 

And they said, what did John say, when he found out you were suing him? 

Not exactly pleased. 

Was there a phone call saying, what are you doing? 

No, there wasn't. It had gone beyond phone calls, because there were no phone calls. You just didn't talk to each other for a long time. So it was quite painful. Just trying to save everything we'd ever made to that date. Imagine yourself, everything you've ever earned in broadcasting is in a bank somewhere, and someone is about to take it. You've got to fight pretty hard. 

But you've been savvy about it. People, true or not, you have an extraordinary sense of business, and a willingness to fight for what you think is fair? 

Well, I don't know about that. I've got really great people. 

What about the Capitol deal? You went in and bought up some of those things, and that created a little bit of ill-will, didn't it? 

Yeah, oh yeah. It does happen, and stuff. Yeah, it's very difficult. If you've got three hours, we could talk about it. 

I've got three hours, you don't. That's your problem. 

I haven't got three, but if you want to talk about it, what happened was, after The Beatles had broken up, I said to everyone, well, let's just go our ways, then. Let's not get crazy. After the first year, they held on - we held on to each other's contracts. It's like, we're not letting you go. I said, well, we're breaking, as a group. You've got to let me go, and let me go somewhere. They said no, you're still on our label. So it was this terrible feeling, and we were still recording. So in the end, I went over to Capitol, and it actually was me, it was my lawyers - my father in law and my brother-in-law, John and Lee Eastman. Went to Capitol, and they said, okay, we're going to give you a big six-record deal, solo, Paul, it's all going to be marvelous and stuff. And Capitol said, what you want for it? And they said, we don't want cash. But we notice you've got certain rights in there, that are yours, and have nothing to do - it's not The Beatles' end of it. I think the misconceptions, people, when they didn't like what I did, they felt that I was nicking some of The Beatles' stuff. 

Capitol didn't take what The Beatles owned and gave it you, Capitol took what they owned and gave it to you, because you were bargaining. 

If you do a record contract, they keep a big bit, and give you a little bit. We had the little bit. So my lawyers said, well give us a bit more of that big bit, that's yours. They could have asked for a bit of the Beach Boys. That wouldn't have been sensible. So anyway, they did that. And later, I happened to mention to the guys that I had done this, and they really hit the roof. I can see why, because it looked like - 

They thought you were - 

Well, also, we'd been so equal as The Beatles. It was really a four-way split everywhere down the line. But I pointed out to them, we're no longer The Beatles. We've just split up. You know, this is what a split-up is. We now go our own ways. So if I said I get a deal. But anyway, it hurt them, and I can see why. But we equalized it up later. We did a thing where we all sat down, so they now have exactly what I got. So in fact, I helped them, really. 

Yeah. John never had another songwriter, other than you, right? Did he ever write with anyone? 

Yoko. 

Yoko, okay. But other than Yoko? You were the only. 

I think, yeah. Possibly. I'm not sure if that's true. It's near enough true. 

The only person he chose to - 

Where were you when he died? 

I was at home. In England. Very early in the morning, and someone from my office rang me, and told me. I was alone in the house, so it was kind of - shattering news. I mean, it was the most shattering news. You sort of know your parents are going to die. When they die, that's shattering, but you kind of know. When you're a little kid, you say, daddy, you'll die one day. And it's a thing you always live with. Your mates, you don't - you think they'll live as long as you do. And we'll all go to great old age. So John's thing was particularly shattering. And Linda had taken the kids to school, so I had to wait for her to get back, and she sort of got out of the car and I - John's dead. I don't know. We just sort of went indoors and just sort of sat around a lot, you know. And then we all went to work. All of us. George, and all in our different things. We all chose to go into work that day, which is sort of strange. I don't think we could have coped sitting around the house thinking about it all day. So we just all went into work and thought about it all day, at work. But at least there were people around, there were people who you could have a cup of tea. It was very, very difficult. But those things, they're so sort of shattering. Because I think the guy who did it is the jerk of all jerks. That was a phrase came to me that day, as I was sitting there crying. Jerk of all jerks. This guy now qualifies. He's now - but there's nothing to be done about it. It's happened. So frightening and scary and stuff. But there you go. 

Is some of that reflected in this oratorio? Some of those feelings, some of that? 

I think you know, as you grow up, these things happen to you. We talked about the death of your parents and stuff. As you get older, you know more people who have died. 

Yeah, yeah. 

And I think your emotional well gets more full. You're more used to cried. I mean, when I was a little kid I cried a lot, but then there came a point where I stopped crying, because I'm a man now. Now, I don't care. If I'm about to cry, I cry. 

You just cry? 

Not right now. 

There was a period after that. Did you move away from The Beatles in a sense, because the most recent tour, you did a lot of the old songs, more. It was almost a sense of you coming back too - the audience has always wanted you to be there. They never would let you go. But you seem to be saying, let me do these other things. 

It wasn't just me. All of us did that. It was a kind of reaction we all had. George made an album called All Things Must Pass, which was a big successful thing. When he toured, he didn't do any Beatles stuff. John, when he did concerts, it was all Instant Karma, stuff with Yoko. We all left all The Beatles stuff alone, because it reminded us of the pain of the divorce kind of thing. And also, obviously, the other question in all of our minds was, is there life after The Beatles? Or do we have to be Beatles all our lives? And at that particular point, it was painful to admit, you have to be Beatles all your lives. You are Charlie Chaplin, and we know you are. 

And don't ever do anything but what Charlie Chaplin would do. 

Do the funny walk, Charlie. We don't want to see all of that limelight clever stuff. 

Yes. Don't take any chances with us. 

Funny moustache and the funny walk and the cane, or we won't like you. So we fought with that for a number of years, and each of us - 

And the Stones did too, didn't they? The Rolling Stones? 

They, in what way? 

Didn't they have the same problem, when they would try to break away from all the old stuff? 

Well, they could never do new material. That's always a problem, though. That's something else. I don't think that's the same. It's a different thing. People don't want to hear new material, you've got to sort of beg to play it. 

And was it a struggle though, for you? Because you were living with this notion they always wanted you to be The Beatles, they just wanted you to be The Beatles? 

It was pretty difficult, but I really, I just decided to start back at square one, get a group, and I either had to decide I was quitting music, or I had to work after The Beatles. And my mind, which is - sometimes people think I'm pretty conniving. It's actually - it's quite simple in my mind. I just thought, well, I'll get another group then, and I'll get out there. And that's exactly what we did. 

Is it that easy, though? I mean, people do - 

It's not easy. 

But I mean, but did you just sort of say it that way? Look, I've got to do something. 

I'll tell you exactly what I said. I said, hey, Lin, Johnny Cash has got a group. 

You didn't say that. 

Why don't we get a group? 

No, come on. Was that the way it was? 

Exactly what it was. Yeah. I said, then, very innocently, when you think what followed, I said to Linda, do you want to be in it? 

And that's how it started. 

And that's how it started. And later they said, he shouldn't have his old lady up on stage, what's she doing there? And all that stuff. 

And so what did you say to that? 

I said, she's my mate. I'd like to have her here, please. 

Because you just want her presence there? 

Yeah. Basically what it is. 

That's it. You want her near you. 

It still is basically that, yeah. You do it for that reason. You see, when you're a young group starting in the business, you can do anything you want. You can have your wife on stage, you can have your mother on stage if you want. Nobody minds, because nobody's got any preconceived ideas of what you do. If you have the dogs, all the dogs, it's this marvelous act. I take my mother, my wife, fantastic. How innovative. 

Yeah. 

Well, you can do that, but once you establish yourself as The Beatles, or as - then you try and break that mold, that is more difficult. But I just decided, it's my life, it's not their life. They may not like it, but we'll muddle through. And we did. We did very well, actually. 

Wings did very well? 

Yeah. Wings. In Wings, we always thought we were failing, because we just, we always matched everything to The Beatles, we just held up and said - 

We being just you, or the group? 

The group. Everything we ever did always was done in the shadow of The Beatles, because The Beatles had done this bigger than us, they had done that. They were better, they sang better, and the guitar player was better, the drummer was better. But we had to just live with that, and say, yeah, well okay. That's true, maybe. The Beatles are certainly a hard act to follow, but follow it I will. 

Why was - what is it about The Beatles? You must have thought about it. 

Great group. 

Great group. 

They were a very special group. The chemistry was very special. 

The time was right? 

More than that, though. I mean, we were different from other groups. I hate to say this, but we were slightly cleverer at the time than most groups. John had been to an art college, which, the Stones did the same, Jagger and Richard. Slightly cleverer than the average bears you'd find in groups. It was a bit that. In fact, we used to have jokes with that, with the other groups. We'd pretend to be more intellectual than we were. I remember being backstage in Hamburg once, and a girlfriend of mine sent me a Yevtushenko, I think it was. 

Poetry, yes. 

And I didn't really know about this, but we were sitting around. And a sax player knocked, from one of the other groups, he knocked on the door, and when he came in, we were all sort of - and I was reading. The flower, the blossom. I can't remember it. And he crept through, put his sax down. He thought we were having a poetry reading. And when he went out the room, we fell about. We were always doing that. And I do think that showed. We came to America, people said, don't mention the Vietnam War, whatever you do. They're very touchy. 

Those Americans. 

Those Americans. At this moment, you will not endear yourself to anyone if you say - and it's the first question. What do you think of the Vietnam War? It's a bad war. And you know, we were always willing to do that. I mean, you see what John became. 

The peace activist he became? 

You know, I think you've got to be a little bit intelligent to do some of the stuff he did. John was a pretty good writer, too. So. 

Why did he - 

I mean prose writer, rather than songwriting. 

Why did he want out? 

I think John didn't like to be trapped by anything. I think all of us, the male menopause, I think, is about a feeling of being trapped. I used to go out with girls, I used to go to clubs, and now I sit at home. There's a feeling of that. I notice a lot of my friends get that. 

Midlife crisis. 

Middle age crisis kind of thing. And I think with John, he loved - in fact, when The Beatles broke up, he likened it to his first divorce. He said, I feel great. I feel so energized. It's just like when I told my wife I was getting divorced. It was such a weight. I felt like free. It was like a butterfly let out of a jar, you know. And I think John had a huge feeling of that. Of course, with Yoko, my feeling was, he had to clear the decks, too. Because if you used to work with Yoko, you couldn't have these sort of Beatle-like appendages. 

Yeah. Because - 

Because he had to give his life to Yoko. This was the nature of the relationship. 

Nature of her demand, do you think? 

No. No, his demand. Don't - people get that wrong, you know. John was hopelessly in love with Yoko. 

I've interviewed her, and had long conversations. And I believe that, that he - people I talk to say he, don't suggest that he didn't love her and didn't control his own life and didn't know what he was doing, is to underestimate and insult John. 

Exactly. 

That he would somehow - 

John did nothing he didn't want to do. John only did what he wanted to do. He was a very smart guy. And you know, you could see at that point in his life, he'd had a marriage which had been okay for a while, but was getting a little bit pipe and slippers. 

Right, right. 

Because I knew his wife, Cynthia, you know. And she did. She wanted a husband who would just come home and be a nice husband. Like wives, I don't want to belittle wives, but it often is a thing that you want your husband to do, you know. Just behave, kind of thing. But John was more restless. So when he met Yoko, it kind of just blew the gaff wide open. 

You've talked about this a thousand, but just want to, just, in the context of this conversation, did the two of you ever talk about the getting back together? What's the myth and the reality of that? 

Nearest it ever came was, Saturday Night Live did, as a spoof, they made an offer, and Lorne Michaels, who was producing it, I know quite well now. He went to the accounts department of NBC, and he said, I can The Beatles reunion. So they said, what would you pay? And the guy said, well the standard fee for a live act is so-and-so, and it was like $24.34. So they used it as a skit. And they said, if you're out there, Beatles, come on. NBC's offering $24 - and John and I happened to be in his house in The Dakota, while this was going on. And we said, come on. Should we go? It's just down the road. And for half a second, we nearly went. 

Wow. 

But that was like as near as it got. Money wasn't good enough. 

Money? 

$24.34. 

Right. I thank you for doing this. It's a pleasure. I could on and on and on. I want to mention, are you going to do another tour? 

I am going to go on one. You're leaving? 

There may be some more Little Richards out there, that are waiting for their credit, too. Liverpool Oratorio premieres on Great Performance Wednesday, October 30, 1991. 8:30 to 11:00. Boy, you have got some big-name talent here, too, singing. 

Yeah. Well, I tried to get the best people. I just asked, said who's the best? And then we saw if they were available. 

And if they wanted to do it. 

These are some of the best people. 

And this was all - 

The only thing is we had to get a very English-speaker tenor. I said, who are the best tenors, and Pavarotti's name came up, and Domingo Carreras. But because it's a story of, so it was, I was born in Liverpool, we figured we couldn't have it, because it would be and so it was. So we can't have - so we got Jerry Hadley. 

An Italian Liverpool. 

So we got Jerry to do it, and he's perfect. He was great. 

And it was taped, actually, what, June 28, or something like that? In the Cathedral there with a boys choir, and - PAUL MCCARTNEY The cathedral, which is the largest in Europe outside St. Peters, which I never knew. My hometown church turns out to be this great big thing. With the chorus, with the whole orchestra, the boys - You didn't write in a part for yourself, either? 

No, I didn't. On purpose, though. 

Why? 

I like the idea. I'd been asked to do this as a composer. Now, the trouble with me as a performer is the natural first question, even Carl said to me, are you going to be in it? And Kiri, when we came to do it, she still says I should do the part of the Headmaster. Boys, this is your teacher. I said, no, no, no. It's the baritone's part. And if you do this stuff, you've got, it's a whole other thing. Another ballgame. Plus, I get to be in the audience. 

Ah, yes. 

Weren't they good? I loved it. Author! It's great. It's a big change for me. It's a night out for me, now. And we're doing it at Carnegie - well, they're doing it, rather, at Carnegie Hall. 

And there's a documentary that goes with it, too? 

The documentary on 

Yeah. 

And that's a thing that a girl from the BBC made. It's quite interesting. Shows how we got it all together. 

There's never been, the ultimate documentary has never been made. What is it? That you wanted? 

Of what? 

Of The Beatles. 

No. I suppose that's true. 

Yeah. But I thought there was some discussion of that at one time. 

Yeah, we had - 

Along the line of -- of problems, so it always was on the back burner. But now that we've solved our problems, we're thinking of doing a film called The Long Winding Road. Yeah, which has been talked about for a while. 

Well, there's a producer, there's a director sort of engaged, now, so it's really looking like it's going to happen. 

Would you want to do this again? 

Oratorio? 

Yeah. 

Absolutely. 

More classical music from McCartney? 

Definitely. I really enjoyed every stage along the way. Carl, who I was working with, he said, look, that was the easy bit. Doing the nice songs, and doing that. He said, now it gets difficult. We've got to orchestrate it. Yes, but I've done a bit of this. I've done. But I also know a bit about orchestration. I don't know it theoretically, but I can hear if that's enough cellos, or if it should be one, or if it should be ten, and that's really what's involved. So I sat with him every inch of the way. Some people think his bits are the orchestral bits and my bits are the song bits. 

Not true? 

But I sat with him every inch of the way. It became a joke, in the end. He said, don't worry, Paul. I haven't changed anything. But it was very enjoyable. 

And did you feel, at the end of this, my god, old McCartney went out and took a giant step and it worked, and I'm pretty proud of the guy? 

Yes. I must say, without being too conceited, the album went to number one, and came in at number one on the classical charts in England yesterday. So I can now safely say, we did it. It was a great thing to do. I was very proud, because it was Liverpool. People come up to me, say, oh, this is good. We're really proud of you. And that was great. That was great. Just to be in your hometown and have people come up and say we're proud of you. That's a great word to hear. 

I don't know the answer to this. Are your mom and dad alive? 

No. 

No, family there, at all? 

A lot of family, yeah. Lots of family. 

Did they show up in the cathedral? 

They're described in the newspaper as two pimply-faced youths and an amply-bosomed women. Well, they wrote a letter the next week. 

Did they, to the editor? 

Damn right, they did. How dare you describe Auntie Joan as this. But no, it was great. It was a really great event. And making the piece was such great fun, that I definitely would like to do it again. And some people have said to me, does this mean you're done with rock 'n roll and you're now going to go classical? I love the balance. 

One feeds the other, maybe. 

Yeah, it does. It does. I'm at the moment writing the sort of next, what do you want to call it, pop album. And it's exciting to get back to a bit of guitar, a bit of loud guitar, after the classical stuff. 

Does it have a title? 

No. 

And you'll be on tour next year, maybe? 

Yeah, I think, if all being well. 

Around the world? 

I'll go on tour again. 

Thank you. Pleasure. 

You're welcome. 

Very much. Paul McCartney. I've done some 10,000 interviews over the last, say ten years, and this is one of my favorite. Paul McCartney, because he takes the question, and he goes with it. And I didn't know whether he wanted to talk about certain things, but he did, and it made an engaging time for me, and I hope we can do it again, and I hope you enjoyed it. Tomorrow, join me for a conversation with Broadway's Rosemary Harris. We'll also have a discussion on Haiti and its future with refugee Bobby Duvall, and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, a fun informative look at what's on the big screen with some of New York's leading film critics. All of that coming up tomorrow. As we go, we'll have credits over a clip, from a new film about Paul McCartney's last tour, which is at theaters around the country, called Get Back. Thank you for joining us, for the conversation with Paul McCartney. I'll see you tomorrow night.
