Alyssa Mastromonaco is here. She is president of global communications at A&E Networks. Prior to this, she was President Obama's director of campaign operations, and later his deputy chief of staff. She was one of the president's longest serving advisors. She was often referred to as one of the most important people in government that you haven't heard of. She has just written a memoir about her time in government. It is called, "Who Thought This Was a Good Idea? And Other Questions You Should Have Answers To When You Work At the White House". And it has just reached number ten on the "New York Times" best-seller list. I am pleased to have Alyssa Mastromonaco back at this table. So really, tell me why you wrote the book. 

So, I wrote the book because I think that there is a sort of preponderance of memoirs out from the White House, and out of government that are really very serious and dense and don't necessarily give young people, especially young women, a path to government or to see themselves in government. Deana Perino actually did a book, but other than that, there aren't that many. And so, I wanted to write something that made the government and the White House seem accessible. 

And a place that you could go and work and feel good about it. 

Yes, and still just be a normal person. You don't have to be Wonder Woman. (LAUGHTER) 

Well, you were Wonder Woman, weren't you? 

I mean, I was, but I had my share of problems. (LAUGHTER) 

How did you meet Barack Obama? 

I met Barack Obama in December of 2004. Robert Gibbs had worked for him on his senate race. I had just lost -- I worked on the Kerry campaign which had just lost. And Robert Gibbs sent me an AOL instant message that said, how are you? Do you need work? And I said I did. And so, that was -- that was, I met with then Barack Obama. 

Senator Obama. 

Senator Obama two weeks later. 

Yes. And so what job did you get? 

So I was sort of an advisor, and I did his schedule and his political work before I went over eventually to become the political director of the political action committee. 

Political director of the political action committee. 

Yes. 

How would you define the relationship between the two of you? 

We are sort of like big brother, not much younger sister. (LAUGHTER) That's what he would say. 

That's what he would say. 

I'm not that much younger. 

Yes. He also took an interest in your dating life, did he? 

He did. I think that he saw how hard we all worked, and that we were there sort of supporting him, so he felt really responsible for making sure we had personal lives. So he did try to set me up on a date or two. 

Do you think he's going to end up spending a lot of time the rest of his life as a writer. 

It seems to be, it seemed to me, the thing that he deeply enjoyed doing, that he really invested his time, that he really sort of got into. 

What -- he also had speechwriters. 

He did. 

So how did that work out? 

So, I think that there are so many things to be written in the White House, and on a campaign, you know, a campaign, you're doing three events a day. In the White House you're doing at least one event a day. So, you know, Jon Favreau, especially, and Cody Keenan, who were his speechwriters, his chiefs of speechwriting, they had such a sort of mind meld with him that they could talk to him and know where he wanted to go, and then he would take it, and it would be a back and forth and just a really good partnership. 

There were some that he wrote really himself like during the speech on religion during the campaign. 

Yes, the race speech. And then -- yes, there were some that were just so personal to him, his remarks at Newtown, at the memorial at Newtown after the shooting, things like that he just felt he had to do himself. 

He said that was the worst day of his presidency. 

Yes, I'd say we would all say that was the worst day that you ever could have been in government. 

Because so many young innocent people died. 

I mean it was a tragedy beyond description. 

This country still has not changed on gun control, has it? 

No, it hasn't. And you have to wonder why. 

Why? 

I think that the Republicans are afraid to stand up to the NRA. And I think that a lot of what the Democrats proposed, especially right after Newtown, was pretty basic. You know, background checks, closing the loophole in the gun show, you know, the gun show loophole. Seems pretty simple, but I don't know. They just still seem really resistant to it. 

So give us the sense of being inside the White House. When did you go to work? 

Oh, I would -- so in the very beginning, I have to be quite honest with you, in the beginning you probably get there around 6:30, 6:45, and you have your first meeting at 7:30, then with Rahm Emmanuel who was chief of staff. 

Yes. 

I will say though that by the end, you would sort of like screech into your parking spot on West Executive by like 7:25, and you'd have your cup of coffee waiting and you just go in. 

And then a meeting early in the morning and -- 

Meetings early in the morning. And you would meet with your -- my director reports, you know, to just check in every day, and then we would have a series of meetings in the afternoon. Sometimes we would be traveling which always made the meeting schedule more dense on the days you weren't. 

What did you learn about how to make an institution run? About how to make people believe in the mission? 

I think that, you know, at the very core of our group, you know, we just deeply believed in Barack Obama and were aligned behind why he wanted to be president, which was to really help the American people. And so, when we got there, I think that he was very true to what he said. And so it made it easy to get everybody in line to sort of achieve, like to pass health care, to -- passing health care is a great example, but we knew that that was important. Every single one of us in our own way, like I had nothing to do -- I didn't really have anything to do with policy, but I still supported the passing of health care in my own way with my direct reports. And so, yes, I think that we were just not competitive. And we were really supportive of each other and it made it easy. 

And what was it about the death of your cat that the president was concerned about? 

So my beloved cat Shrummy, who was a Katrina rescue, had been with me since I started working with Barack Obama. I got him right after hurricane Katrina. When he passed away, he'd been with us through everything, he went to Chicago, he was part of the family. And when it -- Shrummy got sick, he was sick for quite a while. And he got better. And when he finally passed away, Anita Decker, who took my job after I left, I told her because her dog had just passed away, I said, Shrummy passed away, and I was so upset and I was in the parking lot. And at Vice, we had just had a journalist who -- 

Vice was the place you went to work after? 

Yes, Vice Media. And we had a journalist who had been detained and I thought that the number on the phone was the lawyer calling about that, but it was really the Air Force One operator saying that they missed me up in the sky and that the president wanted to talk to me. And having been with the president when he had to make calls like this, you always feel bad for him. You're like, really, you have to call someone about their cat that died? But I said, I appreciate it. This is really awkward for you, like you can go. And he had just renamed Mount McKinley, Denali, and he told me that they had seen the spirit of Shrummy float up over Denali. It sounds so silly, and it was the first time I really understood deeply like how much it means for him to take five minutes to do something like that, it meant a lot. 

What do you think you know about him that the world doesn't know or hasn't seen, perhaps? 

Maybe they're seeing it a little bit more now, but I think that there was this real idea that he was quite aloof, and that he was like sort of not very emotive. And I know him to be really funny, deeply -- the most intellectually curious person. Like people would think, oh, the president must know everything, the president doesn't think there is anything more to learn, and I would say he is the most intellectually curious person I will ever know. 

And how does he express that? 

He wants to know about everything. There is nothing to -- I could be reading, you know, he could be talking sports with one person. I could be reading, you know, one of my books that is not so far from the book that I wrote, you know, a book basically for young women, but I was reading it at the age of 38. And he would say, no, tell me about it. Tell me what they learned. Oh, maybe, Sasha and Malia would like that book. But, basically anything, science, he loved to learn about science. You know Dan Pfeiffer. Dan Pfeiffer and the president came up with the White House science fair and he always said don't rush me through the science fair, this is one of my favorite days of the year. And he would have all the kids teach him how they made all of their different projects. It was really special. 

Do you think when he walked in the room he thought he was the smartest man in the room? 

No, I don't think so. I think most -- no, I think that -- no, because I had to think about it. I wanted to really think about like meetings in my head. I think sometimes of course he was. But I don't think that he walked in to meetings with like Chancellor Merkel and was like I'm smarter than you. And so I think that he had a good sense of his position. 

Yes. What did you not do that you wish you had done? 

I wish that I had -- in the moment I wish I had appreciated it more. It is so busy. Yes, it's so busy that every day, it's like -- 

You don't think at the moment how, this is fabulous, this is wonderful, I need to drink deeply of this? 

Sometimes you do. Sometimes you're moving so fast, there were times, when I met the Pope -- 

How was that? 

That was incredible. He was, you know, how many people get an audience with the Pope. I guess some people. But, no, but the last day it was like -- the last day when I left the White House, it was like the movie playing in my head. I turned up Led Zeppelin really loudly and I drove out the gates on to Pennsylvania Avenue, which you only get to really do once in a while. And they let me drive out. And I thought to myself, like this is -- I will never be back here in the same way ever again. And probably never -- I don't know that I would ever work in the White House ever again. It was a special -- 

Yes, but you have subsequently said you could imagine yourself getting back in the game. 

I could. 

And supporting a presidential candidate. 

I think that, you know, when Secretary Clinton was running, I was really hopeful that she would win. And I think that, you know, for some of us, myself especially, I was glad to just sort of back up into the shadows and say, you know, and take my bow and say it has been a great run. But with the new administration, I think that if someone thought -- if someone was going to run in 2020, I think that if I could really be of help to them, it would be hard for me to say no. 

So what do you think of the Trump administration? 

You know, one of the things that President Obama always felt was, you know, there are moments to be partisan and there are moments when you have to be the public servant and not the politician. And so for me, we were so, we were so -- the Bush administration was so helpful to us. They couldn't have been more generous. And they prepared us so well for what was coming during our period of transition, that, you know, when I saw the president come out and say that we would sport Donald Trump, this was, you know, going to be a peaceful transition. I said OK, I'm in. I'm going to do it. And the thing that hurts me so much is that I feel deeply like they have not looked at what we did and evaluated it with clear eyes and thought, oh maybe this is actually pretty good and we should keep it or maybe we'll tweak this a bit. It seems as if they're just skeet shooting everything that we did for sport. 

Like today, you know, environmental standards. 

Right. I mean, how could -- 

It must make you break your heart -- 

It does. 

-- to think that you worked eight years to build something, you know, and somebody comes in and says we're going to tear this down. 

Just for the sake of tearing it down. I get politics, you know, there's always a winner, there's always a loser, you get that. But you know, the thing that I thought was just pretty grotesque, for lack of a better word, was that they wanted to have that vote to repeal the ACA on the day that -- on the seven year anniversary of the president signing it. That's not -- that's a whole other level to me of, sort of political theater. 

You guys worked really hard. That was a single legislative achievement. 

We did. 

Of eight years in government. 

Yes. And millions of people, tens of millions of people were helped by it. And to vote on something when you can't explain how people who have health care will be taken care of, it just seemed so rushed and haphazard, which is hard because we -- if nothing, people can criticize us anyway they want to, but we were thoughtful. 

To understand what this book is about, it's a chronicle of your experiences. But it also is a sense of communication to young people. 

Yes. And the thing that I wanted to sort of also show is that I think that, you know, public service and politics get so conflated sometimes. You actually can go be a public servant. You don't have to be super partisan. You can serve your country. It doesn't even matter who the president is, you know, in so many cases. So, I wanted the -- I wanted young people, but especially women, to know that it was an available option and one that they should consider. 

"Who Thought This Was A Good Idea?" Alyssa Mastromonaco, who had an inside view of government, of the White House, of presidential power and of all the stakes that come to you when you occupy Pennsylvania Avenue. Interesting book. Number 10 now on "The New York Times" best-seller list. Congratulations. 

Thank you, Charlie.
