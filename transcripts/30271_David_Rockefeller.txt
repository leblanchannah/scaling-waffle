David Rockefeller died Monday morning. He was 101 years old. The banker who became a public figure was the youngest grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil. David Rockefeller led Chase Manhattan Bank for more than a decade. He expanded the bank's operation globally and cultivated close relationships with foreign leaders. He was also a renowned art collector and philanthropist. In a statement, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, "No individual has contributed more to the commercial and civic life of New York City over a longer period of time than David Rockefeller." Mike Bloomberg once said to me that if his father knew he was a friend of David Rockefeller's, nothing would have made him more proud. I could say the same thing. You are looking now at a photograph taken at the Bush home in Kennebunkport, Maine. I'd been invited to the Bush's for lunch and knew David was in Maine, so I called President Bush and asked if I might invite David. And then he said, "Of course. I would love to see him." David came by helicopter. I came up by Delta and we all had a wonderful afternoon. He was a wonderful man, a wonderful friend and he lived an extraordinary life. In his later years, he made it a point of showing his grandchildren and great grandchildren around the world. I had the great joy of his friendship and celebrated his 100th birthday with him and many of his close friends. He appeared on this program many times. Here is a look at some of those conversations. Do you represent in some way the end of an era when you think of the family and you think of dispersion and you think of the central role that you have played in the evolution of this family through the tradition I just talked about? 

It certainly is the end of one important period for the family. I like to think, though, that there are lots of oncoming members of the family who are going to make a place for themselves, both in the next generation, my children and nieces and nephews and coming on the fifth and sixth generation, they are really quite remarkable. I don't believe it will be the same, but I think that there are real possibilities that they will make a place for themselves. 

How do you explain, one, the family has been a prominent, b) it has survived and other great American families, but none have maintained such a prominence in American life and to have seemed to have carried such a commitment of payback? 

Well, I think it's largely that we, my siblings and myself, had very good parents. I think mother and father complemented one another in a way that was very much to our benefit and we were brought up to feel responsibility for the fact that we did have more than most people. And father always said, and I think rightly, that for every opportunity goes an obligation. And I think without preaching that in an offensive way, we all felt that responsibility and also, have had great opportunities. 

He imposed a sense of frugality from what I read. 

Yes, he did but I think here's where he married a wonderful person, my mother, who brought perhaps a little more humanity and humor and sense of fun than perhaps father was brought up with. 

Yes. 

And the combination of the two, I think it worked well. 

Her father was a senator from Rhode Island. 

Her father was a senator, Republican Senator from Rhode Island. He was in the senate I think 32 years. 

Do you remember your grandfather? 

Our last -- my Grandfather Rockefeller, yes. 

Yes. 

And he died when I was 21. And I saw a great deal of him. My grand -- unfortunately, my other three grandparents all died within a year of the time I was born. So it's only my Grandfather Rockefeller that I knew. 

And then your dad, who was called junior, carried on the tradition. 

He did indeed with great dedication and I think very effectively. He was a deeply religious person and I think that that had a great impact on his life and what he did. But he also had great imagination and I think he was primarily known as a philanthropist. He was a very creative one. And what he would, a lot of the most creative things that he did, he did because he saw an opportunity on a trip, sometimes with his children. An example being Colonial Williamsburg, which he visited with his three younger children in 1926 and met with Dr. Goodwin and he's visited Williamsburg, which of course had been the capital in the pre-United States days, and then was moved to -- capital moved to Richmond. And Dr. Goodwin persuaded him to take an interest in restoring one building and from that... 

We got a village. 

...he restored Williamsburg. But the same year, we also went to Jackson's Hole and as a result of seeing the area below the Grand Teton Mountains which were being cluttered with sign boards and honky-tonks and whatnot, he bought up that land and gave it to the United States Government as part of the Grand Teton National Park. In other words, I think that he was a creative philanthropist in a very wonderful way. 

Since so much of your life has been at the Chase, what, 55 years? 

Well, 35 I was employed by Chase -- 

But you started at 46. 

Yes, and then for the last 17, I'm still chairman of the International Advisory Committee, and I still go on -- this last trip to China was for the bank and I went with bank people. So, I still do things with them and for them, but I have no responsibility for anything that goes on in the bank. 

When you look back on your tenure there, what -- how do you assess it? 

I think from my perspective, it really was made to order because I'm interested in all the things that I did and that gave me an excuse to do a lot more. And, so a lot of the people I saw were perhaps initially for the bank, Sadat being a good example, because he, in this interview that I mentioned, asked me if we'd open a branch, after Nasser had nationalized all the banks in Egypt. But I got to know him on a personal basis and so there was always a mixture of my specific bank responsibilities with a variety of other interests, cultural and otherwise. 

My question had also to do with the notion of, I mean, you were primarily, because of your interest in international ideas, events, personalities, trends, led the bank in its push to internationalism, correct? 

Yes. 

One of the early banks to do that. 

Citi Bank had done a good deal, but we did a lot of catch up and I think if there is a single thing that I did contribute to Chase, it was to expand our -- I think I visited 107 countries for the Chase while I was -- in the 35 years I was there and we opened branches or representative offices and I think we've had over 70, 75, by the time I left. 

The idea of corporate responsibility, your strong feelings that if you have leadership in the corporate world and the resources of a corporation, you ought to do what with them? 

Well, in the first place, I think the business community and the private sector, in general, correctly felt that government, even in democracies, had gotten too bureaucratic and too big and it was good to cut back on government, which we have done to a considerable degree. I think this is something Ronald Reagan deserves a lot of credit for. But if government is going to get out of a lot of things, somebody has to take their place. And it seems to me that business and the private sector, which pushed for this, has to assume some responsibility. If so, then it means, it seems to me, that the leaders of business and of not-for-profit corporations should recognize that they have a responsibility outside their own businesses to do something for society at large. And therefore, I feel concerned at what's happening in this country at the present time where it seems to me that the stock market analyst, who seemed to have a great influence on a lot of things these days are putting all of their focus on quarterly results and not on long-term achievements of the institution, which I think is dangerous and bad in itself. But, because they're putting so much emphasis on that, it means that they are watching, with a microscope, the activities of CEOs of these corporations and if they spend too much time doing other things, they're very likely to say, "Well, you should be paying more attention to the immediate earnings of your corporation and shouldn't be giving time." I think that's wrong. I think that a well-managed corporation can give time for its chief executives to do other things as well. In fact, I think that's an indication of good leadership that a good manager can delegate, and therefore, can afford to spend time doing things that are important even if they're not directly related to the corporation. 

I can't let this time go without talking about The Museum Of Modern Art. 

Good. 

The place that The Museum Of Modern Art is is your former home. 

Well, that's true in a physical sense. I was born in a house which now is the sculpture garden of the museum. 

Your mother... 

Was one of the... 

...founders. 

...one of the three ladies who founded it. 

Yes. 

And that was very exciting. This was a great passion of hers and I've -- 

It was 1929 at the time... 

1929. 

...that we were at the -- facing economic catastrophe in this country. 

That's right. 

The Great Depression was right around the corner. 

She persuaded father when, a little bit after that, when I graduated from Harvard and moved away, my brothers and sisters all moved away. They didn't need a nine-story house, so they moved to an apartment and that was also the house on the same block that belonged to my grandfather that had never been torn down. So father generously, because he didn't really like modern art very much, but he listened to mother and gave all of that land to the museum, which was a great thing. 

And you just went through a long process to select a new architect to enlarge The Museum Of Modern Art. Were you chair of that group that led that? 

No, but I was involved in it. 

You are one of the five or six that... 

Yes, and this is very exciting because I believe that The Museum Of Modern Art in the 20th Century has played a very important role in identifying the best of what's being done in the 20th Century and has made a collection, which certainly is the best in the world, of 20th Century Art. 

One last question, your legacy, what do you want it to be? 

Well, I feel very proud of the family's traditions and what they've been able to achieve in the world, starting with grandfather and really throughout. I have six wonderful children, all of whom share that kind of concern about a sense of obligation to do something constructive. I would love to feel that when I go, that I've been a part of that tradition, which seems to me to be one that's a good and a happy one for our country. I don't think I could ask for much more than that. 

David Rockefeller, dead at 101.
