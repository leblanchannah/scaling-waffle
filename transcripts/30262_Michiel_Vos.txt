European elections and Jesca Hoop when we continue. Good evening, I'm Dan Senor filling in for Charlie Rose. Just this week, Dutch voters went to the polls to vote in what analysts typically characterize as one of the least exciting elections in the European calendar. But the vote mattered this year because of the wave of populism that is upending politics throughout the West. The Dutch vote is the first of a trio of elections, followed next month by France, and then Germany. That will tell us a lot about the future of Europe. Tonight we talk about what happened in this vote and what the future holds for political leaders, ranging from Angela Merkel to Marine La Pen. Joining me here in New York is Michiel Vos. He's a U.S. correspondent for several Dutch and Belgian networks, including RTL, and Nell Breyer, she's executive director of the Marshall Scholars Association. And from Washington, D.C. is Walter Russell Mead, who is professor of Foreign Policy at Bard College and a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute. I'm pleased to welcome you all to this program. Michiel let me start with you. You covered this election in The Netherlands closely. There was a lot of focus on it. Everyone thought it was going to tell us a lot about the future of Europe. Why was everybody so focused on this election and one particular rising there star there, Geert Wilders? 

Geert Wilders, yes. It was all about him, because that's why I think the whole world, so to speak, looked at this, because it was he who said, you know, enough with Europe, enough with the Muslims, enough with immigration. We got to stop this. We got to ban the Koran. We got to close the mosques in The Netherlands. We've got to prevent kids from eating halal foods in schools. Stop. I want to give -- this sounds familiar maybe -- I want to give Holland back to the Dutch. And we all know that means. 

Was it some of the most strident anti-Muslim rhetoric we've heard in Europe. 

He is one of the most strident anti-Muslim out there. He's one of the most, like, open, like, he says it like it is. That's why he gets votes. He says is, what we think, people say, you know, he says, we want that guy. 

And he was getting traction leading up to the election. 

And he was getting traction. He's been getting traction. For a long time, he's getting traction. Of course we have this whole issue, shall we say, with immigration. We have an issue with security in Europe. So he did well, but he didn't do good enough, because a lot of people, whenever you go to Holland, and I went a lot of time it is last few weeks, months, to explain Donald Trump, and they always say, "So how is that whole populism thing working out for you in America?" People look at that. I think Americans sort of forget how crazy it looks, America, from Europe. We're like, it's a total Kim Kardashianization of American politics has happened. The Dutch voters looked at that, partly, this is part of the explanation, they looked at that and they thought this is too much. We don't want this. I think that Donald Trump as a populist example, so to speak, for Geert Wilders to follow, sold very well as a candidate leading up to the election. What he says, we want that too. Geert Wilders is our guy. But now that it has to actually function it doesn't sell as well. And I think people looked at that for the last six weeks and they think, hmm, maybe not. 

But the incumbent, Mark Rutte, he actually ran a pretty clever campaign, it seems, to manage this populism. 

Correct. Because, of course, all parties, most parties, most major parties, like, Mark Rutte, you know, the sitting Prime Minister, had to move a little to the right because, you know, to catch some wind. Out of that anti-immigrant rhetoric of Geert Wilders, they had to move to the right. And they did. They nudged themselves to the right, and they said things like, we have to be firm on the borders. We have to get Brussels under control. All these things. And then out of the high hat, of course, came this whole Erdogan, President Erdogan decided -- 

Erdogan in Turkey. 

In Turkey, decided over sort of a diplomatic spat over whether Turkish ministers could speak in Holland for Turkish Dutch nationals, yes or no. We said, the Dutch said, no, you cannot speak in front of those people. We sent them out. We literally escorted them out. 

So there was some referendum in Turkey that would strengthen the Turkish President's powers. 

Yes. 

And he wanted to rev up the Turkish diaspora in other European countries, so he sends the foreign minister to the Netherlands. 

Yes. 

And this quote, unquote, moderate incumbent prime minister who is supposed to be on his back heels politically, basically says you're not welcome. 

Basically. And that's very un-Dutch because Dutchies are always like, you know, we're the tolerant people. We say, "Oh, you come in and you can talk to your people," and it's fine. This time he said no. We're going to protect our borders, he said, for the first time -- many people told me today -- for the first time. He put his back into it and he said, no, I'm not going to let you speak to your Dutch Turkish nationals here in my -- The Netherlands. I'm going to send you out. Then he sent -- they sent -- Turkey sent a second minister. We also denied her access. That led to a huge spat in which Erdogan made, I think, the foolish mistake to call us Nazi remnants. You know, what's happening in Holland, Nazi remnants, fascists, this is not allowed, you know. And then of course, all of Europe suddenly came to the aid -- to the help of this lonely prime minister who took it on for the Dutchies to say, you know what, if you want to speak here in my country, you have play by our rules. You can't just come in and sort of stonewall you way to your referendum. Those are my rules. And that led to -- I think, also gave him the platform to be prime minister, to be, you would say in America, statesman like, and he did it. 

But also to be populist. 

To be populist, of course. 

And tough on security. 

Tough on security. 

The nationalists. 

Everything that Geert Wilders has been saying with a little bit more edge and a little bit more nastiness, he was able to say these things in the last week, and, of course, that matters. It always matters, in the last week it matters. And he was able to be the statesman, and people said, you know what, he can do it. 

So he wins the election. So, Walter, if you are -- today, if you are Angela Merkel or you are Macron in France and you're trying to navigate your own elections in Germany and France, respectively, over the next few months, you look at the outcome in The Netherlands and think what? 

Well you think different things, depending on whether you're in Germany or France. The situations are very different. But I think you -- you know, I think the takeaway here from the Netherlands for Europe is that, you know, the good news is the populist lost, but the bad news is the establishment still has really no idea what to do. And, you know, this is -- for Macron in France, the problem is what's French policy going to be? How do you make the French economy grow? How do you deal with the French problems with immigrants? For Merkel it's how do you -- you know, Germany has been doing fine with the Euro the way it is, but Italy, Spain, Greece, even France, their economies are still suffering as a result of the crisis. So, you know, the populists have failed to shake Europe, but Europe hasn't stopped getting sicker. I think that's what Merkel and Macron probably are really worried about. 

And to be clear here, Wilders ran part of platform that he was going to get the Netherlands out of the EU. 

Yes. 

So it would have been the next domino to fall in the European project. So I want to talk specifically about a couple of these leaders in these countries. So the new leader in Germany, who is posing the biggest threat to Merkel is Schulz, the leader of the socialists, what they call the SEP, the left of center party in Germany, he was President of the European Union. He has been a product of Brussels for, like, a couple of decades. So, Walter, how does he then become the challenge to the pro-led Merkel status quo? 

Well, first of all, in Germany the EU is actually much more popular than it is in a lot of rest of Europe, and so is the Euro. You know, the Euro has actually worked extremely well for Germany, in that Germany has a big export surplus. If it had its own currency the Mark would go sky high, and then it would be much harder for Germany to export. As it is, Germany has a huge export surplus, and the problems of the other European countries keep the Euro down. So right now the status quo in Europe is working for Germany, and for a few other countries. So it's not all that surprising that in Germany you're seeing something more like a traditional European election between a center left candidate, Schulz, and a center right candidate, Merkel. 

But on the security issue do you think there's anything they saw in the Dutch election that has changed anybody's political calculus in Germany, in terms of how to handle the migrant issue, potential terrorist threats from -- you know, perceived terrorist threats that come from the migrants, you know, the numbers of -- 

People coming in. 

Yeah, people coming in, the Muslim population growing. Is there anything there where the candidates differ, where Merkel may differ from Martin Schulz or where Merkel may now do things differently as a result of what she's seen in the Dutch elections? 

Again, you know, the shift in Erdogan from being, you know, what many saw as a hope for the first real Islamist democratic leader in the world to someone who looks increasingly like an authoritarian, but an avowed enemy of Europe, that has shifted the calculation for a lot of people. And at the same time, both Schulz and Merkel understand that the only thing keeping new waves of Syrian and other refugees out of the EU is this agreement that the EU has made with Merkel -- sorry, with Erdogan; that, you know, Turkey is essentially holding immigrants back from Europe. Erdogan knows this. Erdogan knows that in the -- you know, the run up to elections in Germany, or at any point, he can sort of allow that wave to come back in and create a massive political crisis in Germany. So I think everybody in Germany is focused on that issue. Meanwhile, by the way, let's not forget that in Germany, unlike in The Netherlands, people also worry a good deal about Russia. And so in Germany you're looking at two serious security threats, challenges to European, order with not a lot of clarity I think at this point on how do you deal with them. 

Okay. But just picking up on Walter's point, how big a factor is the Russian, quote, unquote, threat to Europe in all of this? How much are these European leaders deeply concerned about where Russia fits in? 

I think they are deeply concerned. I think that -- I think we have all been paying attention over the last year to Russia's role, both in, potentially, destabilizing what we've seen as democracies and a coherent international order in the Western Hemisphere. I think there isn't a politician out there that isn't somewhat amazed by the resurgence of power from that country. And I think that the UN is -- I think there's all kinds of discussion about how that is unfolding. 

And Russia meddling in some of these elections in Europe? 

I think the presence of Russia, and on all levels. And I think whether we're talking about cybersecurity. 

Right. 

Whether you're talking about -- 

Overt, covert, everything. 

Exactly. I think that the real question that was raised here is we're at an inflection point, and I've been thinking with these Marshall Plan who've benefited from this special relationship between the UK and the U.S. Seventy years after the Marshall Plan, what is the international order today? We've had 70 years of peace and stability based on an important gesture that the United States made to many countries in Europe -- The Netherlands, Germany, the UK, many others -- establishing the rule of law, democracy, establishing encouragement of liberal trade policies and the institutions or organizations like the UN and like NATO that help resolve disputes. And the question is, do those still work together? And we're hearing and feeling, with Brexit, with Trump, with questioning around the effectiveness of the European Union, it may not be a perfect fit, but there are values underpinning that we still think are important. That's the question. 

So on Brexit specifically, what is the current -- just talk to us a little bit about the current state of play. Because there's been action in week in Parliament. 

Yeah. Yeah. I think everyone is fully expecting that Article 50 will -- 

Be executed. 

Be executed, absolutely. And then there is a two-year fixed timeline and a lot of trade negotiation and agreements. 

But Parliament voted this week to launch. 

Move forward. Move forward. 

So this is happening. 

It is. There is -- 

No, there is quiet movement about whether or not Brexit be slowed down. I'm dubious about it. But to be clear, this is happening? 

It is happening. And the present government is fully behind it. The question is how, and the question is, is there a way to keep Europe strong? I think this whole Great Britain, Britain is great movement, the idea of having close relationships with all these countries, and with the United States, is actually paramount. And the United Kingdom is certainly made that politically clear. I want to come back to you in one second, Michiel. Walter, just one question just following from what Nell said. So Nell made an eloquent case for the importance of preserving these institutions. Explain to us why -- not that you have this view, although you might -- but explain to us why there is this incredible resonance right now across Europe -- even if Geert Wilders lost, it is clear that the gravity beneath the feet of politics in The Netherlands, and elsewhere, has shifted. Make the case, if you can -- I know it's not necessarily your view, but make the case for why the shift is a reasonable rational response to all these forces? 

Well I wouldn't respond to it in quite the way the populists do, but I do think there are some big things that they see that do push toward change. Maybe the most important is that after World War II we established a stable transatlantic international order. Within each country we established a stable economic order. You know, I call this sometimes the blue model, but you had corporate oligarchies in all these different countries with, you know, lifetime employment based on mass manufacturing employment, mass clerical employment. If you didn't do something wrong, you kept your nose clean, you'd get a job when you came out of school, and you would keep that job and get raises until you retired in a pretty secure retirement. Not everybody, but most people. People really liked that system. And we saw an end to a hundred years of class conflict and of international conflict in Europe, because we found a way for the economy to kind of keep people happy in their daily lives. In the last few years, last 15, 20 years, that system has begun to break up for all kinds of reasons; globalization, automation, just a variety of things are happening, and so people feel less secure in their daily lives. They sense that political elites and economic elites maybe are fine with these changes. The average people often are not. And so you get resentment and you get distrust. At the same time, in the international system, we thought that after1990 essentially what we had to do was kind of what West Germany did in East Germany, extend the systems, extend the institutions and the values of West into the East, and that was going to be, you know, maybe some problems, but basically it was going to work, and that even Russia was going to become this beautiful western-style democracy so you could expand NATO all the way out, and there's no reason to worry about provoking Russia, because the arc of history would bend in the right direction and Russia would become a smiling democracy, maybe one day a member of NATO. 

Right. 

You know, so when none of that stuff didn't happen and Russia began to push back, Turkey has defected essentially from the West. China has moved to become more antagonistic. Iran has broken the order in the Middle East. People do not -- whether they're in America or Europe or many other places, people say this isn't the future you told us was coming. 

Is this -- can I ask -- 

Yes. 

I'd be interested to know, do you feel this is a moment where, similar to the Marshall Plan, a case needs to be made, both to the American people, a case needs to be made to different peoples in Europe to explain what is the international order, what are the institutions that will work. We are in a different world, a globalized economy. Technology is pervasive. The way you are locally and regionally is different today. So is this a turning point or is this an inflection point where all the real case needs to be made? 

Well I don't think anybody has the answers. 

Right. 

You know, this is how do you restore full employment and lifetime job security. Nobody really knows. 

Right. 

And, you know, after 1945, increasingly in the West, we thought we understood where capitalism and history were taking us. I think what we've now reached is we sort of turned a corner and the old rules aren't working, and we don't know yet what the new rules are going to be. 

It's true, we don't know. And let's not forget, we talk about Europe in very broad strokes here, which is normal, because we're Americans and we like to talk in broad strokes about Europe. That's what we do. But all politics -- I hate to repeat this tired cliche, but, you know, Tip O'Neill, all politics is so local. You know what part of the elections in Holland was about? About pension premiums and about health care, but like our version of Obama Care. Geert Wilders didn't have the answers. Now it doesn't make for good conversation at this table. We want to talk to Dan Senor about the global things that are happening. 

Right. 

European Union, is it out? Immigrants, are they in or out? I totally understand. And then one more thing, you've been around a few elections. Every four years the collective sort of international press descends upon that little country by the sea called The Netherlands, you know, where they speed skate and they have a king, and they have a queen from Argentina, oh, how cute, and they write that one every-four-year piece about that country that was once tolerant and now has basically started to vote for this guy who wants to, you know, say no to immigration, integration, anything. And then, of course, there was a lot of snark and a lot of sneer in the Dutch press over the last few days of how they sort of, like, they saw this sort of parachute journalism, these big guns coming in from the New York Times, Fox News, CNN, and they all wrote their little piece and then they move on, go to Paris, about the next piece. But it's all local. It's all about pension plans and retirement age. And he didn't have answers, so they voted for the guy who was already holding office who had better answers. 

But I agree with you that there's -- 

I know that's sort of, like -- that's sort of, like, boring and small, but it's -- 

No. I agree there's no uniform set of issues. 

Exactly. That's all I'm saying. 

On the one hand. 

Yes. 

On the other hand, it appears that each of these countries are looking for their vessel -- 

Of course. 

-- to blow up the system. 

Yes. 

To really challenge the status quo. So in the case of Germany, if, in fact, you know, the SPD leader is the new, you know, Wilders. I'm not saying he is. 

I doubt he's blow up the vessel, but, yes. 

But, right. But, right. Be, yes, he is trying to market himself as this vessel. Le Pen is actually known quantities you were discussing earlier, but -- 

Face it, they're all looking for a Trump. That's what they're looking for. 

During the Brexit campaign Michael Gove, one of the leaders of the Brexit campaign, said, "I think we've heard enough from the experts." It was a very clever device. He didn't say, "It's not our experts versus your experts. It's we're done with the experts." So my question for you, Nell, is, now that Brexit is actually happening, the reality of it is happening, do you think in the UK people are still of the view we're done with the experts? Is this revolt against the experts a sort of new phase we're going to be in for a long time? 

I think, unfortunately, it may be. I don't think there is a clear shift back to the experts. At least from what I can gather from my colleagues over in the UK. I think there is a general populist sentiment, and I think that has remained. I think that remains in this country, and I'm not exactly sure what will change that tide. It is in the ether right now. 

What you could do that ties into what Walter said, you could do good governance. The sitting prime minister, Mark Rutte, with his inexplicable last name, Rutte -- 

Yeah. 

-- he did some good governing. And many people said, you know what, he's doing a fine job. Now he lost seats, but he's still the biggest party. And then we have this weird system where in Holland -- this is typical of course -- that the number two, Geert Wilders, he's going to be number two. He's not going to be able to play with the others in the sandbox because they already said we're not going to play with you. We're going to play with number three, four, and seven and eight, and we're going to make a coalition. I mean, we have 28 parties. It's a totally different system. 

The stories with people with the ballot boxes and-- 

Right. I've heard stories of people having trouble with the ballot box. Oh, the ballot box is like a booklet. It's insane, of course. And in America y
