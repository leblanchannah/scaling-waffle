Eric Ripert is here. He is a chef and co-owner of New York's Le Bernardin. The restaurant holds three Michelin stars and has maintained a four-star rating from "The New York Times" for more than two decades. Ripert's memoir, "32 Yolks", tells the story of his early life and his love affair with food, it is now in paperback. I am pleased to have my friend Eric Ripert back at this table. Welcome, great to have you. 

Thank you, Charlie. It is a pleasure. 

There are many things I want to talk about including the book and including this autobiographical part of this book. Also, tell me about temple cuisine. 

Ah, temple cuisine is something that I am very interested in. And I went to Korea because I think it's where they've mastered really well what temple cuisine is. And I will explain that to you very quickly. Temple cuisine is a vegan diet. 

Right. 

That is, of course, to feed the nuns and the monks. Every ingredient has virtues, medicinal virtues. And for the nuns and monks, who are cultivating the plants in the garden and also cooking, it's a mindful exercise, it's basically meditation, they also put thoughts of love and compassion into the food, and believe that those thoughts will have some benefits for yourself as a consumer. The food is meant to make you strong, healthy, and have a very clear mind. 

But not meant to have you crave it? 

You cannot crave because Buddhism is against attachments. You're not supposed to be attached to anything. So therefore the food is delicious but you never crave like you would crave potentially a chocolate cake or something like that. 

And why has it attracted so much attention, is it because there is clearly more, today, a sense of healthy eating? 

Yes, we want to eat healthy. First of all, it's very seasonal, so, therefore, you eat what it is. You eat what is in season at its best, at its peak. It's organic. And today we are very conscious of what we are eating. Nobody wants to have pesticides in their food. If you have a meat, you don't want antibiotics and growing hormones and so on. It's a movement and, therefore, there is a lot of interest about temple cuisine, although, like I mentioned it's a vegan diet, but it's a big movement in America and I think worldwide today toward vegetarianism and eating more vegetables on our diet -- 

And more plant-based food. 

Absolutely. 

What is it you think makes Le Bernadin the restaurant that it is and have won the plaudits of other chefs and diners as well as the people who write about food? 

Many components make the success of Le Bernadin and where we are today. The team is essential, and we have a very loyal team that stays at Le Bernadin for a long time. To keep a good team around yourself, you have to, of course, be respectful to them. They have to have good compensation and job security and an environment that is not hostile and where people come and are happy to work. I think we have created that. And then you have to be very passionate, work hard, and reinvent yourself all the time, not be afraid of evolving. And this is something that we really are not obsessed, but put a lot of focus on. It's to always evolve and reinvent ourself in terms of service, in terms of atmosphere in a dining room, of course with the food, with new techniques, new ingredients and so on. That makes, I think, Le Bernadin an interesting restaurant in the New York scene because we are not stuck in the past, we, again, are evolving. 

Yes. On the philosophy of living, you decided early on that one-third of your life would be for yourself, one-third will be for your family, and one-third -- have you kept that up? 

Yes. It's not like on a 24-hour day. 

Right. 

It doesn't work like that. But I'm someone who needs a lot of time for myself. And I do -- I read, I meditate, I practice Buddhism as you know in my house. I take breaks, I take vacation, I isolate myself at times during the year. I take retreats and so on. I make sure that I spend some good time with my family, quality time on the weekends and even during the week, vacations. And of course I dedicate a lot of energy and time in Le Bernardin. And I have a good balance. I believe that if you take time for yourself, it gives you the luxury to reflect and have a distance with the family and the business as well. If you do that, the family will support you, that will make you a stronger family member, and also a stronger boss. And then if you are good at work, of course the team will support you and it is a cycle like that. 

Where does the title come from, "32 Yolks? 

"32 Yolks." I am 17 years old in Paris at La Tour d'Argent, and my chef asked me to make Hollandaise sauce which is basically a sabayon, so you whisk the egg yolks and then you add clarified butter. And I think I am going to be able to do it, but I am 17, very skinny, not very strong, very slow, I can't beat 32 yolks into a foamy cloud. And therefore, it ends up being kind of pitiful scrambled eggs. And it will take me weeks to master the Hollandaise sauce and those 32 yolks. 

And how did you do it? Weeks? Later were you able to do it? 

Yes, I was able to do it. Well -- 

But why is that the title of the book? I mean, what does it say? 

Because it is a defining moment in my career. I thought I graduated from school, I was a good student, I am in this restaurant, I am going to excel. And on my first day, I realized that I am very weak compared to the cooks in those three-star Michelin restaurants. They have experience, I don't. So it is like a slap in the face or a wakeup call. And then I was so dedicated, so passionate. I wanted to really, really master the techniques and so on. So even on an afternoon, I would have a small break sometimes, I will go home and I would train -- 

Yes. 

-- to make sure that I am going to master it. And when I did master it, it was basically being also accepted by the team, saying, okay, the kid, he did it. 

Yes. Did the love of cooking come from your family? 

Yes. Love of cooking comes from my grandmothers, my mother mainly as well. Different styles. My mother was very influenced by the chefs of Nouvelle Cuisine and we had a very refined experience at home. My grandmothers were cooking foods from Provence, Italy. 

Yes. 

Soul foods from that region, and less fancy and it was more like no presentation, but the pasta was delicious. So I had those two experience, the very fancy one on beautiful China and very refined silverware and then flowers and candles at night on the table at my mother's house. And then something much more rustic with my grandmothers and the rest of my family. And it was well-known that I love food so much that it would make me happy. The entire family decided that to reward me, all the time they would feed me, basically. 

Also, this is autobiographical. 

Yes. 

And you talk about when your father was gone. 

Yes. 

And what happened? And your mother remarried and you had a stepfather. 

Yes. 

And you talked about being abused. 

Yes. Verbally and physically in a sense that I was beaten. 

Right. 

Yes. 

What impact did that have on you? 

Well, it is never good to be abused, obviously, but I think it developed in me a strength. I was at war with that stepfather that I had. And despite the fact that I was extremely young, I was very resilient. And I was fighting him mostly with my intellect although I was very young. He was not very smart. And I was winning battles. And it was almost -- and it became almost like a game. But I learned how to never give up in that painful moment. And I have been inspired to later on in life make sure that I would create a family that will not be broken and of course where tolerance is a must. And I apply that in every aspect of my life, at work, with family, and with friends. 

And how did you find Buddhism? 

Buddhism. When I came to America, it was an accident. I find a book at the airport that talked about Buddhism. And I was fascinated, I read it. When I landed in Washington, D.C., I asked my mother to send me some books from Dalai Lama, who was becoming famous because he just won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1989. And I started to read. And in the late '90s, beginning of 2000, I started to go to his teachings. I met him many times. And I have other teachers, including one that comes to my house, kindly, once a week to make sure that I am not getting lost with the philosophy, and -- 

But what was it about Buddhism that so compelled you to want to learn more and to become a Buddhist? 

Buddhism is interesting because it is a science or it can be -- the theory can be backed by science. It is also a philosophy and it is a religion, religion in a sense that it has rituals and so on. And I like the three aspects of it, although I love the fact that science can back the theory of Buddhism. And, therefore, it helps you to, in a secular way, bring the teaching and share the teaching with people without being dogmatic, without bringing the fact that it is a religion. 

So you come to Washington D.C. 

Yes. 

You get a job there. 

Yes, at the Watergate Hotel. 

At the Watergate Hotel. 

Yes. 

The famous Watergate Hotel. And that was your first job in America? 

Yes. 

And what brought you to New York? 

Well, I was 24 in Washington and Washington is a very quiet city for 24 years old. It is where serious business goes on and politics, as you know. 

Yes. 

And every weekend I was trying to escape the city and come to New York and party. And I was fascinated by New York, by the architecture, by the dynamic, by the energy, so many people with talent were in New York. I wanted to come here and basically find a place where I could express myself in my art, which is cooking. 

And then how did you find that place? 

I started with David Bouley, downtown. 

Right. 

Stayed about -- 

A famous chef. 

Very famous. He was one of the first American chefs in New York to become like a super celebrity. 

Right. 

Not for being on T.V., but for his talent, for the cook that he was -- the cooking that he was doing. 

And he still is. 

And he still is, of course. 

Yes. 

And then I moved in 1991 at Le Bernardin and never left. 

You do television programs now? 

Yes, sometimes. 

So Le Bernardin, you never had an interest or desire in terms of being able to, as so many people have, to own more than one restaurant, in terms of Le Bernardin name. 

Yes. Of course if you develop restaurants, you make more money, but I am not in my industry because I want to make -- of course I like money because it helps to have a good lifestyle and so on, we know that, it contributes to happiness in many ways, but it is not my main goal. And I started at one point to open restaurants in Washington and Philadelphia and we have one in Cayman Island. And then I realized my balance that we talked about was completely changed and I didn't have time to reflect. No time for the family and Le Bernardin that I love so much, which is the team. So therefore, I decided not to develop and stay focused on Le Bernardin and make sure that I lead the team every day and I inspire the team because when you start to have white hair, Charlie, you become a mentor, right? 

And I look at the book and this paperback, and one of the people endorsing it is your very good friend, Anthony Bourdain. 

Yes. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thank you so much, Charlie, pleasure. 

It is my pleasure. The book is now in paperback, Eric Ripert, it's called "32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line." We will be right back. Stay with us.
