We turn now to the use of a new bomb by the United States in Afghanistan. The US military was heard again today after American forces dropped a 22,000-pound bomb on Islamic State-controlled territory in Afghanistan. The device targeted ISIS' use of roadside bombs, bunkers, and tunnels. It is the first time the bomb, called a GBU-43, has ever been used in combat. The Pentagon also reported that the aircraft from an American-led coalition accidentally killed 18 Syrian fighters aligned with the US on Tuesday, in combat against ISIS. Joining me now from Washington is Dan Lamothe. He is the national security correspondent for "The Washington Post," where he also anchors his military blog which is called Checkpoint. Thank you so much for joining us. This was a great surprise to me. Tell me about the bomb itself, first. 

Thanks for having me, Charlie. So, this bomb has been in development since really prior to the Iraq war, back in 2002, 2003. It is not the heaviest bomb that the United States has, but it is probably the most powerful conventional bomb that they have. The idea is that it could collapse tunnels and it explodes right at the surface rather than some of the other larger bombs that bury down deep to get things that are several hundred feet or 1000 feet deep. 

What is this bomb's purpose? 

This bomb's purpose is largely things at or very close to the surface. So, collapsing tunnels, it sounds like this was probably a network of tunnels, kind of on a mountainside. This would have been something that can take out and collapse a good portion of that area. 

And what does it say about what the threat is of ISIS in Afghanistan? 

It says that it's certainly still there. And we've kind of heard that in cycles in the past. You go back a year-and-a-half or two years, ISIS was kind of popping up as an increasing threat there. At one point, it was -- we were told that it was down to almost nothing. So, to see a strike like this and to hear that several hundred ISIS fighters were potentially in the region, it shows the problem isn't gone. 

Is this -- why did they decide to use it now? Was this a decision by a commander in the field? 

That's an excellent question. From what I have been told, the approval process on this did not go up to the White House and did not go up to the Pentagon. It was made by General Nicholson, who is the top general in Afghanistan and General Votel, who is the Chief for US Central command, kind of overseeing operations across the Middle East. 

Are we likely to deploy this bomb in other places? Or is it specific for a place like Afghanistan? 

It's not really specific to Afghanistan. And really, I think the question is why this bomb and why now? 

That's a very good question. 

Yes. I was talking to a colleague that covered the Pentagon for years kind of at the outset of the Iraq War. And he noted that back then, reporters were regularly asking, have you used this bomb yet, have you used this bomb yet. And for a variety of reasons, they never did back then. Primarily, I think because the explosion is so big that it's much harder to control civilian casualties. In a place like Afghanistan, on a mountainside like this, I think there was much less risk of somebody -- of civilians being in the area. 

And anything from the military or the Pentagon as to whether they plan to use this bomb in other circumstances in Afghanistan? 

No real sense for whether this is something we may see again. But it's certainly something they still have in the arsenal. And in a way, I kind of wonder how much of this was psychological, looking to flex muscles, looking to show that this isn't going to be tolerated and that sort of thing. More of the psy-op sort of thing you hear about with warfare. 

Send a message. 

Exactly. 

Yes. And maybe send a message to North Korea as well? 

I would certainly wonder that myself. 

So, what else do you speculate about? What questions are you asking this evening having written about this? 

Really, the questions are -- when you look at it, something that's been in Afghanistan for years and not used, which is basically what we are hearing about this particular bomb, that it had been in storage there, but it never was used anywhere, the question becomes why now and what were the optics of that, what led them to think that this was the best option rather than, for example, a dozen smaller bombs. I go back to 2015. There was a 30 mile, 30 square mile training camp that was discovered in Southern Afghanistan in Helmand Province. And in that case, they launched scores of air strikes, dozens of air strikes over the better part of a day. But there was nothing this big. It was all more typical bombs that you would see. 

It's clear that this bomb was developed during the Obama administration, isn't it? 

No, actually, this bomb, the development of it started way before that. We're going back to Bush. 

Bush 43. 

Correct, yes. 

Yes. And at that time, did they say what purpose it had? 

Really, it was all of the above. It's anti-personnel, it's looking to level a very, very large area at one time. I know one thing that comes up often with air strikes is they're trying to get to the squirters, they call them. It's typically people you drop one bomb and then you see people running away, fighters running away. And you go in and you'll do additional air strikes. With a larger explosion like this, I imagine that's less of an issue for the US military. You would think they would have been able to get a lot more people at one time. 

Thank you so much for joining us. 

Thanks for having me. 

Pleasure to have you. Back in a moment, stay with us.
