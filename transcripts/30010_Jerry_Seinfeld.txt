Jerry Seinfeld is quitting. Last week he announced that after nine seasons he was pulling the plug on his highly successful NBC sitcom. In 1993 he sat down with me in Los Angeles to talk about the reasons for the success of his show. Why is the show so successful, do you think? What is it about it, you think, that has connected? Because I have friends in New York who say-- ``That's my show.'' 

Yeah. 

``That's my show. That's-- the things that they are about is what I am about.'' It touches their nerve. 

I think it's-- it's hand-made. This is a sitcom that is not-- is not processed-- 

Yeah. 

--through a network, through a large studio system. It's a few people working on this thing and we're just doing what we think is funny. And the cast is amazing. It's an amazing group of talent. I mean, each one of the people in our cast is-- could easily, easily hold their own-- hold down their own show. 

Joining me tonight to talk about what everyone seems to be talking about, Bruce Handy. He wrote the cover story for this week's Time Magazine story about this story. Bill Carter broke the story of Seinfeld's decision in The New York Times. Here is The New York Times for December 26th and it appears above the fold, right there, ``Seinfeld says it's all over and it's no joke for NBC.'' Also here Mary Kaye Schilling -- she's a senior editor at Entertainment Weekly -- and Steve Reddicliffe, editor-in-chief of TV Guide. I begin this conversation not only to assess the significance of this and why it appears on the cover of Time Magazine and why it's also mentioned prominently in Newsweek Magazine and why everybody's talking about this -- somehow a consideration of the impact of this sitcom -- but I begin by the guy who got the story. You got a call. 

Yeah, I got a call and-- 

Saying, ``It's all over, Bill, and I want you to know.'' 

Yeah, that was about it. 

Is that it? 

Uh-huh. Pretty much, yeah. 

You pick up and there's no P.R. guy, there's nothing-- you get a call from Jerry Seinfeld, says-- 

I got a call initially that said that and then it was, like, I'm thinking about talking about it. I'm not sure I want to do it yet. You know, ``Where are you going to be?'' It was Christmas. So I had to sort of rearrange my life a little bit, but-- 

Yeah? So what'd you do? 

--it was a good story. Well, I had-- actually had to drive from New Jersey to Virginia that day, so I wrote in the morning what I knew-- 

Yeah. 

--and Jerry was going to call me later and give me the quotes. And I got all the way down to Virginia and-- and-- he-- it was a little bit longer than I hoped before he got in touch with me again. It was about 7:00 o'clock when I finally spoke to him, so-- but-- but he was-- well, one side of him was still sort of concerned that it was Christmas and he was telling, like, his crew, who didn't know yet. 

Yeah. 

You know, he was going to be telling them through the press and I think he was a little concerned about that. But you know, it was obviously something I was very excited about. 

Did you have any idea it would appear above the fold in The New York Times? 

Well, I don't determine those things. I kind of knew they were excited about it and it was Christmas. There isn't that much going on, so it was pretty good timing on his part. He got great coverage, God knows, everywhere else, so-- 

Why did he do it? 

Well, I think one of the things that he had said to me-- a couple of months earlier I spoke to him and he--  he was talking then-- and I kind of started to think about it then. He talked about the whole idea of being a stand-up comic and getting off the stage at the right time and wanting a standing ovation when you leave and ``Don't wear out your welcome.'' And he talked a lot about that and I kept thinking, you know, ``If he stays one more year, everyone knows he's going to leave'' because no more than one more year because they only had the cast signed up for one more. 

Yeah. 

So that sort of put it in the back of my mind that he was thinking about it. And then he said, you know-- he said, you know, ``I was talking to NBC and they showed me all these statistics and they show that the show hasn't even peaked. Every year it's gotten bigger and bigger.'' And he said-- and he said, ``I turned to NBC and I said, `Well, why would I want it to peak? Once it peaks, you're on the down side. I don't want to ever look back and say, "Oh, that was the peak back there.'' 

I've read so much, I forget who's in what piece, so excuse me. He told someone, maybe you, that he wanted to leave with them standing up, applauding. 

Yes. 

That's the feeling he had, the whole-- the whole metaphor he uses of stand-up comedy as defining his life. 

Yeah. Well, I think that-- yeah, the-- I mean, the down side of it is that-- that, you know, if you stay on-- you know, if you stay on too long, you sort of lose-- you know, lose the audience, even if you're giving them more than-- you know, even if you're giving them more and they think they want more, you know, in reality, you know, maybe they don't want more. They get a little sick of you. And so that-- the timing seemed right. I also think there's a fact-- I think this is a guy who really-- who really cares about his show, who really cares what he's doing. And I think the last thing he wants to see is-- you know, have the-- you know, have the quality peter down. I mean, some people even think the-- you know, the quality has, you know, dropped off this year. I think, you know, he doesn't want to get in a situation like-- I don't know. Not to name names, but you know, like the Roseanne show, where they just-- they just kind of-- you know, they milked-- they-- you know, they milked it dry. I think he-- you know, I think he has respect for his show and respect for his audience. I think-- I mean, I don't know. It was pretty unprecedented. I think maybe that's why it's getting so much attention, that, you know, somebody does something so classy as actually just, you know, kind of exit, you know, this-- this gracefully and this voluntarily. 

You both have mentioned this. Bill Wright and Jack Welch came to see him, had a meeting in Wright's apartment-- 

Yeah. 

--over in Central Park West and sort of said, ``This is how great this show is, and it's growing. It-- what are you talking about leaving now? You don't have to worry about leaving before it reaches its best. It's still growing.'' And they also said, ``How about $5 million an episode,'' which would come to some $90-plus million for another year. And Seinfeld thought about it, was flattered by it, and said? 

Said ``no.'' I mean, what he told me, which seemed interesting and, you know, is probably easy for him to say, but he said, you know, ``In my business, if you care''-- I mean, ``If you care about money-- the way to get money is to not care about money, it's to care about comedy. If you care about money, then,'' you know, ``your comedy-- comedy suffers.'' So-- and, you know, I guess if you make-- I don't know, I keep-- I think the figure of Forbes was he made $96 million last-- $94 million-- 

--so overwhelming. 

Yeah. So, you know-- 

Yeah. 

I wouldn't-- you know, if somebody wanted to pay me $5 million-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, to write an article, I'd be-- I'd be sure. But I guess it's easier for (inaudible) 

What's the significance, Steve, of Jerry Seinfeld to television-- to primetime television, in America? 

Well, it's huge. It's huge. This is the most popular comedy. It's been the most popular comedy for several years. It's very rare for someone to go away when their comedy is on top. Lucy did it after the first show. Andy Griffith ended and it was top-rated then. It's very rare that you walk away, though, when you're on top. And this show anchors an entire night for NBC and it's the most popular night of television. It's a huge night and this will leave a big hole for them to fill. And lots of speculation about what will happen. 

Like, what will NBC do and-- 

Absolutely. 

--especially if they lose E.R. and so-- 

Well, you know, what-- 

--their big night is now-- 

Absolutely. You do put Frasier there and he put Third Rock there or do you move Friends to 9:00? Do you move E.R. to 9:00? And I think there are a lot of questions to answer. 

I asked Jerry this. I've only interviewed him once and that was in 1993. I find him amusing and funny and smart and you saw this in these interviews. I mean, he talks about what television is like, in the piece that you did. What is it, do you think, that made Seinfeld number one, that made this show so popular? 

We were just talking about that outside because it's such a New York show and it always kind of shocked me that it was so popular. And it's such-- I mean, we're talking about four people who really hate each other on some level and there's some talk now that we're going into the ``post-ironic'' phase of culture because of the success of Titanic, that people want everyone to be nice to each other now and that Seinfeld sort of personified the late '80s, early '90s, the kind of cynicism and-- I think that's true, to a certain extent, but-- but I think it's sort of unfathomable on some level, except that it was a terrifically funny show. 

Yeah. 

I think that's the bottom line. I mean, it made you laugh. It was well-crafted. The cast was the best. It's right up there with Mary Tyler Moore-- 

Yeah. 

--the original show. I mean, all of them are flawless. This year I think they've sort of become caricatures of caricatures because they were caricatures, in some ways, but I just can't-- I don't think you can deny how funny and how brilliant the show is. 

He didn't like the -- Bill. 

I think-- you know, what he said repeatedly is the show was only about comedy. It was never about anything else. It was never about all those other things that get stuck into sitcoms that occasionally make you turn your stomach because the characters are so fake and false and are-- you know, all of a sudden, they're hugging each other or somebody has a disease or-- it was only about being funny, only about the little things in life that are funny. And if you can do that week after week and actually make people laugh out loud, boy, that's rare. How many shows have been able to do that? I think it's a unique show from that perspective. 

There's never been a ``very special episode'' of Seinfeld. 

No hugging, no learning-- 

And I think that's-- 

A very what? A very special-- 

There's never been a ``very special episode'' of Seinfeld. 

You know, where-- where George is on drugs. 

A tragedy-- 

You know, that's a ``very special episode.'' They don't do that. 

The one time they did that was that funny intervention and, you know, they've made fun of all of that kind of thing. 

Exactly. 

And I think, you know, they have not-- there have-- there's no T.V. convention to this, other than the fact that it's funny. 

I just-- I think, too-- I think, when you're getting-- and I think there's-- you know, I mean, yeah, it's all about-- it's all trying to be funny, but at the same time, I mean, there's truth in it, too. I mean, not to make too big a point of it, but what you-- you know, what you were talking about, you know, that these people hate each other, I think-- you know, I hope I don't sound too cynical, but I think-- you know, I think in all friendships there's a certain-- you know, there's a certain, you know, undercurrent of distaste or distrust, too. I think that's just-- 

And jealousy or-- 

That's human nature and you don't-- you don't see that-- you know, I mean, it's really-- you certainly don't see that on television. Yeah, in this case, it's sort of glorified. 

Well, people say things to each other that other people think about-- 

Yeah. Right. 

--and don't say and they do. They say that to each other. They call each other-- you know, Jerry says something to George that's just devastating, but he's his best friend, so he's-- you know, they just go on. 

Yeah. 

Yeah, people see themselves in the characters. Even if they don't actually do the things that these characters do, they all say, ``Oh, I have a friend that's just like that'' or-- or else they want to have that-- that circle of friends, these people that live next door. And plus, it's the perpetual child thing. I mean, Jerry never grows up. There's no kids. There's no responsibility. 

Right. 

You know, it's all hedonistic. And I think when Seinfeld came on, which is one thing that the T.V. business seems to forget, is that it was surprising. There was nothing else like it. And it, you know, spawned a whole series of copycat shows. But now they keep trying to, you know, do it again and they can't and-- and they need to be looking for the things that are as surprising as Seinfeld was when it first came on, that breaks molds instead of-- 

Yeah. I think what Bruce was saying is true. I think you recognize some of yourself in every one of those characters. There are universal truths there and universal traits that aren't that-- aren't very flattering, but they are funny. And when you make fun of them, it's-- it really works. 

I asked Steve Kroft to come join us this evening. He couldn't because he was out of town. But he did a very interesting profile of Jerry Seinfeld February 7th, 1997, and now you'll see a small excerpt from that, courtesy of our friends at 60 Minutes. Here it is. 

How many-- 15 years, 16 years-- I wasn't going anywhere. You know, this is it. I got 45 minutes of observations about planes and cough syrup and that's it. I get away with that. I make a living. And I thought even if I ever did manage to get on T.V., I'm not the kind of guy people get excited about, you know? I just do a nice-- I'm like a good carpenter, you know? I do nice, detailed work. You know, to me, Robin Williams, that's a star, you know? I just didn't think of myself as that kind of guy. And I'm not that kind of guy! 

NBC didn't think he was that kind of guy, either. They initially signed him because they were afraid some other network might hire him as a late-night competitor for the Tonight show. They let him try a sitcom just to keep him busy and preview audiences hated it. The research report hangs on the wall of his home in Los Angeles. 

This is the audience test on the pilot back in 1989. ``Pilot performance''-- 

``Weak.'' 

--``weak.'' 

``No segment of the audience was eager to watch the show again.'' 

Here's another great line. ``Viewers felt that Jerry needed a better back-up ensemble.'' Can you imagine a better back-up ensemble in the world than those three people? 

In the end, NBC stuck its neck out and ordered four episodes. 

Which is the smallest number of episodes ever ordered by a network-- four. I mean, six is a slap in the face. Four is like-- 

``Don't quit your day job.'' 

That's great! Now, here's what's interesting, too, is that he thought it would be the hardest thing in the world to say to the people who are part of this show, ``It's over,'' because they'd just gotten a big contract raise to $600,000, $650,000 an episode and yet your story, somebody's story, says-- 

Yeah. Well, we-- our reporters-- I didn't-- I didn't actually interview the rest of the cast, but one of our reporters, Jeffrey Ressner, did, and they all said-- I mean, they-- they were basically saying, I think, all three of them-- 

The rights-- 

--that, you know, ``Hey, we'd be happy to''-- you know, ``We certainly would have been happy to do it another year,'' but they respected what-- you know, what Jerry was saying about the timing of it and they didn't have a problem with it. They supported him 100 percent. 

Last summer, I talked to Jason Alexander and he said, you know, "This character-- I can't do anything more with this guy.'' I mean, the writers can write funny and I can play funny, but I can't''-- you know, there's nothing more he can really do with it. So I don't think he was-- any of them felt like, creatively, they had to do another year, so it would only have been for the money. And they all felt all along that they were into something so special that if it was time to go, they weren't going to fight it. Even-- you know, they'll all do well. They'll make big deals for themselves in the future and they won't suffer financially. 

I'm sure they're doing okay, too, before they-- 

Two questions. One-- is there anything on American television from any of the four or five networks-- six-- how many do we have now? -- that approaches Seinfeld? Is there a Seinfeld wannabe in the making anywhere out there? 

Well, I think The Simpsons is in a league of Seinfeld's stature. I think its accomplishments each and every week, I think they rival Seinfeld. It's not the same kind of show. It's a cartoon show in which the people are yellow, but-- 

But it's also been on many, many years. And the interesting thing about Seinfeld was it came-- it got its break at exactly the right time for NBC. I mean, they-- it got-- it was such a disaster for them, when they were able to finally move Seinfeld behind Cheers for half of a season when Cheers announced it was going to quit, and it-- the whole country all of a sudden saw a show that had only been sort of a favorite among a cult audience and it just took off. And I don't see anything like that on the horizon, where there's a show-- 

Yeah, I don't think-- 

I mean, I think Everyone Loves Raymond is a very good show. 

It's a great show. 

A very, very good show. But on CBS, it'll never get seen by that kind of audience. 

Yeah. And I think-- 

The thing about Raymond-- sorry. 

Go ahead. 

The thing about Raymond that Seinfeld shares is that even though his name was on the show, it truly is an ensemble show. I mean, he's one of the most generous performers on television in that he really gives his back-up performers equal time and he's always given them complete credit. And you really feel that generosity. You look at a show like Veronica's Closet, where, you know, she's hogging all the lines and taking it away from everything, and you see why-- or Frasier is a really good ensemble show. I don't think it will ever achieve Seinfeld's status or, you know, ratings, but-- 

The very few shows that-- 

--it's a wonderful show. 

That's the other thing. You have to recognize this is a once-in-a-decade, or two decades, kind of thing, where-- 

It's Cheers-- 

It's The Honeymooners. 

--and Cheers and M*A*S*H, The Honeymooners and Lucy. 

I mean, I-- Honeymooners and Lucy are the shows that I always refer to because I had a conversation about -- with Jerry about this. The main thing about that is that it's four New York characters in an apartment. It's the same plot. The three shows have the same plot! 

Yeah. 

He says that he doesn't think he's yet a great comedian. He says there are two great comedians-- 

Cosby and-- 

And Richard Pryor. 

--and Richard Pryor. 

Richard Pryor. And he's not there yet. Is he right? 

Yeah, I think so. I think Jerry is an excellent-- 

He's not there yet? 

No. He's an excellent stand-up comedian and I think he wants to go to a greater dimension. I think he wants to fill those shoes. And you know, he's proved there are a lot of things he can do, if he puts his mind to it, and I wouldn't bet against him. 

His body of work before he did the show was modest, as he pointed out there. It wasn't-- he didn't have a Cosby-like background of album after album and, you know, concert after concert. So he really developed, I think, through this show. 

With Larry David. I mean, I think you have to give Larry David-- 

Oh, absolutely. 

Larry David is-- who is Larry David? Explain who he is. 

He was the co-creator of the show. He was also Jerry's friend. He's kind of a George character. He was the voice of George. And he left last season. 

But will be writing the last episode. 

But will be writing the last episode. 

The last episode is interesting. It will-- it will be shot partly in New York-- number one-- 

I don't think it's the last. 

No, I think-- he told me they're going to film one-- one of the-- they have 10 more episodes to shoot and one of them will be shot in New York. He didn't know which one, but I don't think it was going to be the final one. 

Larry David is writing the last one. And also, it'll be accompanied by a documentary about the making of the last show. Or, a mock documentary? 

Yeah, a Spinal Tap thing. 

Oh, it's a Spinal Tap thing? PANELISTS: Yeah. Yeah. 

A real documentary would be fairly scary. 

What? 

Scary. 

Scary! And Seinfeld is off now to do for HBO a kind of stand-up thing-- 

Right, for the summer. 

--called ``Everything I Have to Say'' or something like that. 

Yeah. He's ending his-- he's burying his old act in this, which is another bold thing to do. Yeah, another bold thing to do. 

What do you mean, ``burying his own act''? 

He's going to do his old material and then never do it again. 

So he's sort of forcing himself to write new material and he's kind of setting himself a public challenge. 

This guy's closing the book on a lot of stuff in a short period of time. It's going to be interesting to see that fresh start. 

Here's one more look at Jerry Seinfeld-- 

You think you're immature? 

Oh, yeah. 

In what ways? 

Name one. No, name one. 

Sexually? 

Yeah. 

Why? 

Oh, I don't know. 

What do you mean? 

I'm embarrassed. 

Huh? 

I am not going to talk about being sexually immature on 60 Minutes! 

But you think you are? 

It's not 60 Swinging Minutes, you know. 

Right. Right. But you said ``Name one'' and I named one. 

Okay. Well-- well, I'm 42 years old. I'm not married. That's not real mature. That's nothing to be proud of. 

An extraordinary television event. 

I think one of the most extraordinary ones in recent memory and I think the finale will be unbelievable. 

Will break all records, you want to predict, Mr. Carter, for-- for-- 

I think it'll be-- 

--watching a television show? 

Well it'll be hard to be at the level of M*A*S*H, the final episode, because when that was on, the networks were so much stronger. 

--the 1997 dollar-- 

Yeah, that's it, the 1990 rating dollars-- it's-- it's through the roof. Through the roof. 

Julia Louis-Dreyfus told Entertainment Weekly that the last episode should be that they all  finally get what they want and they go off for a celebratory drive in a car and it explodes. 

And they have said that there'll be nothing like that because-- 

Right. Larry David-- 

Larry David said, ``I'm not writing anything like that.'' Let me ask you one thing. 

Yeah? 

What is this-- I mean, what is this fingernail polish on your fingers? 

Oh, okay. I am going to talk about this on national T.V. Well, the story is my niece-- I was in California for the holidays and my niece got fingernail polish, so I put it on, yeah sure, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So anyway, my wife kind of liked it. She said it turned her on and it was kind of sexy, so I was-- And then she said, ``Wear it on. Wear it when you go meet Jerry.'' So I put it on, and it was funny. And I told-- you know, Jerry asked me why I was wearing fingernail polish and I told him because my wife-- you know, it kind of turned her on and she wanted me to keep wearing it. And he was, like, ``Oh, that'd be a great story for George. You know, it is kind of''-- 

Now, this is the last episode. 

That's going to be it! 

If you wear this on Charlie Rose, you know, you are going to be one happy man, so-- I don't know. 

So Helen is one happy woman. 

Is this over yet? 

One last thing before we go. You have done nine covers-- 

On Seinfeld, yes. 

--on Seinfeld? 

Yeah. 

Nine covers? 

Yes. And he is extremely popular, always-- always will be. He's popular in reruns. He's popular in original episodes. He's popular on magazine covers. People like him. 

Yeah. He says he wants to do a talk show. 

Well, we said-- he-- 

Or might consider a talk show, but didn't want to do a sitcom. 

I asked-- I-- I posed it, you know, ``Would you-- would you do a talk show?'' ``Yeah.'' You know, it was kind of like that. 

Oh, I see. 

It wasn't, like-- I don't think there's a concrete plan in this. 

I don't think he's quite sure what he's going to do yet, but I think he's smart enough to know he can't do another sitcom, not for a long time, maybe never. 

Because he'll be competing with himself. 

Because he-- exactly. It's impossible to compete with that-- 

How much money has Jerry Seinfeld made and will he make from this situation comedy? 

I think he will personally make several hundred million dollars. 

Like Bill Cosby. 

Yes. For sure. Because this thing will run forever. 

Yeah. 

This is the kind of-- you know, you see The Honeymooners that are still on? This will still be on. It's got that kind of-- 

You know, I know he says he doesn't want to come back. I would find it hard to believe that three, four, five years from now he is not back, in the way of Bob Newhart and Bill Cosby and the great comedians who preceded him. 

Here is what he said to me -- this was 1993 -- that struck me. He said, ``I love stand-up. I love to get out of here and still go do stand-up.'' Now, I don't know whether he feels that way today or not. 

He does. 

That's exactly what he told me. I mean, he-- 

He told me the same thing. 

Yeah. 

--New York, too. He doesn't like L.A. 

He's going to move here, he says. 

Yes. Definitely. 

He has this weird-- I don't know if a lot of comics (unintelligible) always this sort of-- this sort of a, I don't know, Samurai mentality-- 

Yeah. 

--or something that, you know, going out, and stand-up is sort of the purest thing, like, they either laugh or they don't. It's just you and the audience. You know, nobody is-- you're not pretending to be anything else. It's-- 

And most stand-ups desperately want to get out of it. They hate it. It's so humiliating when they're not successful, they hate it. It's awful. 

Yeah, they want to do what he's doing. 

Yes. 

Exactly. And they're using stand-up as a-- as a pathway to their own sitcom-- 

Right. 

--or their own talk show or something. 

Right. 

Here's the other thing that's a great-- the question was raised as to whether this year is not as good as previous years. And he said this wonderful think, I thought. He said, what are you talking about? He said, ``Thirty-five million people,'' or whatever the number is, "watch this show and I'm worried about one critic or two critics who might have said it's not quite as good?'' He said, ``It's like me doing stand-up and if 5,000 people in the room and 4,998 are on their feet and I'm worried about the two that are not on their feet. Not likely to happen.'' 

Right. But I do think he is aware of the fact that his show is not quite at the level that it was before and-- 

He is aware? 

--he wants-- I think he is. 

And it bothers him and-- 

Don't you think-- 

--maybe that's the-- 

--he's aware of that? 

He- he claimed to totally disagree with it. He said, you know, maybe the first-- you know, ``So we're uneven. It's always been uneven. It's supposed to be uneven. It's designed to be uneven.'' 

But in his heart of hearts? 

In his heart of hearts? Oh, I don't know. I couldn't-- I wouldn't want to-- 

He was cracking along at that level-- 

Yeah. I think if he thought it was great, he would not leave. 

I think that's part of it. 

You think so? 

I also think that he's very loyal to his-- his writers and I don't think he really wants-- I mean, he really doesn't take credit for the show and I don't think he'd want to trash the show because he is a nice man (unintelligible) 

Thank you, all. 

Thank you. Nice to be here. 

We'll be right back. George Plimpton is here, talking about Truman Capote, and we'll remember Brendan Gill. Stay with us.
