Russia, Wall Street and MSNBC when we continue. Russian president Boris Yeltsin met with Vice President Al Gore today at a health resort just outside of Moscow. His abrupt cancellation of their meeting yesterday gave rise to new speculations about Yeltsin's health. It was the Russian president's first official meeting since he disappeared from public view a week before winning the July 3rd presidential run-off. Joining me now to look at the events in post-election Russia David Remnick of The New Yorker magazine and Andrew Nagorski, Moscow bureau chief for Newsweek. I'm pleased to have both of you. I said this off the air, so I'll say' it on the air. David, I-- this is a wonderful piece that you have written called-- look at this -- ''The War for the Kremlin. The real story behind Boris Yeltsin's victory, including a canceled coup in March, could make the Russian novel obsolete.'' We'll talk about that, but first today's events. How sick is Boris Yeltsin? 

No one knows. I just-- I just returned from Moscow two days ago and you hear various things and we all know he's had a record of very serious heart problems. He's had a record of heavy drinking. He's outlived the average Russian male by seven years. There's another component, though, that seems to be quite present here, I was hearing from a lot of sources in Moscow, is that whatever his physical state, he seems to be on an emotional down of very big proportions right now. It started before the run-off of the election and has continued through-- and they-- he's been able to be in good enough physical state to have these controlled appearances on-- with his own camera grows, to get to see Gore today. But they don't seem to trust him to be out there in front of the international press. 

Well, what's the cause of the emotional down? 

No one's quite sure. I mean, I've heard various theories. One-- I mean, this-- he has a record of-- of these ups and downs and of-- 

Is he a manic-depressive or something that-- 

Whether it's manic-depressive or simply a man who really gets pumped up for-- for-- as he did for the campaign and then when it seems that things are beginning to go right, then he suddenly goes into a huge funk. But there is another theory out there, which I can't say is provable or not -- it's-- we're still back to Kremlinology on this one -- and that is that he-- to keep him going during the campaign, he had various kinds of medication and the fact that you saw him dancing and doing these amazing-- you know, having this amazing stamina was helped in some way and that the help may have been withdrawn a little too abruptly-- 

Yeah. 

--or with the wrong mixture or something and this may have contributed to his-- his emotional crash. 

You know, this is-- this is in no way guesswork. I mean, Andy has hit it right on the head. And in his second volume of memoirs, Yeltsin quite directly talks about being prone to bouts of depression and locking himself up in a sauna and the only way he was dragged out was that his bodyguard came in and took him out. He is a-- he is an emotional roller-coaster type figure and moreso in these recent years, these last three or four years. And he's on terrible-- terribly strong medication because of various ailments, including his back and his heart and all the rest, and God knows what else to make him get through this campaign, which for him was a burst of activity unseen since 1992 or so. 

Is there an expectation that he will not make it through his term? 

I think the expectation-- you know, this is all guesswork-- 

Of course it is. 

--and all the rest, but almost-- I would say all political sides operate under the assumption that he will not make it through his full term. 

Will he make it through-- I don't mean to narrow this down, and again, it's guesswork, but is there an expectation that he will never be at full force and that, you know-- 

Well, if-- 

--in a year we may see a change in power in Moscow? 

It's quite possible. It's quite possible. In fact, I remember well, and Andy does, too, these days right in between the two rounds, especially several days before the second round, everybody standing by the wire machine, a la the days of Brezhnev, Chernenko and Andropov, on a death watch. He didn't appear. Day went-- you know, day after day went by and then he finally gives this little two-minute speech in which he looked, you know-- 

Looked like a wind-up doll. 

Well, as if-- as if the formaldehyde had already been pumped in. 

Yeah. 

And I don't mean to be cruel, but this is-- he's a completely different type of figure than, certainly, we remember-- 

One of the interesting-- 

--from 1991. 

--things in your piece is that General Lebed went to see him during that period. 

Yeah. 

And they denied him access, said, ''You can't see''-- 

Well-- 

--''the president,'' and Lebed said-- 

Yeah. I have-- I have to make-- be sure that it's-- and it's sourced this way in the magazine, that this comes from reliable journalists. 

Right. 

It's not absolutely sure, but the story-- 

I've heard the story before. 

The story goes like this, is that Lebed wanted to see Yeltsin, and Lebed is very-- a colorful figure, as you know. And they said, ''Well, you can't see the president. He's a little bit under the weather.'' And Lebed says, ''Well, I'll go straight to 

Yeah, what does that say about Lebed? 

Well, Lebed is a-- you now have a Kremlin that has a kind of three-cornered power situation, with Yeltsin sitting somewhere on the top, rather moribund. But you now have the prime minister, Chernomyrdin, who, by the way, would become president, at least temporarily, in case of the death of the president. You have the new chief of staff, I think is the title, Anatoly Chubais-- (crosstalk) 

I mean, that's effectively the function. 

Yeah. Right. 

He's chief of administration. 

But that's an interesting-- 

And then Lebed. 

I'll come back to that choice in a minute because he was a guy who he kicked out and then brought back in. 

We were also-- I was surprised by that, that Chubais-- Chubais swore on his-- on his mother's grave that he would not come-- 

Because he's quoted in here. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. Okay, but let me stay with Lebed. I mean, Lebed has what power? There are some people who speculate that-- that now that Yeltsin has won reelection, he's going to get rid of Lebed and that Lebed will not maintain the power that he has. 

Well, that gets to that-- to that-- that moment when Lebed could not get into the Kremlin because right after Yeltsin's victory, the next day, who-- who pays calls on him? Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. Lebed is-- who's been all over the airwaves, who's been the most up-- most visible figure all along, suddenly cannot get in. He doesn't get in until the next day and that signal, I think, is that-- goes directly into that theory, that Yeltsin, between round 1 and round 2, is giving him full throttle, make-- make sure his supporters know that he's-- he's a big, powerful man in this new line-up. Then as soon as they vote for Yeltsin, the deed's done. Cut him-- cut him down. 

But it even goes back further than that. Didn't the Yeltsin forces help fuel the Lebed candidacy, so that-- 

Oh, yes. 

--it would be sure that he came in-- 

The deal was cut-- 

--third? 

--before the round 1. 

Yeah. Oh, it was in March. 

There was money. 

In March. 

Yeah, there-- there was-- 

Lebed-- late March, Lebed starts to get money, help, speech writers and-- 

Air time. 

Yeah, air time and-- (crosstalk) 

Very important. Denied to others. 

Here's what I want to know. Tell me how you think the Russian government is going to be? What's going to-- how is it going to shape up? Lebed is there. You got-- Chubais is back now as some kind of chief of staff. Grachev is gone, the defense minister. 

Right. 

Lebed's sort of has-- has-- (crosstalk) 

--appointed defense minister. 

Yeah. 

And-- and the-- you know, the-- one of the little frissons, the little horrifying notes about-- about Lebed, who's-- the person he wanted to appoint defense minister as soon as he got his position was the guy who ran the operation in Georgia in 1989, in which people were beaten up and killed with shovels and poisonous gas. You might remember that incident-- 

Yeah. 

--a general named Rodionov. Lebed is all-- is learning on the job every minute and, for example, he, in the campaign, was firmly against the war in Chechnya. Chechnya can go its own way. And now he's flipped completely and become just as hawkish as anybody else. 

And Russian troops have moved back in and-- 

Yeah. And bombing the hell out of villages and-- 

Yeah. 

--so on. So it's not over. 

So-- but what's going to be the tenor of this government? Now that he's been reelected, and at a time in which Yeltsin's people were showing him polls that said, ''You-- you're going to have a hard time winning this thing. We might as well just cancel this election because we're never going to give power to the communists. Let's just cancel the election and take over.'' And he said, ''No,'' you know, and then somebody-- he's now won power. He's won reelection in a democratic election, which is an important point to make, I guess. What's going to be the tenor? I mean, what about democratic reform? What about the march of-- of a free market economy? 

I think what's interesting here is not simply the scorecard, how many so-called ''liberals'' or ''democrats'' will you have in this government, as opposed to hard-liners, but will there be a government that focuses on the business at hand, which is trying to make some order out of this chaotic situation, trying to get a decent tax system, trying to get-- trying to deal with crime, trying to do those things. Or will you have simply competing interests and groups who are-- who see, ''Okay, Yeltsin's weak. He could go any time'' and the only thing is we'll have a prolonged power struggle? Obviously, there are going-- these two things are going to be happening concurrently, but the question is if one drowns out the other completely. 

Leading to instability, leading to indecision, leading to-- 

Well, leading to instability, but I have to say that I think, in the overall, that the real story, if you're going to-- if you're going to look for something good in this, because I think this regime is-- is quite gray, at best, and can-- has tendencies toward worse-- the reason one might have thought it was better that Yeltsin won, as opposed to the other people, was that under Yeltsin and under this regime, the possibility for development of society outside the Kremlin walls was much greater, that the-- that the communist regime, if it had been installed, might not have resembled Stalin in any way, despite its affection for Stalin, but would have tried to do things that would have, you know, driven society back into a hole. Here you have the development of possibly, over the next several years, of a middle class, possibly of human rights taking hold, of elements of democracy, at least. You know, the interesting thing about this election was not that it was developed democracy, but how much its half democracy and half authoritarian style resembled the regime itself, what's going on in Russia itself. 

Yeah. 

This was not a democratic election, as we understand it. 

But it also mirrors their-- the-- sort of mirrors the psyche and the experience of Boris Yeltsin. 

Right. 

Sort of half democrat -- practical, pragmatic democrat, in part -- on the other hand, authoritarian, coming out of-- 

Right. He has both impulses going and, as I think I tried to-- to make clear in this piece, you know, yes, he won a democratic election, but when he saw in March that he was probably going to get iced and he had approval ratings of about 5 and 6 percent and he was mostly surrounded by his bodyguard and his rather hawkish deputy premier running the campaign, at that point, he was all set to sign papers canceling the election-- 

Right. 

--and the only reason-- 

Was leaning toward it. 

--he did not-- leaning toward it-- and the-- and had already sent troops to surround the Parliament, if rather lightly. And the reason he pulled out, the biggest reason he pulled out and decided to go forward was because his interior minister said, ''Look, I can't guarantee the loyalty of my troops and there'll be bloodshed in the street. So if you want to cancel the elections,'' you know, basically, ''you're on your own, Boris Nikolayevich.'' Now, it might not have been as cut-and-dried as that, but that is the outline of the story. 

Yeah, but-- but go ahead. 

Yeah. I was just going to-- that was, I think, the crucial stand of the interior minister, but I think there is something else at work here. I think, in his heart, Yeltsin believes-- could not believe he would be thrown out of office by elections and that when there was a faction within his camp which told him, ''Look, there's an alternative to this, is to run a good campaign and win it,'' he wanted to believe that. 

It's amazing. They showed him some pictures of him campaigning when he was in great health, robust health, and then showed the comparison of how weak and insipid he looked-- 

Remember this, though-- 

--and he-- 

--about the campaign and his robust health, that-- that those appearances were-- were produced the way you would produce not news here, but a drama or a situation comedy in the United States, that he would be given lots of rest and then he would be put up and he'd do something vigorous and the media was producing it for him. The guy that was running NTV was also running his image campaign. 

All right, let me just talk about that, about the election of Boris Yeltsin, which when you and I talked, at some point during the year, was about 5 or 6 percent, yes? 

Right. Right. 

And-- and Zyuganov was at what, 16 or 20 or whatever he might have been. 

You know, Zyuganov was always in the 20s or, you know, and up to 30, at times. 

You know where I'm going here. I mean, here's Time magazine-- ''Yanks to the rescue-- the secret story of how American advisers helped Yeltsin win.'' You suggest, and others have suggested, that it is an enlargement of reality and the facts to suggest that American advisers played a significant role in the election of Boris Yeltsin. 

Let me put this delicately. 

Okay. 

The idea that some American advisers, non-Russian-speaking, not experienced in Russian politics, could go to Russia and hole up in the Presidential Hotel -- these are people that couldn't get Pete Wilson to the New Hampshire primary -- could then turn around the Russian election is preposterous. Now, you know, this story of American advisers helping out the Russian campaign in some way is a nice story of small proportion, but I'm afraid that Time really blew it out of proportion, not out of any ill intent or anything like that, and the reporters involved-- 

Maybe the advisers enlarged their own role and what they said to-- 

I think that's-- I think that-- 

Okay. 

--had a-- the biggest-- (crosstalk) 

Here is something that I don't think you'll quarrel with. People who made millions and billions of dollars decided that if they wanted to hold onto those billions of dollars, they'd better get behind Boris Yeltsin and open up their purse and get it on the street fast. 

Oh, absolutely. 

And that made a difference and a big difference. 

That made a-- made a difference, but I think what made a difference, essentially, was that people examined themselves in Russia and said, ''Do we-- with all of the problems of the current situation, do we want to face a possible return to some version of the past,'' which the communists undoubtedly represented, ''or do we want to keep-- keep going, even if we don't particularly like Boris Yeltsin, the style of leadership he's developed,'' and the decision for anybody with a stake in the new system, whether it was a huge stake -- the big businessmen -- or a young student who saw in this situation, ''I've got some career opportunities. I can-- I can make-- make something of my life''-- that decision was pretty simple. And they then-- it was, of course, then the big money, the big media-- 

Yeah. 

--that then helped focus that question-- 

Yeah. 

--in a way that other people thought of it in the same way. 

Plus Yeltsin was throwing around a lot of money from the state-- 

Lots of-- 

--treasury to-- 

Lots-- yeah. 

Who was the woman who hadn't had-- been on line to get a phone for eight years-- (crosstalk) 

But, you know, I-- Andy makes the crucial point. I mean, once-- once the campaign was able to successfully frame the question as ''Forward or back,'' then it was-- then it was cooked. And the big vote for Zyuganov was naturally and justifiably and with sympathy in the poorest regions, in places like Ivanova, where 75 percent of people-- 

Right. 

--are out of work, or in farming regions where their collective farms have fallen apart. I mean, one can understand that. 

And it's very generational. (crosstalk) Older people voted for Zyuganov, younger for-- for-- 

Zyuganov will still be a player because of the communist bloc in the Duma? 

He'll be a player, but I think what's interesting here is that-- yeah, the communist bloc will be the largest opposition bloc and it will remain so. But I think you will not see in-- in the discussion of the succession struggle now, basically, the Zyuganov option is out, Zyuganov and what he represents. The idea that he could still come back and-- and re-run this campaign-- 

Yeah. 

You had your shot, especially with the demographics of his electorate. He had to win now-- 

Yeah. 

--or he doesn't win. 

I-- 

So what would it be? If-- if Yeltsin would die, you think it would be, then, Lebed against Chernomyrdin or some-- I think we're talking Lebed. We're talking Chernomyrdin, certainly, the prime minister. We may be taking about Mayor Luzhkov of Moscow-- 

We're not talking about Yavlinsky? 

Yavlinsky, I think, has-- has-- ran a very poor campaign. He's-- he's a favorite of-- of many Westerners and many-- 

Many New York Times columnists. 

Yes. But I think he-- he has-- has never reached above 7 percent of the electorate-- 

Yeah. 

--and I think there's a reason for that, more than feeling that he's been wronged by Boris Yeltsin. 

I don't have time to talk about this, but there's-- you open in-- with a little thing called ''the spy master'' and you talk about going to meet Kryuchkov-- 

The former KGB-- 

--the former KGB head. You know, and you go in there and he's-- he still has a nice apartment and he has a dacha outside of Moscow. This is a guy who was plotting a coup. 

Treason doesn't seem to have the same effect in Russia as other places. 

Yeah. He doesn't-- he doesn't-- he says-- what does he say about Ames? 

He says that he was-- he certainly-- 

Money. 

Money was a factor, but he thinks that-- 

He did it out of political-- 

--he certainly did it out of political-- 

Ideology. 

And-- and that a lot of Americans understand this. 

He didn't know who Hiss-- Alger Hiss was. 

Didn't even ring a bell. 

Didn't ring a bell. So ''Maybe I''-- but it didn't ring a bell. And-- and on Oswald, he said? 

He said, ''You know, if there had been anything untoward, we would have told you about it by now.'' 

You felt reassured, right? 

I was moved and reassured. 

Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, David. We'll be right back. We'll learn all about MSNBC when we continue. Stay with us. Today the stock market continued its roller-coaster ride, posting a modest gain after dropping as much as 166 points. Michael Price is one of the nation's best-known top-ranking money managers. His approach to investing helped bring about the Chase-Chemical merger earlier this year. He recently sold his firm to the nation's fifth largest mutual fund company in a deal that could ultimately total $800 million. It is an appropriate time to have him on this broadcast to talk about the market, about the economy and about his own decision to sell his firm. I'm pleased to have him here on this program. Welcome. 

Thanks for having-- 

It's great to have you here, especially since I know you don't do this very much. Tell me about what's going on in the market-- 

Oh, you know-- 

--because-- 

--it's just real fully priced and there's very little room for error, so any time anyone comes out and disappoints in the least bit, people use it as an excuse to sell and they're now getting almost 7.5 percent on 30-year Treasuries, which is pretty safe money. 

Yeah. 

And that's attractive. For the first time in three or four years, people are finding attraction in bonds. 

Okay, but just slow up for me when you say all that. How much of it-- you have two companies, Hewlett-Packard-- 

Right. 

--Motorola, report less than expected earnings performance. 

Right. 

And we all know the stock market goes up and down based on-- 

Right. 

Companies' stock prices go up and down based on their earnings performance. And all of a sudden, they look at that and everybody says, ''Technology stocks are going down because of what happened to Hewlett-Packard and Motorola'' and all of a sudden, because they say ''Technology stocks have fueled this market, we're now headed into a bear market.'' You're saying it's none of that? 

Well, no. We don't invest in technology stocks and I have no idea why people own these things at 25 times earnings-- 

Yeah. 

--because we have no ability to-- to guess the future and how their new products will-- will do and when these products will become obsolete. But I think what Wall Street is, is getting very hot on earnings growth and technology and they're starting to cool when they look at the risk in technology and that's what's happening. That's why you see stocks come down so quickly. 

And what about those people who say, ''Yes, that's true. It's psychology and people worry about it's overheated, but it's also a fear that interest rates are going up''? 

You know, it's all psychology. It's all expectations and anticipation and people's feelings about the future. It-- in certain groups of stocks, it has nothing to do with the fundamental economic value of a company. Nothing. It's everyone's hope and greed for the future. When the fear sets in, this is what you see happening. 

Now, see, this is amazing to me. I mean, this-- is this why Warren Buffet has made so much money in investing, because he understood what Benjamin Graham was writing about and the fundamentals of a company-- 

Oh-- 

--and so therefore he missed the ups and downs, based on the-- the emotional play-- 

Well, he-- 

--of the stock market? 

He says, which is a great way to put it, that in the short run, a stock market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a scale. It's a weighing machine. And what has to happen is things have to come back to their economic values and often come below that. And that's when we try and take advantage of the opportunities in Mutual Shares, but a lot of people get caught up because of the momentum and the-- and the quick gains in the higher-priced stocks. 

Fidelity lost a ton-- a billion dollars more in asset shrinkage yesterday, right? About that. 

I don't know. 

Maybe-- (crosstalk) 

Probably a good guess. 

And it-- it all of a sudden, I guess, kind of came back up today. 

Right. 

So where's the psychology as we go into Wednesday? 

Well, I think, you know, there was a recovery tonight. I think that the-- the mood in Europe -- we do a fair bit in Europe -- is good and they're looking to buy American stocks. I think that, you know, a lot of people came back after lunch today-- 

Yeah. 

--and took advantage of some of the discounts. The stock market and the Dow came down 600 points from the high to the low today and rallied back 100 points. 

So you're saying that some people looked at the decline yesterday and said ''There are some bargains there.'' 

There are some bargains, but it's still a pretty fully priced market on any measure over a long period of time. People still want to own stocks in this country. We are nowhere near the point in time when people don't want to own stocks. When they don't want to, the down side is much more than a few hundred points. But there's no reason not to want to own stocks today. Interest rates are low. The economy seems to be okay, maybe a little bit slower in the second half of this year than the first. And there are some values around. Some of the groups in the market-- and once again, you know, we look at companies. We don't look at the market as a whole. Some of the groups are down 30 and 40 percent and they have to be looked at. 

Where do you think it's going over the next six months? 

I think it's going to be very choppy. We've got an election. Even though there's a big difference between the two candidates in the polls, there will be uncertainty at various points in time. Greenspan is going to want to keep confidence in the equity market. Even though everyone looks to him for the bond market, I think the confidence that the Americans show in the equity market is-- is of major concern to Alan Greenspan, so he's not going to want to do anything in front of an election to really rock the equity market. 

What is it you love about investing? 

Oh, it's a great game. Trying to both find things people miss, find not just the equities, but sources of information people can't think of coming up with-- 

Yeah. 

--find ways to put money into a situation that other people can't-- and as we've gotten bigger in our investment company, the test for us is how do we buy a stock, you know, and put $30 million or $50 million or $500 million in a name without anyone knowing? That is very challenging. 

How do you do it? 

Well, sometimes, you know, you're in the market quietly. Other times, you go directly to a company and you propose a recapitalization to try and infuse money in. 

You would not invest in a company that you couldn't really get your hands around what made it and understanding how it generated its earnings. 

We will invest small amounts of money to get our feet wet. It helps us sharpen our pencils, okay? When we see an opportunity, yeah, we really want to get to understand it before we put, you know, more than 5 percent-- we own more than 5 percent of the company or-- 

When you own more than 5 percent, you have to report it, right? 

Oh, yeah. We report it. We own, you know, 30 companies of that size. We own 250 stocks in the portfolio, of which 30 or 35 are 5 percent or more. 

If you were starting over, would you do it differently? 

No. I mean, I-- I hate to tell you, I've seen a lot of people-- I've been doing this for 23 years, 21 at the same place, and this is the only way to invest. The value approach, the Graham and Dodd, Max Hynie (sp? ) kind of approach to investing-- 

Yeah. 

--is the way to go. This has much less risk and that's the hardest thing to measure about the business. Everyone looks at returns, but they can't measure risk. They measure volatility, but they don't measure risk. And what you have to do is look at 10- and 20-year periods of performance to see how much someone lost in any one quarter when it didn't do well, when the market didn't do well. That's when you start to see risk. 

And what do you think when you look at the-- the qualities that you've brought? I mean, you and your firm and your partners and the rest of the people that-- 

Right. 

--that weigh in on the decision to buy or sell-- 

Right. 

You know, I mean, what separates you, you think, from the-- that's enabled you to build up this extraordinary performance-- 

Well, we-- 

--as a mutual fund manager? 

You know, we like to see companies that-- that are very undervalued, based on asset value. But because of that undervaluation, if the earnings disappoint, they can't go down much. But we also want to see a vulnerability-- 

So you have a low down-side risk. 

We hope to have, you know, risk-reward in our favor and we like to see a vulnerability, where there's no controlling shareholder. We like to have one class of stock, so that there's not a super-voting stock that some family might control. We like to have a clean balance sheet, so we don't run financial risk. You know, we like to have the right to vote, maybe have friendly directors, maybe have a meeting where the whole board's elected. Maybe you have cumulative voting, where we can elect more than one or two directs. 

Do you like blue chips, rather than small-- 

No, we like anything. 

--growth stocks? 

We like anything. 

How important is management when you come to-- 

You know, we love-- 

--make a decision? 

--great management, but often, you know, in the case of a Motorola or a Hewlett-Packard or a Coca-Cola, they're expensive. 

Yeah. 

So, you know, what happens is poor managements might result in lower stock prices, getting the assets cheaply, so then we can go in and buy the company at much better value and either the management'll turn over, the board might do the right thing, or the management could improve. 

Why'd you sell? 

Why did I sell my firm? 

Uh-huh. 

Because it grew a lot. The world doesn't sit still. This series of funds with $17 billion needed to be in a home with a deep pocket and Franklin has a $5 billion market cap. It needed for my shareholders to have access to other products, so they'd get in one fell swoop 110 other funds that they can change into, no load, money market funds, government bond funds, hard currency funds, Templetons, foreign stock funds, emerging markets. And it gets-- 

Franklin owns-- owns Templeton, as well as-- 

Yes. They bought Templeton. 

Right. 

And what it does is it gives my shareholders a grandfathering. They never have to pay a load, even though they'll be in a load group. And they can always exchange into any of the load funds without paying a load. So they-- my current shareholders and all the people who buy my funds up until we close in October will never have to pay a sales load. But we get-- and what happens is we get a whole new exposure to most of the Americans who buy funds and they buy funds through brokers because they can't do the work themselves to figure out what fund fits their needs. If they do, maybe they make a mistake. And people bad-mouth load groups, broker-sold funds. That's not entirely appropriate. In most cases, brokers, if they're good, will help people find funds that fit their needs, not just earn the commission. And I think over time this will get the Mutual Series approach to investing out to a lot more Americans. I think in 10 years, something like 50 percent more Americans in the last 10 years own mutual funds and I will bet you that the mutual fund investors have gotten into lower reaches of society, where people are less sophisticated than they were 10 years ago about funds and about inventing, so they need brokers more. So I think now is a good time to tie up with brokers and there's a closing of the loads. You don't have to charge loads on money market funds, on 401Ks and IRAs. And financial planners and advisers won't charge loads. They'll charge a little management fee. So it will be a good marriage, I think. 

When you look at someone-- people who-- in leveraged buy-out situations-- you know, the way that KKK has done and the way-- using different kinds of financing and the way that Wurstman-Little (sp? ) has done-- 

Right. 

Does that appeal to you? 

Sometimes it does. You know, I like to buy stock in the market at no premium for control. 

Yeah. 

And I love to sell it to those guys for the control premium. 

Yeah. 

They can have it. 

Yeah. 

Every now and then-- 

A control premium is worth what, 5 percent or-- 

Yeah, 30 to 50 percent. 

Is that right? 

And it's that trigger, it's that change of control that gets us our returns. 

Yeah. 

I like to say we don't like to sell stocks, we like to fill out letters of transmittal. And a letter of transmittal is what you do when you tender your stock to one of these guys. 

Yeah. But you're not heavily invested in technology stocks. 

None. Zero. 

None. Zero. 

Zero. 

How about tobacco stocks? 

Well, tobacco's interesting. You know, I think that there's a huge opportunity for President Clinton-- you know, Bob Rubin is secretary of the Treasury. I think he has access to the Oval Office. And they can clearly call in the chairmen of the three or four major tobacco companies and reach some form of an agreement that some people threw out a few months ago along the lines of, you know, a huge fund funded by the tobacco companies out of a percentage of their earnings to fund state Medicare costs, education programs for kids and, you know, end the litigation that's tying up all the courts. 

And the tobacco companies would be responsive to that, you think. 

And Philip Morris, who leads the pack-- 

Right. 

--because they're just simply the biggest-- you know, if they had to fund whatever it is per pack, it could add up to billions of dollars, but it would eliminate this huge risk in their stock price and their stock price would go from 100 to 150, which is worth maybe, you know, $50 billion to them because they're-- they're huge cash flows. And over time-- over time, because of their international business, largely-- over time, though, I think we'd see a decrease in smoking in this country. But there's-- there's something that should be done right away because it's not working well in the courts. There's been no progress. They just go back and forth. 

And paying a lot of lawyers' fees. 

Yeah. 

And so you say bring them in there and say, ''Make a commitment that you'll spin''-- 

Some sort of global-- 

--''you'll spin off''-- 

--settlement. 

--''a certain amount of your profits to''-- and-- 

Yeah, to fund-- 

--fund and some-- 

For all the things that-- 

--purpose-- 

--need to be done-- (crosstalk) 

--in terms of entitlements-- 

Everything. 

--in terms of-- yeah. You promised your purchaser, Franklin, that you'll stay on for five years. 

Uh-huh. 

You'll stay on at least that long and-- 

Well, this is one of these things. I've been here 21 and I think I'll be involved, more or less, over the next 30. 

Yeah. 

You know, I have a terrific group of people I work with who are chomping at the bit to-- to help run the place and to run the place and I will transition in the five years to them. They're all, you know, in their-- in their own ways-- 

Yeah. (crosstalk) And is it possible that at the end of five years you'll go do something else? 

I don't know. 

You'll find out in five years. 

Yeah. 

It's great to have you. Thank you, Michael. 

Thank you very much. 

A pleasure. We'll be right back. Stay with us. July 15th marked the debut of MSNBC, a 24-hour news cable channel that brings together two communications giants, NBC News and Microsoft. This powerful combination challenges the way news will be broadcast and promises to create innovative and interactive news content. 

(? ) Microsoft is the world's software giant. 

NBC is the leaders in news. We couldn't be more excited about working with NBC. 

You take these two worldwide brand names and combine them and the results stand out as a powerhouse in the brave new media world. 

Joining me now Andrew Lack, president of NBC News, and Tom Brokaw, anchor of NBC's Nightly News and a host of Internight, one of MSNBC's primetime programs. And I'm pleased to have him here after that promo of him-- (crosstalk) 

--wherever we can get it, Charlie. We're not proud. 

You want to play it again, Charlie? 

No, I-- I think I'd like to shorten it a little bit! I mean, it went on and on and on. Tell me how this got started because you're one of the people who put it together. 

Well, it-- it's a pretty simple story. We knew for a long time -- Tom and I had even talked about it when I first came to NBC -- that the real growth in our business was getting into the 24-hour news business, that there was-- there was only so much further we could go with Nightly News, with the Today show, with Dateline. We were kind of topped out and so the dream was to get to 24 hours and-- and then we had to go find a partner to help us get-- to get that far, to-- to go that distance. And-- and Bill Gates, as it turned out, and Microsoft were-- were interested. 

Interested because it gave him an opportunity to bring the content of NBC News onto access on his-- 

Yeah, that's essentially it. 

--software. 

I think he was looking for content. You know, the old-- the old phrase -- it's becoming old in that world -- that content is king, I think, has some-- has some veracity to it. 

There is a story that he made an offer to Turner and it didn't work out. Is that-- 

I-- I don't know-- 

--true, as far as you know? 

--if it was an offer. They-- they certainly had significant conversations. I don't know that it ever got beyond that. 

The idea is to challenge CNN? 

No. No, the idea-- the idea is to get NBC News into the 24-hour business and-- and bring my colleagues our skills and talent and personalities and sensibilities on-- on the air and with-- with our Microsoft colleagues, on line. The comparisons to 

Yeah. Why do you think it's going to work? 

Oh, I think it's going to work, in part, because we're-- we're prepared well at NBC News and we have in Microsoft a very powerful partner, very aggressive, very tenacious about getting into all of this. And I think that the-- the confluence of these two interests will make us stronger than the sum of our parts, if you will. This is something that they desperately want to do because Gates has said repeatedly, you know, ''In this business, you got to grow every day or you lose.'' And one of the ways that he can grow with his company is to do just this. I mean, he-- he understands that the Internet is a powerful, new, expanding universe of news and communication retrieval on a daily basis. We can help provide the stuff that people want to provide-- retrieve, but we can also take them places that they might not be able to go just on their own on the Internet. So I think we'll do well. I-- I must say, Charlie, you'll have to believe my sincerity here-- I watched yesterday with a sense of awe because, you know, I was a participant, but these are the guys who are the architects-- 

The idea is actually-- I did, too. I mean, I must say-- 

It was very impressive. 

--I watched with a sense of awe last night. (crosstalk) 

It was very impressive. That's the best start-up I've ever seen of a new medium. It had a lot of energy. It looked good and they were intelligent and-- 

Yeah. 

It's a good thing. 

One of the things-- (crosstalk) I know, but we'll-- one of the things that it does is gives NBC News an opportunity to use its talent and its reporters and its producers and its information-gathering possibilities greater access to the public in a lot of different ways. 

Oh, in a lot of ways. It's already having a big impact in Washington. They're all watching it down there and it-- you know, now they know they've got a place to go-- 

I know. I saw Lisa Myers today doing a stand-up, doing a conversation-- 

Right. 

Right. 

--with an anchor-- 

Right. 

--about stuff that I wanted to hear about-- 

And Andrea Mitchell talking about Helms-Burton today and Ed Rabel (sp? ) and-- I mean, people are on the air because, suddenly-- you know, the politicians figured this out very quickly. There's another place to go besides CNN. And because we're off to a fast start and I think an impressive start and because a lot of people are looking in, it is going to cause what I'd call real fermentation in our news-gathering process. You know, the-- it'll-- it'll bring more things to the surface. We'll get them on the air there and we'll get them in shape for Nightly News and Today and-- so there'll be a real cross-fertilization. 

Take a look at this. This is from last night, Tom at the White House with the president. 

(MSNBC ''Internight'') We're back on Internight and we're looking, with the president of the United States, at various chat rooms on the on-line service that MSNBC is providing to all of you. How-- here's a question that came from one of the many thousands of people who submitted them. ''How will you keep the Social Security system solvent without raising taxes?'' That's on the minds of a lot of people, especially because your generation is a big bulge out there-- Pres. 

That's right. 

--and the question is, can Chelsea afford you as parents in about 10 years? I think that's the relevance of it all. Pres. 

The answer is there will probably have to be some changes in the Social Security system and what we need to do is to preserve its integrity in the same way we did in 1983. 

Tell me, Tom, what you could do last night during this interview that you couldn't do, that-- what-- 

It was very egalitarian. I mean, the-- you know, it's not just Tom Brokaw asking questions or those calls that get through. 

Yeah. 

I mean, we had 60,000 hits and 8,000 questions because not all of the hits were in question format. (crosstalk) 

What's a ''hit''? 

Well, a ''hit'' is-- means that you access-- you take a look at it and see what's going on there and they can measure that. 

Actually, you were a little better than that. You had visits. 

Right. 

''Hits'' are just-- 

Yeah. 

--literally-- 

Checking in. 

--checking in and maybe checking out instantly. 

Right. 

But we had-- 

He had visits that-- that-- they stayed. 

And we had 8,000 people fill out a form. 

Yeah. 

It was a long form. 

Right. 

And so there were questions last night from Hong Kong and from Israel and from China and from all over the world, like that, and as the president and I talked about it, it-- it really does make it a two-way street. It levels and broadens the playing field for democracy. You know, people have access to their leaders. They could sit there last night and watch that and we could take questions as they came in-- 

And-- 

--and put them to him. You can do that on the telephone. It's more expensive and this is quicker and it's a combination of all the three. So it's pretty terrific and I think, you know, then you extend it out to education and what young people will be able to do. Very remarkable. 

What's in it-- I mean, how will it play itself out? I mean, how do you see this thing evolving and growing? 

Well, really, what-- what engaged both of us in this process, and where I think the future of this network is going, is trying to reach a whole new audience of news and information junkies, if you will. There's a-- there's a generation out there and there will be generations to come that arguably will get much of their news and information-- 

Yeah. 

--from the PC, not necessarily-- (crosstalk) 

--more time there in front of a PC than they do-- 

Exactly. 

--in front of a television. 

And we've got to connect to those people. We've got to connect to that generation. We've got to get to know them. They've got to get to know us and-- and MSNBC is about that connection. It's about finding those-- those people both on line and on cable and-- and bringing them to us and a whole generation of NBC News and vice versa. You know, the-- the real-- the key word behind MSNBC and the key-- the reason Microsoft is in that title, MS, is ''interactivity.'' And what Tom was talking about, he was interacting with that audience last night in a way that I think was really pretty unusual. 

That's exactly it. 

Any reservations about getting -- quote -- ''in bed'' with a huge corporation like Microsoft? 

You mean the mild-mannered young man from-- of-- 

Yes! Yes, exactly! 

--Redmond, Washington? 

Whose wealth, as you just told me, has increased from $14 billion to $16 billion. In other words, people say he is so powerful that he absorbs and controls everything he comes in-- 

Well-- 

--touch with and he's doing it on the Internet and he's now doing it-- 

His critics say he has voracious appetite and his admirers say he's just the most skilled businessman of his time because he's out there making sure that he's not going to be attacked on any of the flanks. Sure, we have to be aware of all that, but if you're going to do business with an entity and a new technology, why not do it with the one that is the most powerful and the best? And they-- I must say that the lines of communication have been very good and we will not stop covering Microsoft or the computer industry. We're going to have to do that, as well, and they understand that. Michael Kinsley, who produces a magazine for them called Slate, in the first issue, you know, had a dialogue about ''Is''-- (crosstalk) ''Does Microsoft play fair?'' 

Right. 

And so they get that. And they aren't always going to be happy about it, understandably, but the fact is, Charlie, that this new world of telecommunications on a global basis is not done on a Mom-and-Pop budget. This is an expensive business and we have to be aware of that and it's-- you know, there are parts of me that say, ''Well, yeah, I kind of wish it were like the old days,'' but it was always expensive, from a relative point of view, and now it's just exponentially-- it's grown, in terms of its cost, and with the resources that are required to get this done and we think that they'll be a good partner. 

Can you argue that one of the partners got a better out of this deal, that-- 

No, it's 50-50. 

--Microsoft got more out of this than-- 

Up and down-- 

--NBC did? 

I don't think so. Up and down the line, it's 50-50. This was the dream for all of us, to have a 24-hour news cable operation. Microsoft has given us that and in-- and in-- and in kind, we have given back to them extraordinary material to run on-- on the MSNBC network on-line. 

You know, Charlie, I got interested in this when I began to really fully understand the magnitude of the Internet and the computer hook-up around the world and what's possible out there, watching my own children and their friends. Meredith is an active user of it. And I thought we can't let that generation and a whole segment of the population just slide away out to the Internet and retrieve what information it wants on its time without being in on it. And I also believe strongly that the Internet works best when there are gate keepers, when there are people who are making determinations and judgments about what information is relevant and factual and useful. Otherwise, it's like going to the rain forest and just seeing a green maze. You don't know what it means. And we can tell you what plant is there, what tree is there, what bird that is and why it's important and how they relate to each other. 

There was an interesting moment last night with Clinton in which you asked him whether Chelsea was a net surfer. 

Right. 

And he said not-- 

Whether he was concerned about it, right. 

--not as much because she's doing her homework. But then he took note of the fact that she is much further advanced about use of computer-- 

The best line I know about this technology-- it's the first time in the history of mankind in which the kids are teaching their parents to drive. 

It's amazing. 

Yeah. Do you expect others to follow suit? I mean, what do you expect to see-- 

I hope not! 

--on the landscape? 

I hope we're the only one doing it forever! 

You know? I mean, Fox is anxious to start a 24-hour news channel and if you watch what you guys do with a partner like Microsoft, there are other people in the software business, although not as big, nearly as big or as powerful. 

Well, I-- there-- we grew up in a world where there were always three. We were always elbowing under the basket with-- with two other fierce competitors. My guess is-- it's just a guess, but my guess is that the same will be true in the 24-hour business on cable, at least in the short term. CNN is obviously out there and has been out there for 15 years and they have an on-line service. Fox is going to get up there and they're going to do an on-line connection. So the three of us will be-- will be circling each other, trying to do the best job we can. 

In any way, does this make the Nightly News that you have been doing obsolete? 

No. I don't think-- 

You don't think-- 

I mean, over the air still delivers, in the words of a very shrewd businessman in this country, ''a lot of tonnage.'' You know, I mean-- 

Who said that? 

Warren Buffet, actually. (crosstalk) You know, it's-- we're in the volume business on over-the-air television-- 

Yeah. 

--and will be for the foreseeable future. And I think that we've pretty well established our place in the national consciousness. Now, you know, we've seen erosion, obviously, in audience share, but my God, we've expanded that spectrum by so much that there's bound to be some. We still get half the homes in America tuning in to one of the three evening news programs and I-- I would hope, not just for sentimental reasons, that that will continue because I think that a lot of people will continue to get television-- (crosstalk) 

Suppose I'm an NBC affiliate-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie, you should be so lucky. 

And all of a sudden, all over 

Yeah. 

Not going to be happy. 

Well, some of them are not too happy about it, but that-- but the-- but the concern is really a very narrow area. The concern is not with the concept of MSNBC on their part. It's not with-- with NBC News being in the 24-hour news business. They've wanted that. They've wanted it for years. With all due respect to my-- my distinguished colleagues at CNN, the NBC affiliates would rather have us than CNN 24 hours a day. The issue is Tom promoting a specific story on a specific program at a specific time and that's all-- that's going to be an awkward issue for us to resolve, but we'll get it resolved. 

Okay, here's the other question that comes you. You got Mr. Brokaw, as huge as he is. You got Bob Costas, as huge as he is. You got your stars, which you're promoting out there now as part of MSNBC. How long can they stay at MSNBC? Are they going to be a part of it forever or are they just there to get you launched-- 

No, they're-- 

--until you bring in your new-- 

They're-- they're a part of it forever because MSNBC and NBC News are one and the same. This is not a separate operation that's a satellite or an orphan or a baby or an extension. It is NBC News. The issue for Tom and for-- I don't want to speak for you on this issue, but-- but the issue is we haven't done it yet. We haven't put these programs out yet. And as we put them out and as we see how we do with them, we're going to have to make decisions about ''Will I want to do that for a while or not?'' or ''I'm going to move the-- move the chairs and the table around a little bit and-- and do something else?'' But the-- but the commitment to the channel is-- is, I think, really quite consistent with all my colleagues. I should give you the last word. 

I-- I've got an open home. I can stay. 

Is that right? (crosstalk) 

And, you know-- and the specific role in which I stay, you know, will be determined as we go along. This is an evolutionary process. We're just two days into it. We're really at an infantile stage, at the moment. I mean, we're just trying to find out who we-- who we are and we're off to a fast start. And I've been on not just with Internight, but I've been on twice in the last two days at 5:45, talking to John Gibson about stuff that we're doing on Nightly News. So we're-- we're promoting Nightly News over the air on MSNBC, as well, and I'm giving them, you know, some political perspective and that kind of thing. So there will be a lot of that and I'll appear there in ways that we cannot now anticipate, I think. 

You broke the money-- I mean, the Irvin story-- 

Yes! 

--the fact that he had plea-bargained and-- 

Good of you to point that out. Yes! 

Helms-Burton. 

--had the Holmes-Burton-- (sic) 

The Helms-Burton, right. 

--Cuba story. 

Right. 

We had the first exclusive with Steffi Graf, when she stepped down from-- had to step out of the Olympics. 

My god, this is a-- 

We had the first exclusive with Holbrooke from Sarajevo this afternoon. What people don't realize is-- 

We're up and running with MSNBC, aren't we? 

But the-- but the fact is that's not the hardest part of what we do. We've been doing that virtually every day-- 

Yeah. 

--actually, long before I arrived at NBC News, obviously. That's what these news divisions do and, in particular, that's what NBC has been doing for a quarter of a century. We just have a place now to show that we do it and know how to do it. 

I'm pleased you're there. It's great to have new people providing news. All of us who are junkies like to see more sources of news and information. John Chancellor Before I go, we're going to-- John Chancellor was a guess on this program, died, I think, over the weekend while I was away. Remember him because I want our audience to see Chancellor talking about the business that he loved. 

I don't know anyone who loved the culture of journalism more than John Chancellor did. It was part of his every waking hour and it began when he was a young man. His father told him he would be impoverished forever if he became a journalist and he said, ''I want to have an interesting life.'' And God knows he did. And he shared it up and down the organization. The youngest people would go to John and he, in a kind of fatherly way, at the end of his career, would bring them in and talk to them about how important it was to be a good journalist and the exacting standards that he set. He was with the company for more than 40 years. You know, I remember John when I was in high school and he had these little clear plastic-framed glasses and they kind of referred to him as ''the kid.'' You know, he looked like a Wall Street clerk up there posting numbers on election night. He-- 

John Chancellor-- go ahead. 

I was just going to say, but he was also-- what I-- what I always regretted is that the audience saw mostly the professorial John. He was a man of great mischief, a real bon vivant who loved to gather everybody at a table like this at the end of the day, you know, and have something stout in his glass and a big meal and tell political stories and exchange gossip and-- and have a good time. He had a robust appetite for life. 

John Chancellor, NBC News, born 1927, died 1996, stomach cancer. He was 68 years old. Here's an appearance he made on this broadcast several years ago. We remember him on this evening. (July 30, 1993) If you take the newscast, the nightly newscast that you have been so associated with, is it that much different than the newscast of 15 years ago? 

No, and that's the problem. The problem is that the world around it has changed almost completely. When I first started anchoring the news in 1970 -- not that long ago, Charlie-- 

Yes, sir, I know! 

When I first started anchoring the news, there was no all-news radio. There was no cable television. 

Right. 

Therefore, no CNN, no C-Span. There were no nationally produced newspapers, like The New York Times is printed, and The Wall Street Journal, in various parts of the country. We had practically no competition at 6:30 in the evening. Today, when those programs go on the air, the audience generally knows what I call the ''architecture'' of the day's news. They've heard it on their all-- their car radios, on all-news radio. They've seen it on CNN, which is on in many offices now. And so influence is being redefined in the United States and the three evening news programs are, I believe, not as influential as they once were, along with three big news magazines called Time, Newsweek and U.S. News. 

Nor are they as influential as they used to be. 

Nor are they as influential. So it isn't that the newscasts have changed. It's the world around them that has changed. 

When you're-- when you told your parents that you wanted to be-- that-- that it was not being a doctor nor a lawyer or a candlestick maker, but that what you wanted to be was a reporter-- 

I broke their little hearts. 

I know you did. 

Well, my father said, you know, ''It's your life.'' 

Yeah. 

''But you're-- you're condemning yourself to a life of poverty. And you're going to want to get married and raise children and you're going to have to do that in poverty.'' My mother, I think, thought it was very close to organized crime. 

Because journalists were the what? 

Well, reporters. I mean, this was Chicago. I was going in the newspaper business. 

Right. 

And-- 

And hang out with low life. 

Hanging out with low life. 

And policemen and people who-- who-- 

And-- 

--who-- who traveled in terms of the conflicts in life. 

Well, that's right, because there-- there are very few definitions of news, but the one that I've cobbled together over the years is-- 

Yeah. 

--is that news is chronicle of-- 

Yeah. 

--conflict and change. 

Yes. 

People have to know about conflict in their own society or in their own world. They have to know about change if they're going to adapt to it. Those are the two things that journalism does really well and that-- I will stand on that. My parents never really understood it, but they did understand-- I think my father really understood one-- one terrible truth about journalism and that is he thought I was getting into it because it was going to be a lot of fun. And he was right. 

Absolutely right. 

And it was many years before I found that there was also a kind of usefulness to it. It was a glorious way to begin a career. 

Define the usefulness of it. 

Oh, I think when you do carry messages of change and of conflict to people who read newspapers or magazines or watch television, when you can describe the agonies of a country going through the Civil Rights revolution that we went through in the '50s, when you can-- when you can show them the face of the Soviet, which was a pretty menacing country for many, many years during the cold war, I think that has a lot of social utility. You can go home at the end of the day and think, ''You know, I did some good today.'' And the wonderful thing about journalism is that you probably had some fun doing it. 

John Chancellor, who died at the end of last week.
