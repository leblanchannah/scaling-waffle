What is truth in politics, specifically as it applies to President Trump? Is truth dead? That is the cover story of this week "Time" magazine and managing editor Nancy Gibbs is here. "All the President's Lies" is the title of David Leonhardt's latest column in "The New York Times." He joins us now from Washington. Nancy Gibbs, tell me, where are we in this question of truth and how difficult is it for journalists? 

Journalists have been debating for a long time about when you say someone is lying, and the challenge there is that it's much easier for us to check facts. We always do that and know this statement is true, this statement is not true, this statement is partially true. When you talk about whether someone is lying, there is an added layer of intent, of, what is it that they know and believe? Are they mistaken? Are they intentionally stating a falsehood? And I think that is where this president has posed a particular challenge to the people who are covering him. A great many things that he says are demonstrably false. But there is the second question about how many of the things that he says would qualify as lies -- he knows what he is saying is false -- and how many of them are actually things that are untrue but he believes that they are true? I think separating those things is very important, because what presidents believe is enormously important in what they decide to do, what issues they care about, what wars they start, what wars they end, what challenges they face and how. So a president's knowledge and his understanding of facts, is critically important. 

And his credibility. 

And his credibility of what is it that we believe in what he says? He has made it very hard for people listening to him to believe him, because so many of the things that he has said are demonstrably untrue. 

As you said in your letter before this piece: "It is vital that we be able to believe our president. It is also vital that we know what he believes, and why. The president has made both a severe challenge." David Leonhardt, when you wrote the column that you wrote and you said, raised the question about the president as a liar, tell me how you approached that and tell me what it is that you wanted your readers to understand. 

To be honest, I approached it uneasily. I mean, it is not something that I wrote lightly and I agree with Nancy, the word "lie" is not a synonym for the word "untruth." It conveys intent, just as she said. I don't believe that George W. Bush was lying when he said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and I don't believe Barack Obama was lying when he said if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it. I think they were both careless, and I think they were both proven false. I think what we have here is a case in which the current president speaks so many untruths, just again and again and again, about the murder rate, about his own electoral margin, about the crowds during inauguration day, about JFK's assassination, about 9/11, about President Obama's birth, about President Obama's wiretapping, and I could go on with 20 more, he speaks so many untruths that I think we have to conclude that he doesn't feel bounded by truth, and so, while it is hard, probably impossible, to know on any individual case whether he knows the truth and is lying or whether he believes something that is false and is stating it, I think we can comfortably say he isn't concerned with truth. He is happy to lie, and that is what I find so alarming about the situation. 

Push comes to shove here when there is a national crisis. And the president needs for his allies, his citizens, and his government to believe him. 

We've already seen the implications of what these last few weeks have brought, and there was a poll in Germany asking people whether they think the United States is a reliable, trustworthy ally, and that number dropped precipitously from something like 59 percent who did, to 22, in a very short period of time. So there are real implications not only for what American citizens will believe from their president but what our allies will. You know, if you look back to other critical moments in American history, think about the Cuban missile crisis, when President Kennedy has to go on television and state to the country that this tremendous threat was now facing the country, and the people thought we might be looking at the possibility of a nuclear exchange, the stakes of presidential credibility in a case like that could not possibly be higher. Similarly, when he went to our allies and told them about what our intelligence was finding, it was critical that our allies believed him and that he had not in any way doctored or exaggerated the evidence. 

You are an editor and a reporter, not a psychiatrist, but let me ask you this, why does he do it? 

Well, all we can judge is what we see and what he says to us, and when we interviewed him this week on exactly this subject, I think, to go to what David was raising is he doesn't view truth, I think, in the way, or treat it in the way we are accustomed to in our public figures, or for that matter, in private figures. It's much more of a transaction. And so in a number of cases where we pressed him on exactly these false statements, it was as though the truth itself was something that was negotiable or something where, okay, I haven't been proven right yet but I will be. So he cited, for instance, his statement about this terrible thing that happened last night in Sweden. Well, nothing had happened the night before in Sweden. But he said, yes, but two days later, there were these terrible riots. As though truth doesn't matter so much if you're a prophet and you can see what's going to happen in the future. He talked in any number of cases about times when he said things that were ridiculed in the moment where he turned out to be right. He cited Brexit over and over again. He cited the fact that he is the president of the United States over and over again where a great many people said a great many times that that could never happen. And if fact, he ended the interview saying, well, I can't be doing that badly because I'm the president and you're not. 

But does he understand the significance of credibility, is the question? 

It's not clear that it has ever mattered because as he, himself, has said -- 

He was in real estate. 

You know, he talked about truthful hyperbole. He talked about playing to people's fantasies, that, in his life, and what has worked for him -- and it's human nature that if something works for you, you're more likely to keep doing it -- if it has worked for him to invent, or exaggerate, or distort, then that has been validated over and over, in his experience, as something that is an effective tactic. I think a great many people who even knew this about his business career did not expect it was a behavior that would follow him into the Oval Office where the stakes of his statements are so much higher and yet that's what we're seeing. 

In a transactional analysis you can move the goal post and you can say whatever I said is simply to begin the negotiations. 

Right, right. 

David, so how does this change? If all this is at stake, the credibility of the President of the United States, and there is a record, as you suggested, the current president has lied, he lied in ways that no American politician ever has before, and then you cite the things that he's lied about. Does it have to stop? And if it doesn't stop, what then? 

It's a good question, and obviously, it's alarming, right, because, for many reasons, Americans, whether they are Republican or Democrat or Independent, should be rooting for a presidency that is functioning well because many things depend on it. The safety of our country depends on it, the health of our society depends on it, and so it really is quite alarming. I think there are a few possibilities here. Nancy just basically said that one of the reasons it's likely he does this is because it's worked for him. It worked for him in business. His company basically collapsed but it was too big to fail and so his creditors decided it was better to keep the name going than to put him out of business. And then it worked in the campaign. He told a huge number of lies during the campaign, provably false things, and he was elected president. And so I think one of the issues is, if it starts to not work for him, if he can't get things through Congress, if Republicans start to abandon him, if his approval ratings remain low, then there is the question of does he look at this and say, wait a second, this is hurting me, and does he change his course? That's an amoral way to start telling the truth, but it might be the best we can hope for. 

Another tenet of his belief is there are winners and losers and he wants to be a winner. And so then you raised the question of what is he prepared to recognize and do in the interest of being a winner? 

Well, there are some things that I'm not sure we have ever seen in his entire public life. I don't think we've seen him admit error, I don't think we've seen him apologize, I don't think we've seen him express shame or remorse or regret, all of which are perfectly human functions that most people do quite normally in the course of their lives. And so whether or not -- I think it's quite true that if he feels like he is paying a significant cost, that it would be logical for him to change course, unless it just, it isn't in him. We don't know if the truth is in him. 

You worry that somehow in the world that we live in, falsehood has taken a new power. 

Well, that is a really important part of this conversation because one of the things we studied, he has Tweeted 298 times since taking office, and over this period of time, and if you look at which of his Tweets have been most re-tweeted and most covered, it is the most outrageous ones. And what social scientists find is that even when a false statement is repeated often enough, the number of people who believe it tends to grow. And some of this is confirmation bias and some of this is what people are increasingly concerned about part of the intrusion into the electoral process where the hacking of social media in order to promote false stories, and the more they were promoted, the more people saw them, the more the number of people believed them. We even saw this with the original sin in terms of Trump's falsehoods which was the birther controversy. 

Sure. 

That the more that controversy was covered, including reporters disputing and debunking it, the more the number of people who believed it grew. You know, I always wondered why was it that President Obama ultimately felt like he had to produce that long form? 

Of which Donald Trump took credit for. 

Yes. Why would he give Trump what he wanted? Well, partly because the polling showed that the longer this went on, the more people who were believing it, even though the stories they were reading overwhelmingly were stories that knocked the conspiracy theory down. 

Social media is with us and is not going to change, is it? 

No. 

David? 

Some of this, Charlie, is a reflection of the partisan polarization we have in our society. So it's not just that when people hear a lie, they tend to believe it. It's that when people hear something coming from the other side of the political spectrum, they tend to disbelieve it. And so having the so-called mainstream media which obviously all of us are members of, debunk falsehoods from Donald Trump may actually cause a segment of the population to believe those falsehoods even more. 

Because we tried to debunk them? 

Yes, because we are the ones doing the debunking. And so one of the costs of partisan polarization is that people stop listening to each other and they just say, wait a second, is the person saying that my ally or not, and if they're not my ally, I not only am going to be skeptical, I'm actively not going to believe them. 

This may be naive, but where is patriotism here? 

I mean, you would hope that we -- and not only would you hope, I know there are people who have gone into the Trump administration, who are horrified by watching their boss, the president of the United States, say patently untrue things. And so what you would hope is that one of the roles that patriotism plays is that members of Congress who are supposed to be members of a co-equal branch of government. And, so far, many House Republicans have not been, they've acted like Trump staffers on things like Russia, you would hope that Republican senators, Republicans in the House more so than they have, and even members of the Trump administration would say that patriotism and national interest outweighs party loyalty and even their loyalty to any one individual and that they would be willing, first behind closed doors, to try to push the president back toward reality. And secondly, when he won't do that, to speak up against him. 

We've seen an interesting week. We've seen an FBI director say I've seen no evidence that President Obama's administration bugged Trump Tower. We've seen a confirmation hearing of a Supreme Court justice and we've seen a debate about health care. Will we look back and see this as a defining week in the Trump presidency? 

In any other age, anyone in our positions would say, yes, of course, and, yet, we have been living through the last year and a half in which day after day and week after week, takes us into territory for which there are no maps. 

How many times have we all said, that's it, he can't go further than this? 

And so I long ago got out of the prediction business about just where this is going to be taking us. 

David? 

This is probably a mistake. Nancy's answer is the right answer, but I'll make the mistake, which is, if in fact this health care bill fails, I do think there is a substantial chance we'll look at this as a significant week in the life of the Trump presidency. To have your first priority fail when your party controls Congress is a very, very damaging thing to have happen. It happened to Bill Clinton in 1993, and it really damaged his presidency. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama got their first priority through. If Donald Trump and the Republicans cannot pass health care despite having spent years promising to do so, despite controlling the House, to me, it will be a sign that some of these issues with the president, his lack of connection to the truth, his inexperience in politics, his lack of interest in policy and in detail, may, in fact, cause him substantial problems as president. 

It also is a reflection of the danger of promising things that most people believe are contradictory and cannot be achieved. 

That's exactly right. I mean, the Republicans don't have a coherent policy on health care. They can come out and say, look, we don't think government should be in the business of health care and it's fine if many, many more people are uninsured. There are all kinds of things they could say. But what they essentially did was they painted Obamacare as a socialist bill, when in fact, it's quite moderate and they left themselves no place to go. The only place they had to go is the place where they were uninsuring large numbers of people and that's really their problem here, exactly as you said, they promised vastly more than they could deliver. 

And many of those large number of people have voted for them either at the state level or had voted for the president. 

Precisely. 

Well, we're going to be watching the natural political calculation of, you know, who do I answer to if I'm a member of Congress, is it the people in my district or is it the leadership of my caucus or is it the president of the United States if he's a member of my own party, and how much power does he have to do me damage down the road? And I think that's what we'll be watching play out. And the fact, to go back to your question, that all of these things are happening within the same sort of news cycle and ecosystem of, you know, how strong the president is and how strong he's perceived as being, perhaps more important, is he the guy who can get the deal done or not? I think, you know, this is a critically important moment and yet here we are, you know, 60 days into a presidency. 

60 days! 

And we have to keep reminding ourselves of that, it's 60 days. 

With many careers on the line. Time" magazine, "Is Truth Dead? Nancy Gibbs, thank you so much.
