Mandy Patinkin is here. As an actor, you know him for his roles as Inigo Montoya in "The Princess Bride" and Saul Berenson in the hit Showtime series "Homeland." He is also often seen on concert stages and in the theater here in New York. What you may not know is that after production wrapped on the fifth and sixth season of "Homeland," he traveled to the refugee route in Europe to help the International Rescue Committee with the ongoing humanitarian crisis there. This year, he and his wife, Kathryn, visited refugee camps in Lesbos, Greece, and Serbia, along the Croatian border. In Germany, Patinkin reconnected with the Alassys family, whom he first met at a refugee camp in 2015, shortly after they escaped their native Syria. Here is a look at their reunion. (MUSIC) I'm pleased to have Mandy Patinkin back at this table to talk about this issue. Just talk about what we just saw. 

All right. Such a beautiful family. There they were, they got off the boat in Lesbos. They lost everything in the water, and didn't know what to do. They were stranded. I was able to help them get on the ferry and get to the train to go on the route and come to Germany and have this beautiful home. Their boys are in school. And right next to their house, I said, is this the school, to Koder, who is the father, Safe is the mother. I love that her name is Safe, spelled S-A-F-E. 

Yes. 

They said, no, it's not a school. It's an old-age home. Toward the end of our visit, I said to Koder, because in Germany, they let you study German for two years, the grownups before they require you to get a job. Here it's a little different. And he said, no, it's not a school, it's an old-age home. And I said -- and he's a decorator, so he did his kitchen, he made that whole house so beautiful. And I said, Koder, when you finish your school for two years and you're ready to get back in the workforce, are you going to be a decorator? Are you gonna be an architect? He said, no, I want to work for the elderly, to take care of the elderly, that is my dream. 

That says who he is. 

That's what I did for my father, he said. That's who these people are. They're just the most extraordinary. 

In the same vein, Mandy Patinkin, everybody would like to have him on their side. Why refugees? What was it about these people that caused you to, every time you finished "Homeland," to take the first flight out to go visit? 

Yes. It's my family. These are my -- it's my grandpa Max, my grandma Celia, Kathryn's grandma Masha, it's our ancestors. It's all of America's ancestors. 

They were refugees? 

Yes, they were refugees. They left Poland, America opened their arms and welcomed them. You're here because your ancestors were welcomed. All of America is the product of this country welcoming most people except for Native Americans, which is certainly its own story; and African-Americans which is a very different story. But the rest, we're here because people were kind and generous and empathetic to the suffering that our ancestors experienced and the suffering that these people are experiencing all over the world. The six-year war in Syria is overwhelming. It's, you know, to be awakened by the horrible images that we've all seen in this past week with the gas attack. I'm grateful that people are awakened, but why isn't it just as awakening to see children washing up on the beach, who thousands have drowned in trying to get from Turkey to Lesbos, Greece, and trying to get through their journey? Why isn't it enough of a -- if you're so concerned for the children, which you well should be, then we need to find legal options for these most vulnerable among us, these refugees who are fleeing this war, trying to find sanctuary in a third country? We need to give them legal options. And we have to stop these bans. These bans create havoc on the emotional landscape of their lives. 11,000 refugees, right now, are waiting to come to America, who have already been through the most rigorous vetting process imaginable. The United States of America is -- and I have studied this -- is the gold standard of vetting. It is an 18-month to two-year process. You do not even get in the door to be vetted unless the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commission of Refugees, feels that you as an individual or a family can make it through this 18-month to two-year process, only then do you begin it. And then it never ends. You are vetted when you get on the plane, when you get off, a year later for your green card, five years later for citizenship, and the rest of your life. So the fact of the matter is, the refugee community in the United States -- since 1975, three million refugees have come here; since 9/11, 900,000; not a single terrorist incident has taken place by a refugee in the United States. These are the safest people among us. And we must know that. And we must encourage our leaders, our members of Congress, Senate, our president, not just in America but all over the world, to know the truth and the facts, and what I gave you are the facts. And that they are not dangerous and of course you can improve the vetting process for the rest of time. 

How do you inform the political process so that political decisions are not made that make it more difficult especially if you come from six designated countries? 

It's up to the voter and the citizenship. You have to understand the power you have to influence your congressman, senator, your president. You make calls to your representatives. You tell them that you want the foreign aid and the domestic aid not to be cut as the new budget proposes. That that aid being cut will cut the opportunities to resettle these people in America and the opportunity just to keep them alive right now in these other countries. You need to know that this is trumped up fear to get your vote. It's the oldest trick in the book. If I tell you who to be afraid of and I vilify a people -- and in this case it's the Muslim population, a population that has made a world contribution over time that is monumental, and yet, we have vilified them to make people terrified. And if I have you frightened enough of them and I tell you, you vote for me, I'll keep you safe. And I've just given you the facts that they are the most vetted people. Before President Trump was inaugurated, Obama asked for 110,000 refugees to come in, and that's worldwide. That's not just Syria. Worldwide refugees. Kicked it up to 110,000. Trump was inaugurated, they brought it down to 50,000. I asked the administration to reconsider that since they're now awakened, thank God, about the necessity for the attention these children and families need. 

Because of the photographs they saw this week? 

Because of photographs they saw this week. And re-look at these other photographs. And I have said a number of times, before President Trump was a New Yorker and gone to military school or whatever school he went to, a businessman, a billionaire, a politician, and now president, he's a human being. 

With children. 

With children. And I am certain that that humanity which was ignited by those photographs the other day, that if he saw or came with us to these camps and met these children that I have met and talked to and been with, his heart would be overwhelmed with compassion and empathy. It's impossible to be alive, a breathing human being and not have that happen. He had that happen to him. And it is so important that as I talked to my colleagues at the International Rescue Committee, now that that door has been opened, it is necessary for diplomacy to just explode everywhere. That effort has to be redoubled over and over and over again. 

And your mission is? 

To stop the conflict. That's the key. Stop the conflict. Stop the killing. But first and foremost, bring aid and help to these people. Create legal options. Let the United States be the guide and teacher to the countries in Europe. Germany is doing far more than their share, but countries in the European Union like Greece are so overwhelmed economically and they're doing the lion's share of the work. Serbia, who's not even in the European Union -- 

And with some political opposition, as you know. 

A great deal. A great deal. But we need to work together to help the European community improve their vetting process. Germany has a decent process, they're doing their best. That process can always be made better. But don't say that American citizens are in danger. I have a dear friend who is one of the highest people in the evangelical community who says he meets his constituents in Oklahoma who cry, who are weeping, grownups who are weeping, terrified that my head's going to be cut off. That's what they think, and it's not true. It's fake, false information. It is trumped up to make you terrified so that you get my vote. It happens through history all the time. Learn that. And learn the facts. And then call your representatives and say, I want these people taken care of, I want the walls to come down in our cities, I want to welcome these families to our country. And then as individuals, what else can you do aside from, you know, your constituents to let them know which ones just in America? There are 28 centers for refugee resettlement in the United States run by the IRC. Call one of them, all over the country, call one of them. Invite this family to your community, to your house, your church, your synagogue, your mosque, your temple. Invite them to your school, your PTA meeting, have them over for dinner, have a play date with your kids. Can you imagine how they'll feel when you listen to their story and listen to them? Whatever the language barrier is, have some understanding how hard they're working. These people are -- they're not just, you know, people who are struggling so hard. Some of them are great scientists and students and doctors and lawyers and their careers have been wiped out from under them. 

I want to show you -- we got some pictures in. I wanted for the audience to see them, just to see the faces of the refugee world. What's this? 

That is a Farhad Nouri. A 10-year-old, extraordinarily, naturally gifted artist who's never had a single lesson in his life. And I took him outside on a bench in Belgrade, Serbia. And we did a little Facebook interview. Because I never have been on social media, my kids said dad, if you want to get the word out, you got to get on the program here. So please go to Mandy Patinkin's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and meet these people, see what they had to say, videos we put together like this. I said to Farhad at the end, I said, you know, hopefully people will see this conversation we are having, Farhad. Is there something you want them to hear? And Farhad said, yes, I would like them to know kindness, not just for me, he said, but for refugees everywhere. We need kindness. From the mouths of babes. 

Second picture? 

That's my wife, Kathryn and I, in Kara Tepe, which is now paved. Those containers were not there a year ago in 2015 when I went there. It was dirt roads and tents. It has improved because unfortunately that's as good a refugee resettlement camp you might find anywhere in the world. But it needs to be put out of business. It has improved because it is no longer a transfer station for 5,000 or 9,000 people a day on the journey, it's possibly -- 

You want to get them resettled as soon as possible. 

They may have to be there for God knows how long. So now they trying to -- now they need funding and donations from all of these organizations. You know, ask how you can help, you can donate to these organizations because they may now have to set up education programs, women's care programs, human rights programs, LGBTQ, and all the way down the list. 

Continuing. 

That is Farhad Faez. 

Yes. 

Who is 13 years old. Learned impeccable English in ten months. My wife said to him after he told us his story and he went through the woods and the jungle in the night. And I said to him, were you afraid in this journey while you are going at night to get to the Turkish border? He said, of animals and things in the dark? He said no, only at the police. 

Yes. 

That they would pull them back. My wife gave him a journal because she said when he finished talking, she said, you are going to be a statesman, Farhad. The way you articulate your people's journey and life, you need to write the story down, so I'm going to get you a journal so you can begin writing. He said to me later in the day, I like what your wife said to me, I'm going to do that. 

This one? 

That is Faraz, a beautiful 18-year-old woman who has a three-month-old baby, and she we wept, speaking to my wife and myself, fought to talk to us. She taught Farhad. She is Farhad Faez's English teacher. And she found us later with the camera and said, I want to tell my story. And she talked about how people had violated her along her journey, but she was very careful to say but there are good people here, too. And in tears and choking out her words, she said, all I want is an education for myself and my children. Can you please do that? And my wife and I, because there are no legal options, we looked at each other, and we didn't want to lie to her, give her false hope. So we just said to her, which we say to these people right now, if you are here, you have a kind of strength and resistance that is something we're not even familiar with where I come from. And that strength has brought you to this moment. And I'm sure you will find a way to survive this and have the life you desire. But that life depends on the world community listening and helping these people. I went there to accumulate their stories, film them, put them down on my notes with photographs, so that I could share their stories with the world, so people will help. 

Two more photographs here. Some of the same people we've seen. 

Hanife and Attife in Kara Tepe in their container. These two girls, nine and eleven. One wants to be a pediatrician, the other one wants to be a teacher. And they both said to me, we went through the Iranian mountains to get to where we were going at night and we had snow up to our necks. 

And the final, this last slide. 

That is Abid, who grabbed my beard on the street in Serbia, near the Croatian border, and said, grandpa, you are grandpa. And then he brought us to meet his whole family. And all the kids said, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a lawyer, I want to help children, I want to help people that are hurt in the war. I looked at my wife. There's a small video, one of the videos on our site. I said, you know, honey, this has been overwhelming, hearing all these stories. And listening to people, hoping that we can do something by sharing their stories. I said, but, you know, I said you know what I'm thinking? She says, I know what you're thinking. I said, this has also been one of the great days of my life. She says, I know why. I said, because Abid made me a grandpa. I said my own kids who are 33 and 34, I am not pressuring them, but they didn't -- I had to come to a refugee camp in Syria to be made a grandpa. 

Thank you, my friend. 

Thank you. 

For all the people you're trying to help to tell the story. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
