And we conclude this evening with Russia. It is perhaps the biggest foreign policy uncertainty facing the Trump administration. Representative Darrell Issa of California has called for a special prosecutor to investigate reported communications between Russians and the Trump campaign. Meanwhile, President Trump rejected reports of his ties to Russia in a tweet yesterday. He called it fake news put out by the democrats and played up by the media. Joining me from Washington D.C. is Evan Osnos of "The New Yorker." He and his colleagues analyze Russia's relationship with the Trump administration in a new cover article titled "Active Measures." And here in New York, Julia Ioffe of "The Atlantic." She covers politics and world affairs and focuses on Russia. I'm pleased to have both of them on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

So, Evan, your cover, great piece, I think a lot of people glad you wrote it, probably not the Trump administration. What surprises you most when you look at the amount of confrontation that you see between the United States and Russia, in this piece you really unpack what the Russians have been up to, particularly in asymmetric warfare against the U.S. and increasingly the west. What coming into this piece you wouldn't have expected now that it's out? 

This piece which really was a collaboration with David Remnick and Joshua Yaffa in Moscow was an attempt to try to say, what is actually going on right now in the U.S.-Russia relationship? I think frankly for a lot of Americans, this was off the radar screen for the last few years. People weren't paying that much attention. But in Moscow, it turns out in fact there was a lot of attention on where Washington was going and on the nature of how these two countries were going to deal with each other. And what we've learned and I think we are gonna learn a lot more is that really since Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, he has been, what's been described to us by U.S. officials and others, as on a fairly active footing towards a more hostile, more confrontational relationship with the United States. He believes that the United States has sought to try to undermine his own domestic politics, his own political stability, and therefore he undertook measures, we're now told, that would seek to undermine the legitimacy of our election here and indeed to promote one candidate, Donald Trump over his opponent, Hillary Clinton. 

And so were you surprised that the U.S. response given that under President Obama was as late and as weak as it turned out to be? 

Yeah, it is basically recognized now both from people who were in that White House, in the Obama White House, and then also others in Hillary Clinton's campaign and elsewhere in the intelligence community that the response was muted and it was probably more muted than it should have been. Because the United States, look, the White House knew as of the summer of to 2016 that there was a serious and sustained effort to try to undermine the legitimacy of this election. And the White House chose not to as one Hillary Clinton advisor put it, declare this a five alarm fire. The president came out in October. He said this is a Russian effort. He acknowledged it. He said we're gonna do something about it. But it was not treated in the way that some people might have wanted which was to go out in front of the nation and say our democratic institutions are under attack. The argument you will hear which is a credible argument from the White House at that point was look, we believe that the important thing was to get through this election without further escalation on the Russian side, without them actually trying to tamper with the votes in the ballot boxes, and we believe that we could bring them to heal, in effect. But I think in retrospect now that the intelligence community and law enforcement community are beginning to really get their arms around the contours, the full scale of this operation, there is a feeling that the response was perhaps too little and too late. 

Julia, that is what you hear from Washington. What do you hear from Moscow is the Americans do this sort of thing all the time, right? I mean, we undermine governments. A lot of hypocrisy here. Is this a five-alarm fire or are we making too much out of mutual antagonism? 

I think this is a multiple alarm fire and, you know, from Moscow's point of view, there certainly is a lot of hypocrisy, right? They saw even what happened on the Maidan in Kiev in 2013, 2014 as a U.S. effort to more regime change in the region. And that it was, you know, it had started in Iraq and had crawled closer and closer to Putin's borders and had even gone into Russian borders itself. I think Putin really believes and people around him really believe that the pro-democracy protests of the winter of 2011, 2012, were another American orchestrated effort to oust Putin from power. I found what Evan said really true that, you know, the fact that we weren't paying attention to Moscow here was part of the problem. You know, I remember I was in Moscow when Mitt Romney who was then running for president in 2012 said Russia was America's number one geopolitical foe. 

Laughed off the stage pretty much. 

He was laughed off the stage here. And I remember laughing it off in Moscow. And I remember even liberal Russians being kind of offended by that, you know, because they have all these shows that covered, you know, what is the American media say about Russia? Whole hours dedicated to unpacking what we say about them. And they so want to know what we think about them. And to be told that we don't think about them much at all was really insulting. You know, especially, you know, people still remember the Soviet Union when it was, you know, they were going blow for blow with the Americans, so this was the fact that they were ignored and kind of disrespected and treated like a bit player, you know, Obama called them a fading regional power. What I have heard from American officials who have dealt with the Russians was that they were constantly hearing these gripes from the Russians even from Putin himself, who'd just go on for, you know, forever with this, you know, you guys are disrespectful, you don't respect us, you don't treat us with the respect we feel we deserve. You know, there is a lot of wounded ego there. 

I mean, Evan, one thing that came across from this piece is that Putin and the Kremlin seems to be pretty mono maniacal in their focus on the United States. How much do you think that is unique to this administration? In other words, are we talking about a tale of two individuals and, you know, you bring some new people in from the U.S. perspective it's not as bad, and if it hadn't been Putin, even though he's really popular in Russia, this might have played out differently? 

I think that this intelligence operation, which is really what it was, can only be understood in the context of Vladimir Putin's origins, where he came from. This is a man who after all when the Berlin Wall was coming down, he was in the basement of an intelligence office in Berlin shredding documents. He was a person who was an utter -- an agent ultimately of an idea, which was the notion of Soviet empire and what the Russian people could and should accomplish in the world. And then he watched over the course of the next two decades as Russia gradually erode -- lost its position in the world as a leading superpower and was reduced ultimately, as Julia rightly said, to a point where Barack Obama could describe it as a regional power. And he was in effect sort of beset in his view by the growth of NATO, by the power of the United States. And so what evolved was really an outgrowth of a longstanding tradition in Soviet intelligence was the idea of "Active Measures," that is where the title of this piece comes from, which is that, you know, espionage is traditionally about the collection of foreign secrets, about trying to understand and anticipate events based on things that foreign powers don't want you to know. And then there is something else, which is a kind of covert action, which is involved in actually trying to influence events. And that is what "Active Measures" were and in this case what we saw was an active attempt to try to shift the course of American political events. And it succeeded, frankly, to a degree that I think the Russian side really didn't thoroughly anticipate. If you talk to -- if you talk to the American intelligence officials who are focused on these issues, they'll tell you that this seems to have "succeeded" beyond a level that the Russian side really ever imagined. 

Do you think that success here is that we're all paying attention to Russia for this or is success something deeper? Do you think that it showed a level of American vulnerability that people hadn't been aware of? 

Well, I think, you know, Putin, look, this is the difference between the Russians and the Americans. The Americans, unlike many other world powers, are perfectionists. They think there is a fix it solution to every problem. The Russians don't think that way. They don't need a perfect solution to something. They don't need to elect a specific candidate. No matter who won in November 2016, the fact that Vladimir Putin was the major topic of discussion of pretty much every Republican debate and was the subject of the presidential debates in the general election, he won. If Hillary Clinton won as they expected her to, she would have come in delegitimized, badly hobbled by all these leaks and revelations and stories that she was dying of Parkinson's and pneumonia and whatever else she had, they would have won. The fact that they got Trump unexpectedly, they won. If Trump goes down in flames in the next four years and is impeached and removed from office or is, you know, badly delegitimized in the office, they still win because it undermines the whole enterprise of American liberal democracy. And this goes back again to what Evan was saying when Vladimir Putin was in Dresden, he was actually in eastern Germany in Dresden. 

Right. 

And after 1991, at the end of the Cold War, right, the Cold War was a battle of ideologies. It was Soviet communism versus, you know, western transatlantic liberal democracy. At the end of the Cold War, the consensus was transatlantic western-style liberal democracy, representative democracy is the better, more moral, more effective, more efficient way to govern people. Vladimir Putin never agreed with that. And he has been very consistent saying there is no one size fits all way to rule countries. And this doesn't fit us. We don't want to be ruled this way. You think you are so much more moral, more ethical than us, that's not true. And so part of the goal here has also been to keep his own people from striving to achieve the western model of democracy. To keep people and to keep countries that were in the former Soviet sphere, who were former Soviet republics like Georgia, like the Baltics, like Ukraine, from striving to be part of the west, striving to build their governments and their societies like western governments and societies. And by delegitimizing the west and saying look how chaotic, they are just as chaotic and corrupt as we are, so why would you want to be like them? 

Look, it's interesting. On one hand, you can say he has been vastly successful in getting the world to say not a great western model out there and much more relativism. On the other hand, when you look at Russia itself and you look at their lack of economic growth and opportunity and the feeling within Russia that greatness is something that is really well, well beyond, I mean make a country great again, Russia is the one that in principle is in most dire need of such a slogan. How does -- how do they balance that? 

I don't think Russians see it that way. I think, you know, for me, a really eye opening text was Svetlana Alexievich's "Secondhand Time" which won the Nobel Prize last year for literature. 

Talking to all of these Gorbachev-era and earlier pensioners living their lives. 

Well, she's just saying over two decades talking to Russians about basically the effect of the Soviet collapse on their lives. And what you see is just this massive spiritual vacuum and how important it is. And you see people in that book who participated in horrible atrocities who were victims of atrocities. Nonetheless, miss the Soviet Union because otherwise, what was the point of it all? Russians are a lot like Americans. And they are more like Americans than Americans want to admit. They need an organizing principle and motivating idea and ideology to feel like their lives make sense. For most of Russian history, whether it has been under the Tsars or under Putin or under the Soviet general secretaries, it has been empire. And it is not coincidence that after Vladimir Putin came back for his third term in 2012 that the word empire made a big resurgence in the media and just, you know, conversations that I had with Russians, they would say, well, you know, at least we live in an empire. I would say like do you get more milk, do you get more bread because you live in an empire? They spiritually need it and are willing to take an economic hit for it. So when you have Deputy Prime Minister Dmitryi Olegovich who is in charge of the space program say you know, Russians will tighten their belts for a great cause. And, you know, next we're going to colonize the moon, he has a point. Russians are willing to take -- no one knows where the bottom is with Russians, but they are willing, especially when the decline is slow and not precipitous, they're willing to take a hit economically for a larger idea. 

So Evan, where do you think this goes? 

I think the first step in figuring out what the ultimate strategic consequences are in terms of the U.S.-Russia relationship, the first step really is to understand exactly what happened here. And that's why the center of the action right now is in the intelligence and the law enforcement community and also on the Hill. The Senate is beginning to realize that there are serious questions here. We're at the beginning of this inquiry. We're not at the end. And so what is going to happen, I think you are beginning to see with Darrell Issa's comments about perhaps the need for a special prosecutor, is that members of the legislative branch are discovering that in order for us to make smart choices about our own future with Russia. We have to understand exactly what happened in this election, not just who hacked the DNC and John Podesta's email or who was generating propaganda and what is known as an influence campaign, but also what was, in fact, the level of contact between Russian representatives and elements of our political system, perhaps even Donald Trump's campaign? In order for us to do that there has to be a thorough and robust inquiry. And only at that point I think will you find that people who really -- remember, the Republican Party has traditionally stood for very strong national defense. They're the ones who will want to know exactly what Russia did to us so that we can prevent something like this from happening both to our own political system and also to the political systems of our allies because you have elections coming up this year in a number of states that already discovered that there is Russian interference. And I think we are going to begin to know more once we get to a really transparent and robust inquiry into the full scale of Russian interference in the United States. 

Julia, do you think that the Russians understand that they might have overplayed their hand here in the sense that now it's going to be much harder for them to get anything going with the Trump administration because of this extraordinary focus? 

You know, I think part of the point as Evan and his colleagues point out in the article is to be overt about it. You know, it's to let us know that they can do this. It's analogous to FSB agents coming into the homes of western diplomats and journalists stationed in Moscow rearranging their furniture, leaving all the windows open in the middle of winter. They want you to know they were there. They want to be brazen about it, that is part of the point, to show us that they can. 

They want sanctions off from Europe too, this makes it much harder to bring that about, right? 

Yeah, it might. But I think there are other goals that they have. You know, part of it is also just, sanctions haven't been as much of a hit on the Russian economy as we like to think. Oil was the major hit. And with that, they've been able to pull off other maneuvers like through their intervention in Syria, negotiate a deal with OPEC that lowers production, raises oil prices, that helps them. So I think they're going to be okay even if sanctions don't get lifted. Also the Trump administration doesn't have to formally lift sanctions. They can, you know, ease up on enforcing them. There are all kinds of ways to get around it. And Russia can get other things done. A key point of what Evan said, you know, part of the reason that it's been moving so fast and it has been so hard for the west to respond, on one hand, you have what, in this excellent New Yorker piece, you have I think a defector from the KGB in the west saying, you know, this is -- western societies are fundamentally vulnerable to this. And in this way the Russians are like the 9/11 hijackers. They found a loophole, they used the openness of western society as a weapon against. 

I love that analogy by the way. (LAUGHTER) 

And the other thing is that the reason it is so -- our response is so ad hoc is the Russians approach is very ad hoc. You know, I think the hacking campaign and the influence campaign and the selection from what I have learned from the Russian and the American side is it was very ad hoc and opportunistic. It started off as one thing and then began, developed into something else. You know, they hacked into the DNC servers and while they were in there, they found out it was communicating with the DCCC servers, the congressional committee, and so they went in there. And, you know, so it was -- they are evolving quite rapidly themselves, too. So it is kind of like playing whack-a-mole. 

So, Evan, last question to you. Everyone says that Putin is such an extraordinary chess player. But what I am hearing is that actually you know, the trade craft is extraordinary. The checkers play is great. But is there a long-term actual strategy here in your view? Do they know the car that they're trying to catch? Do they know what they're going to do with it when they catch it? 

My own view based on the reporting from talking to people who are as deeply involved in this as they can be is that this was an improvisation. I think Julia's description is exactly right. That this was an attempt to exploit an opportunity in American political culture. In some ways, they didn't hack the vote. They hacked the voter. They figured out a way that they could get into our politics and monkey around which is really the part, that is the heart of "Active Measures," is to create a degree of chaos. To create a degree of turmoil. It doesn't require that you have a coherent, plausible, obtainable objective. I think at this point the idea that Russia is going to successfully undermine the democracy of the United States is a long shot, but what they have done, is forced us to take stock of what happened just the same way that we took stock of what happened after 9/11. And really require us to say look, okay, now let's enlist this democratic system that we got, the legislative branch, the courts, and to some degree the executive branch and figure out what exactly happened, why are we vulnerable, and what are we going to do to prevent it from happening again? 

Evan Osnos, Julia Ioffe, thank you very much. 

Thanks, Ian.
