Here is Gary Clark, Jr. performing "The Healing" right here in our studio. (MUSIC) (SINGING) I got something in motion... Something you can't see... It requires devotion... From those who truly believe... This is something you can't touch... This is something you feel... For some people, it's too much... For some people, it heals... This music is my healing... This music is my healing... Lord knows I need some healing... (MUSIC) When this world upsets me... This music sets me free, yeah... I know, I know... (MUSIC) We stand in formation... While they test and they see... They compile information... And try to make us believe... That there is something we can't touch... Something we'll never feel... When I feel like it's too much... This music always reveals... This is our healing... This music is our healing... Lord knows we need some healing, yeah... When this world upsets me... This music sets me free... God only knows who will save us... Who will save us now... They sit back and watch flowers turn to stone... (MUSIC) We got this music healing... We got this music, yeah... We got this music, yeah... Can't take it away, no, no, no... (MUSIC) I'm pleased to have Gary Clark, Jr. at this table for the first time, welcome. 

Thank you. Pleasure to be here. 

So the idea of the chosen, where did that come from? 

I am not quite sure. I think that first popped up in a "Rolling Stone" piece or something like that. I saw it. I better get it together. 

They also call you a musical ambassador. That somehow you are an ambassador for the blues for sure. 

That's something that I am starting to embrace a little bit more, I would say. Become older and understand really what I think my role is musically. I mean, I try and do a lot of things but I've definitely been in spots and positions and been looked upon or called upon by other artists to kind of carry on a tradition in blues music and music rooted in, you know, blues. And it's been a little bit overwhelming and sometimes I try not to pay too much attention to it. To try and not to get myself too wrapped up or put too much pressure. 

That's probably smart. 

I mean, I put enough pressure on myself. I want to be great. I want to be considered a great musician. But you know, I want to work on myself and understand my strengths and my weaknesses without necessarily hearing -- 

All that noise that's out there about you. 

Yes. 

But what was it about the blues? 

You know, I got hooked on blues by a friend of mine named Eve Monsay. I have known her since I was eight years old. And she had a black Fender Stratocaster and a twin amp and she lived down the street from me and I could hear her playing. It was her and two other girls in her band, a bass player and a drummer. And so I used to just be drawn to the music. I'd go over there and ended up getting a guitar cut too. She wanted to go to a blues jam for her 15th birthday and so, she signed us up and we ended up getting up there and we were just -- 

Never looked back. 

Never looked back. I mean, the older musicians on the scene were really welcoming and embraced us and were really willing to share their knowledge of the blues because you know, it's considered a music that's somewhat being forgotten in pop culture. And so they were really excited when these two teenagers came up and just had a bunch of questions. 

And so much of the rich history is right here in America. 

Right, exactly, exactly. You know, once I started to really dive in, I became familiar with being from Austin, Texas, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmie Vaughan, and then going back into the history of where those guys grew up listening to T-Bone Walker and Lightnin' Hopkins, you know -- 

Didn't you turn down a scholarship at the University of Texas in order to go on the road with Jimmie Vaughan. 

Yes, I was offered a scholarship to UT for music. And I would just -- I debated it. I had long talks with my parents and grandparents were telling me I was making the wrong move -- 

They all said go to college. 

Yes, of course and I just felt for me, I knew that I wanted to be a musician and be involved in it somehow but I kind of wanted to find my own way for better or for worse. I'm stubborn. I don't like people telling me what to do. I don't take instruction very well. I'm kind of a terrible student. I kind of feel like my gut feeling is I know where to go. I'm confident in that. 

But how did you know you wanted to be a musician? 

I saw Michael Jackson on stage. 

Yes. 

I was five years old in Denver and -- 

You were five. 

I was five years old, my parents took me to this show and it was a complete surprise and I just fell in love with the energy, and -- 

And the dance and the music. 

Yes, the dance and the music and we had music growing up in the house and I was always the kid right next to the speaker, you know, trying to figure it out. So I just knew pretty much from day one. I remember having -- they would make you sign up sheets when you were a kid of what you're interested in. What's your favorite color, you know, and what you want to be when you grow up, and I would always say something that was somewhat safe I guess. I kind of want to be a lawyer or, you know, because I didn't want to be looked at as odd and I just kind of -- 

But you knew it was something else. 

I knew from day one, I got to get up on a stage. (MUSIC) (SINGING) Don't stop... (MUSIC) Don't stop baby all night long... Don't stop 'til the break of dawn... You know I ain't coming home... Oh, baby, just... 

But it wasn't easy for you. I mean, you had to struggle like everybody else. 

Yes. I made a choice though, you know, like I didn't do the school thing. And you know, I moved out of my parent's house. Didn't have much and I was just like, I'm going to survive as a musician. So I played four, five, six, seven nights a week, four hours a night, playing for tips in smoky blues bars knowing that, you know, I wanted to be alongside people that I'm fortunate enough to be alongside of. 

And knowing that you were learning and getting better and all of that. 

Yes. Just, you know, I wanted that experience. And from all the stories and the legends of blues guys and all that, you got to have your 10,000 hours and you got to -- 

Oh yes. 

-- really put in the time and work and figure out what it means to be on stage and perform live and be a part of a unit, you know. Everybody can get up and play guitar solos all day long. But you are a part of something. You got to understand how that works and understand how -- you know, you got to build confidence. You got to understand what works and what doesn't, and become more comfortable, you know. If I hadn't put in those hours and some of these gigs and these opportunities would still come up, I don't know if I would be able to own it, you know, and feel comfortable. But I feel like I worked, you know, for this. So, I think it was really important. It was a struggle though, you know, I got my lights shut off. 

You mean when your apartment, would you come in and say you haven't paid your bills, no more water, no more lights. 

Be in the middle of recording something... 

My impression is that you are more of a live, you know, guy than a studio musician. 

Yes. 

Well the title of this is Gary Clark, Jr. Live. 

That is. 

North America 2016. 

That is live and in person. Some of my favorite records, James Brown Live at the Apollo. 

Oh yes, me too. 

Marvin Gaye live in London, Stevie Ray Vaughn -- 

You can feel the audience is what makes it great for me, you can feel the audience as much as the performer.. 

Right. And I feel like that's really a place for me on stage. I feel comfortable and -- 

But touring is where the money is today too. 

Touring is it. Touring is it, so we stay touring. 

Yes, but that's true. I mean, it really has come to that, hasn't it? 

Yes. It's an interesting record business and that's part of why I'm so dependent on playing live, why have I been so focused on that because you never know. I mean, people -- I feel like people always want to come and see and hear live music. 

Yes, I'm sure they do. How many gigs do you do a year? 

You know, that's a good question. I think maybe we are doing maybe not so much this year. I was getting to a point where I was, you know, couldn't remember what day it was or where I was. I need to go home for a second. 

Yes. It's terrible when you say hello Sacramento, and in fact, you're in San Francisco. 

You know what, there has been a couple of times where I just hadn't said anything because I wasn't sure. 

I think some of the best have done that too. I mean I've heard about some names we will not mention, you know. 

Good night y'all. (LAUGHTER) 

Good night y'all, it's been great to be here in your lovely city. 

Exactly. 

You know. Tell we what is in this album here. Start with "The Healing." Tell me about the song. 

The healing was a song that originally was on a record of -- I was just sitting in the studio and kind of a little bit stuck about what I wanted to write about. And then I just, it kind of clicked. It was like this -- everything that I was listening to that I've recorded previously, I said well, it really was a weight off of me to express myself musically and I was just thinking back to about when I was a kid and when I used to run around. And whatever I could have gotten into, I feel like this music kind of put me in the right direction. And also listen to artists like Curtis Mayfield and you know, even artists like TuPac, you know, just hearing stories and it's kind of like I grew up a religious person but I have realized that music has been more of a guide to me than anything else I guess in my life and -- 

Music has been your religion in part. 

Yes. And, you know, it can bring me up and make me really think and self-reflect and you know, it's a -- 

Are you happiest when are you on stage performing? 

I'm happiest, yes, on stage performing. I'm just happy if there is music playing, if there is music somewhere. 

It somehow touches all of -- 

Yes, I mean -- 

-- the cells in your body. 

If I'm not playing it, I love to go out in a town on the road and go check out live bands, and if I'm back home -- 

Just to see what's happening. 

I need that in my life. 

Yes. 

I need it. (SINGING) Well, my baby's gone... Won't be back no more... My baby's gone... Won't be back no more... She left me soon this morning... Like she did the night before... 

Where do you live? 

I live down in Texas, outside of Austin, Texas. 

Outside of Austin. 

Yes, sir. 

It's a great place. 

It is a great place. I moved around a little bit. I lived in New York for a couple of years. It started to get cold and scared me away. 

Like today. It got windy. 

Yes, exactly. I was out in California for a little bit but -- 

Austin. 

Yes, I love to be home. I love being able to see my family. 

Where do you think you're going? You know, where is the journey leading? What is the next step? Is it just to get better? Is it to explore new experiences? 

Yes, I mean -- 

Is it to, you know, be -- to open people's ears to a variety of music or all of the above? 

All of it. I think you expressed that better than I could have. 

Maybe I should be writing songs. 

Maybe, there you go, there you go. 

It certainly would be better for me to write them than to sing them, I can tell you that. 

Well, how about if we collaborate? 

There you go. I will write and you sing. 

There we go. 

Now what's the hat about? 

The hat, I will tell you this. My dad bought me a hat a long time ago. I loved seeing Michael Jackson wearing a hat. I remember him singing "Who's Loving You" as a kid in Jackson Five and he had that purple hat. I thought it was just the coolest thing ever with his afro underneath. But from that to Stevie Ray Vaughn to Hendrix to Albert King, John Lee Hooker, it's kind of like just a thing. 

Kind of like it belonged. 

And I never put it on. I had one, my dad bought me one and I just thought it wasn't right. And I put it on one day and it took me awhile. I didn't feel comfortable. And then I just stepped out and got a couple of compliments like, wow, man, that's a good look on you, and I said, you know what, I think it is. 

You liked it, yes. And then it didn't feel comfortable not to have it. 

Right. I sleep in mine. (LAUGHTER) 

No, you don't. Let me remind everybody, Gary Clark, Jr. Live North America 2016. (SINGING) Start off with the bottle... Ended up with the bottle... Taking shots, waiting on tomorrow... Trying to fill up what's hollow... You're going to know my name... Well, you're going to know my name... Bright lights, big city going to my head... Bright lights, big city going to my head... Bright lights, big city going to my head... I don't care, no.. Because you don't care, baby... (MUSIC) Get lost in this city trying to find myself... I went up a different person... Came down somebody else... I know it ain't right, but it's all in my head... Oh, I'm surprised that I'm still alive... I shoulda been dead... These bright lights, big city going to my head... Bright lights, big city going to my head... Bright lights, big city going to my head... I don't care, no... Because you don't care, no... (MUSIC) You going to know my name... Well, you going to know my name... You going to know my name... You going to know my name by the end of the night...
