Ian Bremmer is here. He is, as you know, the president of the Eurasia Group. He recently traveled to the Middle East. He joins me now for a conversation about that region and other foreign policy developments of the day. I'm pleased to have him back at this table. Welcome. 

Charlie. 

This particular day, where the president's reacting to Syria, before he goes to Palm Beach to talk to the other most powerful person in the world, a big day for foreign policy. 

By far the most important day for global issues since Trump's been elected president. 

Start with China briefly and then move to Syria because you just got back from the Middle East. 

Yes. Well, China, what can you say, this is the single most important meeting that Trump has had since he's been elected. The orientation that Trump has had towards China, both on the campaign and since he's been elected, has been pretty strong and hawkish rhetoric. Some of those things he has walked back. Taiwan, he has walked back somewhat, though there's still a lot of talk about selling a lot more arms to the Taiwanese. Currency, he's walked back. But other issues like North Korea, South China Sea, and most importantly, trade, he's not walked back one bit. And the people around him are not hawks or doves. They're either pretty hawkish or quite hawkish. So the notion that Trump's going to have a good meeting with Xi Jinping, I think he wants it to be a respectful meeting. I think he doesn't want to have any gaffes. But clearly he wants to project a lot more strength in terms of the United States, and feels like the Obama administration has been a lot weaker. 

But I would add to that, he's got something he wants. He wants badly Chinese cooperation on North Korea. It is a pressing, immediate problem. 

True. And he's also said that if he doesn't get it that the Americans are prepared to go it alone. The question is -- there's been cooperation between the United States and China. In fact, after the election, the Chinese decided to support a U.S.-led U.N. referendum to take away Chinese purchasing of a great deal of North Korean coal, it ended up being well over half a billion dollars a year. That was a message sent to the United States and sent to the incoming Trump administration that, look, we are prepared to play ball with you, but we have to do it multilaterally within a framework. Now, as you know, Trump doesn't have a lot of interest in doing things with China multilaterally within the U.N. framework. He thinks that Chinese needs to cut these guys off. And I think the idea that the Chinese are going to do that themselves, they're going to say we're going to cut off the banks that are giving these guys money, cut off the companies that are keeping this economy afloat, and the risk is going to be on us, not on the United States because the North Koreans are in our region, our backyard. I think it's very hard to come to agreement with Xi Jinping that we're going to move together on this. And so it's more likely the Americans will talk about sanctions against those Chinese companies. 

What's the timeline you think on this, when will they have the capacity both in terms of deliverability and size of the nuclear weapon? 

Those are the two things because you need miniaturization to put it on the ICBM. Well, I mean, look, they apparently have missiles that can strike Hawaii and Alaska now. And, I mean, why we only care about the lower 48, not those two little states, I don't know. But apparently that's the line -- sorry, guys. But when it comes to -- most people that are involved in this that I talk to, and this is not you or my specialization, is that over the course of the Trump administration, if the North Koreans continue at the present level of development, that they would be able to do that. So in other words this is something that, barring impeachment, which I don't think anyone expects, Trump is going to have to deal with this issue, one way or the other, this is kind of his red line and -- 

What are his options? 

His options are on the stick side, number one, hit the Chinese, make it much more uncomfortable for them not to go along and then get the Chinese to -- compel the Chinese in some way, or cajole and compel the Chinese to take a harder line on the North Korean economy. A second would be some form of military buildup with American naval forces that would actually sort of higher levels of inspections, boarding that kind of thing of North Korean ships trying to export material and trade out of the peninsula. And then, of course, you'd also have direct military options to actually damage, degrade, even destroy North Korean delivery and nuclear capabilities. Now, combined with that are carrots which there is no reason why Trump can't also and shouldn't also say, look, North Korea, we are also prepared to sit down with you, even head of state to head of state, have that cheeseburger -- Trump had said that when he was on his campaign, said he'd give a cheeseburger, split a cheeseburger with the guy, right? He's not willing to do that now, but that was his position. There is no reason the Americans couldn't talk about providing significant economic support. 

A martial plan kind of thing. 

I wouldn't go that far, but certainly you can imagine an environment where if you had the kind of inspections that you presently have in Iran, that Trump could say this was a great deal, right, the art of the North Korea deal. There is no reason why we only have to be talking about sticks when we talk about North Korea. 

Why have we resisted bilateral negotiations? 

Well, we had bilateral negotiations. They just, ultimately, the North Koreans didn't go forward with -- I mean, every time we told them we're only going to talk to you, or -- 

As part of? 

As part of a broader negotiation to try to move towards inspections, instead they continue to test nuclear weapons and they continue to test ballistic missiles. But one thing I want to say which is really not being reported in the media is so far this year they've actually tested fewer weapons than they tested in the same time period last year. And yet, everyone is making it sound like the North Koreans are on this escalatory binge right now, that has more to do with the way the media portrays Trump and their belief that there is more likelihood that we could have confrontation because Trump is unpredictable than because the North Koreans themselves are suddenly out of the box. 

Speaking of Trump, after what happened with the gas, the chemical weapons used in Syria. 

Yes. 

Trump clearly came out and said he changed his mind. And two, there're reports that he may be prepared to use a military strike. 

Yes. That's right. 

What does that say? 

Well, I feel pretty confident that nobody that voted for Trump voted for him with the idea that they were voting for military strikes against Syria. He was the one that was saying -- 

How much he opposed the Iraq war. 

Well, and after he supported it, but specifically to Obama when Obama had already talked about the red line and many had already died from chemical strikes, he told Obama strongly in multiple Tweets, do not attack Syria, like this is not our fight, America first, like we want to cut back foreign aid under Trump. We want to take fewer refugees under Trump. And we're not going to talk about human rights in all these countries, whether it's, you know, Putin killing journalists or whether it's the Chinese engaging in horrible practices internally or externally. No, so suddenly, suddenly he cares about the Syrian kids because he saw that chemical weapons were being used yet again. I mean, it's hard to believe that. But at the same time, it's clear. 

So why is he doing this? In other words, you are saying it is hard to believe that he simply saw these atrocious pictures of children dying or having died from chemical weapons, that that wouldn't change his mind. 

Again, we have had those pictures before. So I mean it's not like these pictures -- 

We didn't have pictures while he was president. 

That's true, that's true. But again, he told Obama one thing, he clearly has shown he has the ability to change his mind and flip on a dime on a bunch of things. I do think that given the statements he has now made in the past 24 hours, the likelihood of some form of at least limited military strike against Syria is quite high -- 

For example, strike where the chemical weapons are located. 

For example -- 

But is there danger that somehow they do that, they will -- 

There's always danger of all sorts of civilian casualties when you are talking about these sorts of strikes. And there is also dangers unless you're just using drones that Americans are going to die in the fight as well. Though I think the biggest danger is the Russian reaction. Because of course when Obama was considering these strikes, when he was going to Congress, the Russians were not militarily engaged in Syria. That is not the case today. 

Here's my question. 

Yes. 

Why should we care? 

About? 

The Russians. 

Well -- 

What are they going to do? 

Maybe they're going to back down. And maybe they're not. 

So if they don't back down, what is it they're going to do, is my question? Are they going to do any more than what we did when they came into Syria? 

Look, I mean, the fact is that the Israelis have engaged in surgical strikes against Syria and the Russians didn't respond against them. 

My point. 

I think it's a fair point. I think it's a fair point. But I also know that Trump coming into office, one of the key things he wanted to accomplish was some form of rapprochement with a Russia that had a really bad relationship with the United States under Obama. And clearly, that's gotten vastly harder given all of the smoke around some of Trump's team and their relations with the Russians. 

Charges of collusion and all that. 

But this will be the end, let's put it this way, if Trump is concerned, let's not talk about American national interests, let's talk about Trump because we have seen what he has been doing. If Trump believes that the Russians actually have real intel out there, either on him or on any members of his team that matter, and he decides that he's going to engage in strikes against Syria after Russians have explicitly said that the Syrians, the Syrian government was not using chemical weapons, I would think that Trump would have some vulnerability there. 

Okay. The big "if" is do they have that kind of -- 

And I have no idea, I have no idea. 

-- so-called dossier information. 

But so far, you have to think that it's been strange that, you know, sort of despite the fact that you have people like Ambassador Haley that are taking on Putin and the Kremlin every bit as harsh in her words as we saw from Samantha Power when she was ambassador, but Trump has done zero of that. 

And she says that she has, you know, complete approval of the president to do that. 

Yes, she has said that. Look, she's still in her job, so I believe that's probably the case, but the fact is, Trump himself has made absolutely none of those statements, has taken every opportunity to say no, no, no. 

Haley points out that other people in the administration, not just her, have also been tougher on Russia than, verbally, than the president. 

Or than verbally Steve Bannon or than others. Yes, there is clearly an enormous split within the Trump administration on how to handle Russia. 

Mattis has been tougher. 

Absolutely, and Tillerson has been less so. Now, I mean, clearly the U.S.-Russia relationship in the last 24 hours has deteriorated more quickly, I would argue, than at any point under the Obama administration. There were high -- yes, absolutely. I mean, when you have -- 

The last 24 hours? 

Sure, purely on the basis of the Syria issue. I mean -- 

It's not anything that Russia has done. 

No. 

Or the United States has done. 

No. 

Just what the president has said he might do. 

And what he, the way he has approached the Syria issue which is virtually a 180 degree shift. Two days ago, you had the Trump administration saying look, Assad, there is no way to get rid of Assad right now. And so it's not a priority issue. 

You have people clapping, giving him a huge amount of applause because of this. 

Yes, John McCain. 

And -- 

Lindsey Graham, these are not fans of Trump. 

No. 

And John McCain said I don't care what the Russians do in reaction. Look, I mean my view has been from day one that Syria is more of a conundrum, more of a quagmire than even Iraq. But there are lots of ways to support the Syrian people if you want to support the Syrian people, right? I mean, there is, you can actually bring over more as refugees. You can actually provide more humanitarian aid. You can establish a safe zone. It is not at all clear to me that going after the Assad regime directly militarily is the way to go. I do think that something Tillerson said today is worth considering which is talking about that we are already taking steps to move towards a transition. I thought it was very interesting. 

Already taking steps to move towards a transition government in Syria which sees Assad exit. 

Out, and I think that there was a Kremlin spokesman who made a comment. 

Was that Peskov? 

I don't think it was Peskov. I think this is a lower level spokesman, it is always hard to read this, just a few hours ago, saying that Russia's support for Assad was not unconditional. Which I thought was interesting. And that to me -- 

But I've heard that before from Russia. 

I know, exactly. Well because, I mean, Assad, at the end of the day, Russia is not the only player, even perhaps the most important player in terms of Assad militarily, the Iranians are doing much more on the ground than the Russians are. So first of all, Putin doesn't call all the shots. 

That's because of Hezbollah, is that what you are talking about? 

Yes, and it's also because of Iranian higher level military support and advice, and some of those people have been killed in action, as you know. So the question is first of all, to what extent Putin is also thinking about using this as leverage against Assad. But is there an opening for Tillerson and for Trump to say, you know what, this isn't about military strikes against Assad. This guy is beyond the pale. We now need a transition that doesn't have Assad as part of the future of Syrian governance, but actually has something else. And is there a way to work with the Russians on that, especially if you are trying to coordinate with the Russians on anti-terrorism. It's going to be very difficult to get that done. But I would say you at least have a glimmer of light from the Kremlin statement until today. 

So this question, why did the Assad government do this? 

Well, I will give you a question in return. How confident are we that the Syrian president is the one that actually orders all strikes from his air force? Do we really think he has that level of control today given the deterioration of governance in the country? I don't -- I have -- 

So this was a rogue general or something? 

I don't know. I'm just saying I have a fair amount of confidence, given what the Pentagon has said, that chemical weapons were actually used by the regime against the people. That it was not, as the Russians claimed, that they hit a local depot and then it blew up, right? But I don't have, thus far, I have no reason to believe anything about who actually ordered it. I just don't. And you know, that raises the question of what kind of governance is there, we're in our seventh year of war. You got a guy that has -- 

Just ended the sixth year, beginning seven. 

Yes. And, you know, you've had millions of refugees and over 500,000 dead. And the idea that Assad has, you know, sort of complete strong Putin-like top-down control over his military forces, given all of that and given the clear lack of morale there, strikes me as an open question. I mean, you could argue that the fact that Trump said this isn't a priority, Assad can stay, emboldened him and say okay, now we can really go and use our toughest weapons just to destroy the morale of these people on the ground. But you could also just as easily argue that this was someone within the Syrian air force that decided to take this step. And that Assad was, you know, had nothing to do with it. I don't have a basis to make that decision. 

You were in the Middle East, where did you go? 

I was in the Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. 

How do they feel about Trump? 

They cautiously like Trump. All of these countries, first of all, they love the fact that Trump is seen to be a much more stalwart enemy of Iran, skeptical of the Iran deal. Secondly, to the extent that Trump is willing to go hard against terrorism, and even against radical Islamic terror. If you are one of the Gulf monarchs, you don't have that much of a problem with that. You also think that the lack of focus on human rights, I mean, Obama talked a great game, didn't do very much in the region, but he did, for example, limit some of the weapon sales to Bahrain towards the ends. The Trump administration is saying no, no, let's go back and give you guys whatever you need. Those things make them comfortable. But clearly, they are also unsettled by how much they don't know. In the Emirates, they were very concerned about the sudden laptop ban which they thought was more about helping American air carriers that are getting crushed by people like sort of Emirates Airline and Etihad, than they thought it was really about security. So I do think they're concerned about what happens if, you know, their kids go into American universities suddenly get, you know, extreme vetting when they come into the country. There are things that unsettle them longer term. But I will tell you, as of this week, you know, generally speaking in the Middle East, they are -- the Gulf states are more, and I'm talking Saudis too, I'm talking Qatar too, they feel more comfortable about Trump than they did about Obama. 

Because they believe he's more anti-Iran and because they believe that he is more likely to come to their defense if necessary? 

They think he's more focused on the traditional American allies in the region. They saw the way that Obama threw Mubarak under the bus, in Egypt the way that, you know, the way that Obama said he was going to work with Morsi. They hated that. 

Yes. 

They hated that. They think that Trump is easier. 

And what happened to Sisi when he came to the White House? 

Was treated incredibly well, yes. I mean, that was a much better greeting than you saw from Chancellor Merkel, you know. 

Yes. It's good to you have here, thank you. 

Charlie, always good to see you. 

Ian Bremmer. Back in a moment. Stay with us.
