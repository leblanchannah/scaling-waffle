And when we come back we'll talk about the man and the myth and what he was really like. Stay with us. 

So was he a brave explorer who brought the treasures of the New World to Europe or did he usher in an era of exploitation for the true discoverers of America? This week, 13 begins a look at Christopher Columbus and tonight we talk with Mauricio Obregon, host of "Columbus and the Age of Discovery," and a man who's done some adventurous exploring himself. Welcome. Pleasure to have you here. 

Thank you. 

There is this controversy about this man, there's myth, there's revision. Tell me the Columbus that you know and that you believe is the real Christopher Columbus, this man born in Genoa, Italy. 

I think it's pretty clear he was born in Genoa. 

Yeah, we know that. 

Even that is argued about. 

Oh, some Spaniards take credit? 

Oh, yes, and some people want him to be Irish and all kinds of things. 

And so tell me about him though, what kind of man was he? 

Well, first of all, he was the type of man that has only one vocation. His focus was on one thing. And you and I know lots of those, or a few of those. 

Yes. 

And they're unbearable but they're also irresistible. So this man, you know, was hard to stand sometimes, but he pounded his way through to the queen and wherever he could go. 

And the relationship with Isabella, what was it? 

Now I think Isabella, first of all, found him an imposing. This was an imposing figure. 

Yeah. 

He was tall for his age, I mean, the age in which he lived. And he was very serious and very pious and very polite. I think more than that, what Isabella had in mind was something quite different. Isabella realized -- she was a great statesman -- stateswoman -- 

Statesperson, whatever, yeah. 

And I think she realized, "Here I have a country that's been, for centuries, moving the frontiers against the Moors across the Spanish Peninsula. Now I've won. Granada has just given up. It's finished. What do I do with these people?" What do you do with a nation that's been warring for centuries? Do you suddenly tell them to go home and stir the soup? 

No. 

She had a problem. So this man brought something very valuable. What he brought was push the frontiers across the ocean. 

He brought imperialism. 

And I think this woman appreciated that. 

Yeah. 

If you want to call it that, yes. 

Well, he also -- he, from what my own reading, and you help me out, he was driven - he saw this as his way to be great. It was his chance at greatness. 

Absolutely, yes. It was his vocation. 

A brave man? 

I think so. 

Ruthless? 

Quite ruthless. 

Mean? 

Not necessarily mean, no. From what I read, I find him quite kind with people, with sailors and people like that. 

How much -- any myth? What's the myth that this series corrects? 

I don't think the series goes out to correct any myth. I think the point of the series, if I understand it -- I'm only one part of it -- is to try and show various points of view on him, which of course, as you have pointed out, is very controversial. 

The controversy is -- define it for us -- is that there are many people who say we're celebrating, you know, the 500th anniversary of -- 1492 to 1992 -- of this extraordinary development, and define the controversy that people look at this and say, well, we're giving too much homage to something that ought not receive such homage, or at least ought to be more balanced in its portrayal? As you know that conflict, define it for us. 

I think the point that I would like to make is that the discovery was, of course, a great event. 

Right. 

It was comparable, if you wish, to the Renaissance. It was part of the Renaissance. It may have caused the Renaissance to a certain extent, or it may have been one of its greatest effects. Now, when you have such a great historical event, nobody can appropriate it. People try to run around and appropriate this event. It's as if the Italians said the Renaissance was just Italian, the French had nothing to do with it. Oh, come now. The Renaissance happened all over the place. Same thing with the discovery. We Latin Americans, we like to think it's our 500th birthday. The Spaniards like to think it's a great Spanish feat. The Italians like to think it was the science of the Genoese who did it. The Indians may point out that it was the beginning of the end for them, and so on and so forth. 

And so Native Americans like to think, well, you know, what it led to was genocide and exploitation and the destruction of -- or at least the violence was done to a culture. 

Right. And I think they have every right to look at it that way. 

Therefore they -- 

I think the different points of view are all valid. This is a very complex event. And I don't think you can deny anybody the right of having his point of view on that subject. 

When Columbus landed the first trip, how long did he stay? 

He didn't stay very long. He finished that whole trip in a year, I mean, within a year, much less than a year. And what's interesting is that in that trip -- and this is an argument that might be used, some people might object to it -- but on that first voyage, which is the one we're going to commemorate, that was 1492, and it's 1992, everything was peaceful. He was an ally of the Indians. If it hadn't been for the guides from the island of San Salvador, he never would have found his way through the Bahamas and to Cuba and to Hispaniola and so on and home, because he needed a good place for takeoff. 

Right. 

So, one thing I like to point out is the Indians are always depicted as being only victims. At this stage of the game they were active participants, indispensable participants. Without them there would have been no discovery. Columbus most likely would never have gotten back without those guides. 

How many people did he leave here when he went back? 

40. 

40, and they were all killed? 

They were all killed. The impression is that they just abused the Indians. Now, there again, maybe I'm too tolerant, but I think there are many points of view. Here are 40 Spaniards left alone on Mars, right, they don't even know where they are, for a year, and naturally they go off the deep end and they begin to take -- naturally, I'm not justifying them -- they begin to take gold, Indian women and so on. And so the Indians, just as naturally, decide to do away with them. 

Yes. 

I see both points of view. 

Yeah. And when Columbus came back he couldn't find them. 

Yeah, this was very tragic. He went straight to the right place. He'd even explained how to locate the place by a mountain which is shaped like a tent and whatnot, he called it Monte Cristi. And he went right to the place, arrived in the evening, and he put up flares and he fired off canon shots, and no answer at all. 

No one came. 

And then the canoes began to come. And the first ones tried to say, "Well, everything is okay," and so on. But he knew very well it wasn't. And pretty soon the truth came out. There was also an interesting incident there. Another Indian - I use the word "Indians," you know, it's all the same. Of course they weren't Indians, but there you are. 

Native Americans are -- 

Yeah, you could say Native Americans or aborigines. You can call them whatever you wish. Indians is the simplest. Again, Columbus had an ally who stuck with him the rest of the voyages, and that was Guacanagari. Guacanagari was the guy who helped him rescue things off the Santa Maria when she was run aground and so on. Now, Guacanagari, when Columbus came back and found that all the Spaniards were dead and the fort had been burnt down, was lying in a hammock moaning, and Chanca, who was the surgeon, the doctor on the second trip, which was an enormous trip, almost 20 ships and 1,000 colonists and so on, Chanca examined Guacanagari who had bandages all over him. And said to Columbus, "This guy is lying. He is not even wounded." And Columbus said, "Put the bandages back. I need allies." This fellow was not so dumb. 

What was the most exciting discovery for you in your involvement in this project? What made it -- you know, if you were going to tell your children or grandchildren about this, the making of "Columbus: The Age of Discovery" -- 

Oh, you mean the series itself? 

Yes. 

Because of course I've been at this for a long time, I've done half a dozen books. 

I know you have. 

With Morison and whatnot. 

So there was nothing new for you in a sense in this? 

No. But then of course it was new to do things on television. It's a strange medium. 

Was it hard to make this? 

Yes, it's hard. I was given the right to read the script and correct it or rewrite some of the things I was going to say, but enlighten, and that I appreciated very much. Nevertheless, you have to work within very close limits. The statements have to be relatively short and so on. You can't go off as you do in a book and explain the whole show, you know. It's quite difficult. But it's interesting. 

What do you think of Kirkpatrick Sale's book? 

Terrible. 

Terrible? 

Absolutely terrible. 

Why? 

It's totally unfair. Many of the criticisms that he makes of Columbus are fair. I can make a number of criticisms of Columbus. 

So what's wrong with the book? 

But he simply takes things out of context and blows them up to a point where everything about Columbus is bad, and that's too much. 

How do the Spanish view him? I mean, is this controversy raging in Spain as well as it is here? 

Very much so, yes. Where it's most raging is in Spain and here in the U.S. Also, in Latin America, but mostly -- 

For understandable reasons in Latin America. 

Hmm? 

For understandable reasons in Latin America. 

Yes, but even so, it's strange, it's not so controversial. It still is, but not as much as it is here and in Spain. I met with a group of young people. I like to sail and these people take part in regattas and things on the Mediterranean, and I asked them about the 500th anniversary. They said, "We don't give a hoot. We're just not interested." 

Yeah. Someone said an interesting thing. They said the controversy about Christopher Columbus has much more to do with 1991 than 1492, in terms of the way -- I mean, this whole eurocentrism argument and all of that has looked at this business, because of what happened as a consequence, because others have said also that Columbus coming to America, you know, it not only influenced America, because of what happened here, but it also was the beginning of America's influence on Europe. And so therefore, you know, it assumes even more dramatic significance. But that the conflict is much more about a conflict that is of 1991 than 1492. 

I think that's true. I think what's happening, not only in '91 but perhaps the last few years, is that people have become more conscious of their roots and their heritage, and those roots and heritages which were not appreciated are now being defended and so on, and so that sends a lot of people overboard one way or the other. 

Columbus adopted Spain as a homeland. 

Yes. 

So he became a Spaniard? 

Not legally. It's interesting, the king and queen made a document recognizing that Columbus' brother had every right as a Spaniard. They never bothered to do it with Columbus. 

How did he die? 

Columbus died of an illness which is not well identified, but most doctors seem to think he had very bad arthritis, one thing or another. He died alone in Valladolid very much -- 

At what age? 

He was 40-something -- no, wait a minute, he was 50. 

Pleasure to have you on the broadcast. 

Thanks. 

Thank you very much, Mauricio Obregon. Christopher Columbus. We'll see you tomorrow night.
