Michael Morell is here. He's one of our nation's leading national security professionals. He most recently served as the CIA's deputy director, and twice as its acting director. I'm pleased to have him back at this table. Welcome, sir. 

It's great to be here, Charlie. 

Great to you see you. 

Great to have you back. 

It's good to be back. Let me just start with this. This is this morning's "Washington Post": House Intelligence Chair Alleges Spy Agency Abuse. "The Wall Street Journal": "GOP lawmaker sparks new battle over Trump's spy claim." New York Times": "GOP leader puts new spin on wiretaps. Take me through this, unpack this because I don't think most of us understand what the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is saying. 

Sure. And Charlie, this is complicated. But let me start with the punchline. Let me start with the bottom line. This, in no way, this in no way, validates the president's claim that he was, or his associates at Trump Tower, were the target of surveillance by the Obama administration. It doesn't even come close to validating. 

Even suggesting it was ordered by the president? 

Not even close. So what did the chairman say to the media and apparently to the president? He said that he had a dozen intelligence reports that somebody gave to him. He didn't get them officially from one of the agencies. Somebody gave them to him and said, I think there's a problem here, take a look at these. A dozen intelligence reports that he said involved incidental collection of U.S. persons, incidental collection about Trump transition team members. That's what he said he saw. He also said that he was troubled that some of the names that he saw were unmasked. And we'll talk about what all of that means. 

Okay. 

Let's start with what incidental collection is. There are two types of incidental collection. In one type of incidental collection where you are collecting on two foreign intelligence targets talking to each other, so make it a foreign minister of China, foreign minister of Russia talking to each other, and in their conversation they have, they talk about a U.S. person. That is incidental collection on that U.S. person, okay? That's one type. There is another type of incidental collection, which is where you have a legitimate foreign intelligence target in a conversation that you collect, but in that conversation, they are talking to a U.S. person. So a foreign intelligence target on one end of the phone and a U.S. person on the other end of the phone. That is also considered incidental collection. Incidental collection happens all the time. Obviously foreign officials in their conversations are talking about Americans. 

Is that what we think happened with Michael Flynn? 

I think Michael Flynn was the second type. 

That's what I mean. 

Right. The second type, right. But incidental collection, incidental collection happens all the time. So the first question, and there is really three agencies where this happens. It happens at NSA, most frequently. It happens with the FBI in their signals intelligence collection. And sometimes it happens with the Central Intelligence Agency. Those are the three agencies where it happens. When it happens, it's very easy, it's usually very easy to see that it is a U.S. person. It is either the name, the phone number, the context of the discussion, they actually mention the person's name. So it is pretty easy to see they are either talking about a U.S. person or talking to a U.S. person. So the first judgment that the collecting agency has to make is, is there information here of intelligence value that we need to disseminate? And if the answer to that question is no, then all of that is discarded. But if the answer to that question is yes, there is intelligence value in this conversation, either about a person or with a person, then they disseminate that. Now I know NSA best when it comes to these procedures. And that decision about whether to disseminate incidental -- information that includes incidental collection is a very rigorous process at NSA. It's not just one person making the decision. It's one person recommending that it be disseminated and then check off, check off, check off, check off at higher levels. So that decision to disseminate that is a significant one. With regard to the kind of incidental collection where the U.S. person is actually talking to the foreign intelligence target, you can only, even if you decide to disseminate, you can only disseminate what the foreign intelligence target was saying. You can't disseminate what the American citizen, what the U.S. person was saying. So you can only say the Russian ambassador in a conversation with the U.S. person said the following. You can't say and in response the U.S. person said X, Y and Z. You can't do that. There are two cases and only two cases where you can actually disseminate what a U.S. person said. And it's rare. It is when they admit that they have conducted a crime, so yesterday I robbed a bank, yesterday I shot somebody, or they say they're going to commit a crime. So they pose an imminent threat. I'm going to conduct a terrorist attack tomorrow. In that case, this incidental collection, specifically about the U.S. person, can be turned over to the FBI to take action, to prevent, right, or to either solve a crime or prevent one. But that's it. That is really rare. So when a U.S. person -- very important for viewers to understand -- when a U.S. person is caught up in intelligence collection in a conversation with a legitimate intelligence target, almost never, almost never does something that person said get disseminated. The next big issue here is called masking. And Chairman Nunes focused a lot on this yesterday. What is masking? Masking is when you have incidental collection, for most people, for most U.S. persons, you can't use their name. So you don't say, you don't say the Russian ambassador in conversation with Michael Morell, or the Russian ambassador and some other Russian official talking about Michael Morell. You can't use the name, you have to say U.S. person, right. And if there is more than one U.S. person, it is U.S. person one and U.S. person two. That is the way it gets disseminated. There is an exception to that. And I think what the chairman had might be the exception. The exception, the exception is the most senior U.S. officials. And I think also senior officials in the transition, including the president-elect. The most senior officials don't get masked. So when two foreign officials are talking about the U.S. president, that doesn't get masked into U.S. person one or U.S. person two. They just disseminate it with the president of the United States; or, I would bet, the president-elect of the United States. I bet you that is some of what Chairman Nunes saw. 

Do you think that might have been what President Trump might have seen that caused him to form the belief that he did, that he articulates? 

It's possible, right, because he was receiving intelligence reports when he was the president-elect. He was getting a briefing as often as he wanted one, right? We know he wasn't getting it every day, but getting it as often as he wanted one, so maybe he saw some of those. Maybe he saw some about General Mattis or Rex Tillerson or Michael Flynn, right? So maybe he saw those, maybe that led him to think somebody is surveilling us. No, it is incidental collection. Now when you have one of these intelligence reports in front of you and you've got these masks == U.S. person one, U.S. person two, U.S. person three -- the most senior officials in our government, people at my level and above, when I was in government, so the deputy level and above, can ask NSA, the FBI, CIA, depending on who produced the information, they can ask for that information to be unmasked. So I could say to NSA, I need to know who that U.S. person is. Where it says U.S. person one, I need to know that and I need to know it for the following reasons. 

So to ask to unmask somebody, if you are the deputy director of the CIA -- 

Or higher. 

You got to have a good reason. 

You got to have a good reason. 

Right. 

And again, in the case of NSA. 

Who decides as to whether that's a good reason? 

In the case of NSA, which again, I know the best because they do this more than anybody, there is only 20 people at the National Security Agency who can approve an unmasking request. And it is taken very seriously. Michael Morell wants us to unmask this name, here is why he said he needs it, answer yes or no. And there has got to be a good reason. And when something does get unmasked, when you do tell Michael Morell who U.S. person one is, you don't tell anybody else. There is not this broad distribution of the unmasking that Chairman Nunes implied yesterday. It goes to only the person who made the request. Now, here is what is interesting. People in the transition who were receiving intelligence reports, and maybe they see the intelligence target talking to U.S. person one or talking about U.S. person one, right, and they're talking about how to approach the Trump administration, if you are the head of the Trump transition, you might want to know who U.S. person one is or U.S. person two, right? You can ask. You can ask through your briefer who comes to see you every day. And NSA will make a determination. So it is not -- I'm not saying this happened, but it's not impossible that some of the unmasking was actually at the request of the Trump transition. 

Why is this coming forward now? 

So I think there is a political answer to that, and there is a tactical answer. The political answer is the president is under fire for claiming that the Obama administration surveilled him. 

The FBI director said he had seen no evidence of that and every other national security official. 

Right. And so the president is hanging out there politically. And I think Chairman Nunes is trying to help him out. That is the political motivation. The tactical was somebody put these reports in front of the chairman and said, we think this is significant, right. There is all these reports out there with the names of -- 

And the person likely came from? 

So it's not 100 percent clear to me who disseminated these reports. It's possible it is NSA, possible it's CIA. The chairman said it was FISA reporting, which I think takes you to NSA or the FBI. 

Meaning somebody had used that in a request that there be a FISA? 

Yes. So what a FISA is, right. What a FISA is, just to be clear, is if the intelligence community wants to collect in the United States, either against a foreign government or a foreign person or a U.S. person who they think might be an agent of a foreign power, and they have some evidence that they are an agent of a foreign power, that requires a FISA warrant. That requires the intelligence community to go to the FISA court and make an argument for why they should be able to do that. Collection overseas against foreign nationals doesn't require a FISA warrant. 

And who would do that here, the FBI mostly? Or NSA? 

Both. 

Both. 

Both. 

But not the CIA? 

CIA on rare occasion. 

So, the other complaint of Adam Schiff, for example, and John McCain made this point as well, is that rather than bringing it to the House Intelligence Committee, he went right to the White House. 

So I think, yeah, he took it to the White House and the media. 

Right. 

Right. I think he had a responsibility, but I think he acted inappropriately. I think what he should have done and what practice says he should have done, is number one, he should have gone back to the relevant agency, whether it be the FBI or whether it be CIA or whether it be NSA, to go back to the relevant agency and said, I was given these. How do I think about these? Are there any more like these? Help me understand these. That should have been step one. Step two should have been to take that answer and share it with the entire committee before taking any action of briefing the president, let alone the media. 

You said in the beginning that this has nothing to do with whether President Obama's administration bugged Trump Tower. 

So what the president said was that he and his associates were actually the targets of surveillance, that the surveillance was targeted on them. That's what he said. And the president of the United States personally approved it which is ridiculous. Presidents don't approve things like that. That is what he said. This collection, based on the chairman's own words, was not targeted at any U.S. person, it was targeted at a foreign national and there was U.S. person information incidentally collected. That is why that incidentally collected is so important. 

But the impact of this in terms of how people have characterized it has raised questions about the independence of the House Intelligence Committee, and John McCain said, for example, that the committee -- Congress no longer has credibility, we need a select committee. 

So I think the chairman has done himself damage. The chairman is supposed to be running an objective nonpartisan investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, specifically whether or not they cooperated, conspired with, the Russian campaign to interfere in our election. That's what he is supposed to be doing. And when he does something like this that looks so political, he undermines the credibility of what he is doing, right. And that's why people like John McCain are reacting to this the way they are. I, too, from the very beginning, Charlie, have believed that we actually need a commission to look at this. And a commission to look at -- 

Like the 9/11 Commission or something else? 

I would think in a perfect world it would be the 9/11 Commission, right. It's not going to happen because it requires a presidential signature on a piece of legislation. So I think the best we can hope for would be a joint inquiry of Congress. Where it is a congressional inquiry but it's joint with a select committee. 

Is this like the Watergate Committee? 

Yes, yes. So what would that, what would that, what would that commission or committee look at? I think number one the first thing they would look at is what did the Russians actually do? The intelligence community has a view on that. But we may not fully understand everything they did. Or how they did it. 

So what do you think they did? 

So let me tell you what the intelligence community said they did. And then I'll tell you what I think. So what the intelligence community said, and they said this in a declassified document, during the last weeks of the Obama administration, the intelligence community said the Russians did three things. Number one, the one everybody knows about, which is they use cyber espionage to steal emails from the -- 

Democratic National Committee and John Podesta. 

From the DNC and John Podesta, and turned that, turned the most damaging material over to WikiLeaks and other organizations who would publish it, damaging from the perspective of Secretary Clinton. Everybody knows that. 

You believe this was, and they have suggested, it was the Russian government that did it, and in fact, they did it at the direction of Vladimir Putin? 

Yes, at the direction -- 

This is what the FBI is suggesting. 

-- at the direction of -- they said it very clearly -- at the direction of Vladimir Putin. Initially with the intent, initially with the intent of undermining our democracy. Having, raising questions about our democracy. Undermining Secretary Clinton who Vladimir Putin hates. But it evolved towards a preference for Donald Trump. So eventually to actually help Donald Trump. And it looked like when she was going to win, right, in early October, late September, early October, to undermine her presidency should she become president, right, to weaken her. 

Right. 

All of that was his intent. So that is the first thing they did. The second thing they did which most people haven't heard about, don't fully understand, which I think was actually more powerful at the end of the day, is the use of social media to both create fake news and to amplify fake news, news that was damaging to Secretary Clinton. So for example, when the secretary slipped on September 11th in New York, here in New York, there were several hundred thousand Tweets within a few minutes coming out of eastern Europe and coming out of Russia, raising questions about whether she was fit to be the president of the United States. 

And where do you think they came from? 

They came from Russian intelligence. And their use of proxies. A large number of proxies to push out social media. This use of social media as a weapon against our democracy went over a very, very large period of time, right up to the end of the election. And it impacted the polls. So you could see the impact on the polls. 

Let me talk about a couple of things in which we have had people out there and beyond the testimony we heard from Mike Rogers and from James Comey. The head of DNI then, Clapper -- 

Yes. 

-- said he had seen no evidence of a collusion. Now, there has been some clarification of that. 

Yes. 

Do you know what he meant? 

Yes. I think I know what he meant. But let me do one more thing. The third thing the Russians did was they tried unsuccessfully to get into the vote-counting machines. 

Right, unsuccessfully. 

Unsuccessfully. I believe that had they been successful, they would have tried to tamper with the vote. This wasn't just a test run. 

They were unsuccessful because it was more difficult than they thought? 

Absolutely, absolutely. Okay, now to answer your question. So in this big Russian campaign -- 

This is at the same time that he, in an interview on "Meet the Press," that he said, I have seen no evidence of the fact that the Obama administration tried to bug Trump Tower. 

Right. So there are -- in this big Russian campaign to try to influence the outcome of our election, right, there is a question. And the question is, did anybody in the Trump campaign know about this or assist it, conspire with the Russians in any way? That is the big question, right? 

That's why it is an ongoing investigation. 

And that's what Director Comey said is being investigated right now by the FBI. It's also being investigated by the two intelligence committees. It's also being investigated by a whole bunch of reporters. 

Right. 

So what I say, Charlie, is that there are lots of things that have to be investigated. Roger Stone's apparent knowledge or, not apparent -- Roger Stone's knowledge that information from John Podesta's emails was about ready to come out. He knew about that a week ahead of time. 

"He's gonna be in the barrel." 

He's gonna be in the barrel. So things that Roger Stone did, things that Paul Manafort did. 

Roger Stone defends that and says that's not what he meant at all. 

Pretty clear to me, pretty clear to me. 

I'm just telling you. 

Things that Paul Manafort, right, Paul Manafort, it now appears that he made a major proposal to the Russian government to assist them in their information campaign both domestically and overseas, right. And he said it didn't have anything to do with the Russians ever. So there's all sorts of things to investigate here, right? And that's what I call smoke. That's what I call smoke. 

But do you see any fire? 

I have not -- I personally have not seen any fire, right. And what Jim Clapper told me on "Meet the Press" was that Jim Clapper didn't see any fire up to January 20th when he walked out the door. That he didn't see any evidence -- 

Of collusion. 

-- of collusion on those questions that we just talked about. 

And saw no evidence of any -- 

Right. 

-- attempt to -- 

Right. And just because there is an investigation, some people in the last few days have said Jim Comey admitting that there is an investigation into this must mean that there is some evidence, right? Not the case. A counterintelligence investigation has a pretty low standard to get started. 

Okay. Since Donald Trump -- before and since he has been president, there has been this question of his relationship with the intelligence community, all of the intelligence community. He has raised questions about their competence, and he has raised questions about leaking, and he has raised questions about whether they are acting in the national interest. How is that relationship today because you know these people? 

So my understanding is that it's getting better, it is much better. So the things you are -- most of the things you are talking about happened during the transition. And most of the things you are talking about happened in response to the intelligence community's judgment that Putin was trying to help him and hurt Secretary Clinton and he didn't like that message, right? 

And he didn't, by he, Donald Trump didn't like any insinuation that because of that he might not have won the election. 

Right, exactly. That's what he didn't like. And so he pushed back against that and he pushed back against it by raising questions about the effectiveness, credibility of the intelligence community in general, and the CIA, in particular. That's what happened. He shouldn't have done that, but that's what he did. That caused a big morale problem. But since becoming president -- and by the way, during that transit
