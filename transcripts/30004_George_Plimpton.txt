Charlie Rose:Truman Capote made it fashionable to be known. He was both a gracious host and a coveted guest in the world of politics and fashion and Hollywood. Following the tremendous success of his true crime story, In Cold Blood, and his novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's, he became one of the most celebrated people in America. George Plimpton joins me now for a conversation about a new oral biography, Truman Capote, in which various friends and enemies and acquaintances and detractors recall a turbulent and very interesting career. And I am pleased to have George back at this table. Welcome back, sir. 

George Plimpton:A great pleasure. 

Charlie Rose:Happy New Year. 

George Plimpton:Happy New Year to you, Charlie. 

Charlie Rose:Tell me-- tell me about -- A -- the doing of this, because you and I were just saying that we both find oral biography fascinating. There's nothing I would rather do today than have access now to all of the oral biographies-- I mean, the oral memoirs at the Kennedy Library. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:I mean, just to go there now-- 

George Plimpton:Sure. Right. 

Charlie Rose:--and to have access to those that will be opening up over a period of time would be great. 

George Plimpton:Well, this is the-- this is the third one that I've worked on. The first one was Robert Kennedy, as a matter of fact, American Journey: The Life and Times of Robert Kennedy. Jean Stein was the-- did the interviews. I did the editing. Then together we did a book called Edie about Edie Sedgwick, the sort of girl who -- a different arc than Truman Capote, started with-- the daughter of a very rich, patrician family and sort of drifted down through these various worlds, ended up in motorcycle gangs in Buena Vista and so forth. I think to do the oral biography, you have to have somebody who has moved through a great many levels of stratas of society, as, indeed Edie Sedgwick did, and, certainly, Truman-- Truman born in Monroeville, Alabama, moved from there to be the sort of startling light of the literary world, a social lion, probably the most-- a social arbiter if you will, like a Mrs. Astor, in New York City, gave this famous ball, wrote, as you said, this extraordinary book, this crime drama, In Cold Blood, and then made a curious sort of an Aristotelian error, hubris. He thought he could get away with writing a certain piece, a certain couple of chapters of his latest-- of his last novel, a mistake, and then a slow descent into mediocrity and, really, quite an amazing arc. I think you have to have someone like that to do this sort of oral biography about because what you do is you get the raw material and there's nothing more fun than the raw material, particularly when you have friends and enemies like-- like Truman. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Who had opinions and observations and contacts-- 

George Plimpton:Oh, absolutely. It's sort of like-- the idea I had in doing this-- it's sort of like-- and the image that I had-- it's sort of like inviting-- being invited to a huge cocktail party in a vast sort of ballroom and they're somehow, luckily, arranged chronologically so that you move from one group to the next and you eavesdrop all the way. You begin with the friends in Monroeville, Alabama. Then you go from there to early New York-- Leo Lerman's soirees, and from there to Yado, the writing community, and from there to Kansas for the people that were there in the writing of In Cold Blood, all the way through. And through that you get first-hand biography, quite unlike ordinary biography, which is third-hand, where you get a brilliant biographer to guide you through this. But it all has to come through third-hand, whereas this is first-hand. It has a very appealing attraction to it, I think. 

Charlie Rose:The one person-- I asked this before we began. The one person that you wanted included that was not available-- Harper Lee, next-door neighbor growing up in Alabama. 

George Plimpton:In Alabama. Absolutely astonishing that a town of, what, 1,600, these two writers of considerable substance would come from that town, living next door to each other and knowing each other very well. There are some people, of course, that think that Truman helped a lot with To Kill a Mockingbird, but the styles are so different, it's quite obvious that he didn't. But it is an extraordinary coincidence. 

Charlie Rose:Harper Lee said? 

George Plimpton:She did not want to talk about-- to me about Truman-- or she never gives interviews to anybody, for that matter. She has these-- writes a very polite note and says, ``I'm very sorry. I don't want to talk.'' I asked her-- I even asked her if she would be-- could be interviewed for the Paris Review, which is the magazine I edit-- 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

George Plimpton:--which has had interviews with almost every distinguished-- 

Charlie Rose:--and everybody else. 

George Plimpton:Yeah-- Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner. Back came a little card saying, ``I'm terribly sorry. I don't give interviews.'' Good for her. 

Charlie Rose:But for everyone else, they were willing and anxious because he's been dead now for 14 years-- to talk-- 

George Plimpton:Right. 

Charlie Rose:--to remember. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. And how they do remember! 

Charlie Rose:Let's talk a little bit about who he was and what made him interesting to you beyond the things you've said. Some people divide his life into kind of three acts and they'll talk about this notion that-- and you can look at them in terms of the books. First was Other Voices and Other Rooms. Am I-- Other Voices, Other Rooms-- and he wrote that when, in fact, he was-- what? He was a copy person at The New Yorker, almost, right? 

George Plimpton:Just about. He'd written a short-- a couple of short stories for Mademoiselle, which in those days used to publish-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:--remarkable short stories that introduced the careers of a great many writers-- quite different now. And he was a copy boy at The New Yorker and never went to college. In fact, during his college years, that was when he was copy boy for The New Yorker. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:Got fired from The New Yorker, supposedly for rearranging the cartoons and various things and putting the ones he didn't like behind a desk, and also for insulting Robert Frost at a-- he told me this story once. He was listening to a reading of Robert Frost up at Breadloaf-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Right. 

George Plimpton:--and in the-- sitting in the first row. This was an elfin figure. And he got a cramp in a foot or something and he bent over and he couldn't get rid of the cramp, so he crept out of the-- of the room where the reading was going on and Frost knew that he represented The New Yorker-- in fact, he didn't. He'd just put The New Yorker on a list. And Frost was so outraged that The New Yorker thought this of his poetry reading that he hurled a book at him. Mind you, Truman did tell an awful lot of-- he was a great embellisher of stories, so you never can really be quite true whether these things are absolutely so. 

Charlie Rose:He would lie. 

George Plimpton:He was a famous but charming liar. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:He always felt that if it didn't happen that way, it should happen that way, so-- 

Charlie Rose:So that when Other Voices, Other Rooms appeared, were they surprised at how good a writer he was? 

George Plimpton:I think somewhere-- it was a very different sort of a novel. It was a sort of deep Gothic Southern novel, one of the first of its kind, really, and got a great deal of attention. Diana Trilling, other critics wrote a lot about it. It was scorned by some as being too heavily sort of Spanish moss. There's one figure in it who's a-- communicates by dropping a-- by throwing a tennis ball. He's a cripple. He communicates by throwing a tennis ball down a stairway. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:Not an ordinary tennis ball, but red tennis balls. I mean, there's-- everything is a little bit excessive. But he created a great stir and made Truman at the age of 22 or 23 a sort of enfant terrible in American letters, all of this supplanted, of course, by the-- all of this done by a person who was an extraordinary person to see and to listen to, only about five feet two in height, very small, with this lisping voice, very high. 

Charlie Rose:High-pitched voice. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. Gore Vidal used to say it could only be understood by dogs. Gore did not like Truman very much. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. What was it about them? 

George Plimpton:Well, I think they were hugely competitive and they were both at the same time-- Gore Vidal had written a novel called Williwaw and Truman had come along a little bit later. They were of the same generation. They ran into each other at social functions. They had just a-- they were competitive, extremely competitive, and slightly scornful of the other. 

Charlie Rose:Because you talked about the physical persona of Truman Capote, here is an excerpt that George brought  on the talk show circuit, with Truman Capote talking with David Frost and later with Dinah Shore. Take a look. 

David Frost:Welcome, please, Mr. Truman Capote! 

Narrator:People knew him not only as a successful writer, but as that funny little man who appeared on all the television talk shows. 

Truman Capote:What is the nearest thing in physical sensation to an orgasm? And I came up with the idea that it was sneezing. 

Dinah Shore:Did I read somewhere that you said all actors are stupid? 

Truman Capote:You're overstating it. 

Dinah Shore:Oh, good. I'm glad. 

Truman Capote:I said most actors are stupid. 

Dinah Shore:Most actors? 

Charlie Rose:The second period is In Cold Blood. What did he intend to do with that? He went out there on assignment for The New Yorker. 

George Plimpton:He was sent out there by Shawn of The New Yorker. The first thought was he was going to do a story about the reaction of a small town in western Kansas to having this multiple murder take place in it, of the Clutter family-- 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

George Plimpton:--farm house in the middle of nowhere, cut down with shotgun blasts. And they had not, at that particular point, discovered who the murderers were. So Truman went out there to do a story on the effect of these murders on a small town. How did people react to it? What were their reactions (unintelligible) could very well have been that the murderers came from the townspeople themselves? He took Harper Lee with him. Harper Lee went with him, really, to sort of ingratiate this rather curious person that you just saw on the television screen to the-- to the folk of western Kansas. He went out there wearing a long Bronzini scarf and his manner and so forth. And by the time it was all over, the townsfolk truly fell in love with him. He was a terribly popular figure there, wore a cowboy hat and Western boots and became really quite a different sort of a person out there. The murderers were discovered and that-- and the whole-- the whole Clutter murder case, plus the trial, plus the execution, is, of course, this astonishing-- 

Charlie Rose:He had to wait for that-- 

George Plimpton:--In Cold Blood. 

Charlie Rose:--though, to finish the book. I mean, he felt like the execution-- 

George Plimpton:He had to wait till-- 

Charlie Rose:--was essential to-- 

George Plimpton:Yeah. There's a sort of-- yes, poor, old Truman. He had really-- there were two sides of that. On one side of him, he very much liked one of the murderers, a fellow called Perry Smith, who was small, very like he, Truman, had wanted to be an artist, came from a dysfunctional family, very much-- very much like Truman, except there was a way of either going on this path or this. He picked the wrong one and there he was on death row. Truman had a hugely emotional relationship with him. 

Charlie Rose:Was it homoerotic or something? 

George Plimpton:Well, it was, very likely. In fact, one of the witnesses out there, Harold Nye of the FBI, says they actually had a physical relationship in the prison, which is almost impossible. Charles McAtee, another one of the witnesses-- one of the problems, of course, with oral biography is that you get conflicting views and different stories. But fortunately, you can put both of them there. And Charles Nye said-- Charles-- Charlie McAtee says that's absolutely irresponsible and absurd. They could not have had a physical-- simply by the way the death cells are placed, where there's always a guard there and so forth. But Truman did have this great affection for Perry Smith, so in one way, he probably wanted him to survive, but on the other, it would have destroyed the whole concept of In Cold Blood. So it supposed to have, when he heard their final appeal did not go through, he is supposed to have danced a little jig of delight. But a torn man, I think, because one side of him wanted to see them go because it meant that-- 

Charlie Rose:And then he-- 

George Plimpton:--esthetically, the book had to work that way. The other was this huge sympathy for this kid. 

Charlie Rose:He went to the execution. 

George Plimpton:He went to the execution. It affected him enormously and some people think that the execution had quite a lot to do with his-- with his slow decline after In Cold Blood and after the great ball that he gave after the-- after the publication of In Cold Blood. 

Charlie Rose:More about that in a moment. Here is Capote on tape, describing the story of In Cold Blood. 

Truman Capote:In Cold Blood is a story about the murder of a family in a small town in western Kansas, a Mr. Herbert W. Clutter and his wife, Bonnie Clutter, and their two teenage children. This was an especially strange and brutal murder in 1959, in which the family were shotgunned to death for no apparent cause or motive whatever. My book's a completely factual account and every word in it is true and based on innumerable interviews with the people directly concerned over a period of five years. 

Charlie Rose:The great ball, 1966, to honor Katharine Graham's birthday-- Truman had sort of-- I mean, was the envy of everybody in New York because he gave this great black-and-white party that you went to. 

George Plimpton:I was lucky enough to go it, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. And he made a big deal about who got an invitation. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. I lived quite-- I knew Truman. He lived quite close to where we did in Sagaponack, Long Island, so we were friends socially. Most of the people there were hugely celebrated, from all the worlds of literature and the theater and-- and there he was-- there it was. I mean, to think that Truman had become the social arbiter of New York-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:--with people so in despair at not being invited to this ball that-- 

Charlie Rose:And he'd taken such joy in being able to choose who would come and not come. 

George Plimpton:I think he took a lot of joy in that. As someone said, he delighted 500, 400 people, but made 15,000 enemies. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah! Exactly! 

George Plimpton:And there were some people that literally would pack up and go to Europe so that they could say that they were-- 

Charlie Rose:They weren't there. 

George Plimpton:--couldn't go to the ball because they happened to be in Paris. 

Charlie Rose:It was in honor of Kay Graham's birthday. 

George Plimpton:Very clever of him. Katherine Graham, her husband had just-- not long before had committed suicide. There she was, given the empire of The Washington Post and so forth-- shy, retiring. Her daughter told me, actually, that the ball had more to do with giving Katharine Graham a sense of confidence and a sense of who she was-- 

Charlie Rose:Than anything that came along-- 

George Plimpton:--than anything else, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:--after and she did a remarkable job running The Washington Post after-- 

George Plimpton:Of course. 

Charlie Rose:--the assassination. As a person, he was vain. He thought of himself, he said, as beautiful, handsome. Yes? 

George Plimpton:Well, from the-- from the waist up, he was unbelievably handsome. He had these odd, truck-driver's powerful legs, like a mustang or-- 

Charlie Rose:From the waist down. 

George Plimpton:--from the waist down, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:He was-- his-- I think he was-- he was one of the best story tellers I've ever heard. He had a way-- he used to prepare for having lunch with you, or supper with you. John Knowles, the writer-- 

Charlie Rose:He would prepare to have dinner? 

George Plimpton:Yes. He would say, ``I'm going to tell the following stories.'' He'd sort of really work up a program so than when he came-- and that's how he got along so terribly well with the very-- with these tycoons' wives and so forth because he would really-- 

Charlie Rose:Because he was so interesting. 

George Plimpton:He really worked at entertaining them and he was a marvelous story teller and something of a quipster, as well. He made the famous remark about Jack Kerouac being simply a typist. He once described-- 

Charlie Rose:What he said was, ``That's not writing, that's typing.'' 

George Plimpton:``That's typing,'' right. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:Yes. And he-- I remember he once described Bill Paley as a-- the head of CBS, as a man who looks as though he has just swallowed an entire human being. He would say things-- 

Charlie Rose:Now, what was your-- you had a great friendship with him, but also you came to conflict with him. 

George Plimpton:Well, I made-- I did a terrible-- I did something rather-- I wrote a story called ``The Snows of Studio 54.'' It was published in Harper's magazine. And it was a take-off on The Snows of Kilimanjaro, Hemingway's story about the fellow who's lying there on a cot, about to be flown back to Nairobi. He's got gangrene in a leg. And in my story, which was the Hemingway style, but Truman's sensibility, Truman was sitting in an airport at San Diego, having just come down from a fat farm, where he's had his face lifted and his behind lifted. And he's waiting there and he thinks back on his enemies and his friends and so forth. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:It was terribly clever, so I thought. I still think it's pretty clever. 

Charlie Rose:But Truman didn't. 

George Plimpton:Truman did not. I wrote him a letter of apology and he was absolutely outraged and said that I had come scratching to his door, begging for an apology. And I'm sorry about that because I shouldn't have done it. 

Charlie Rose:You shouldn't have done it? 

George Plimpton:But it was good. It was terrific stuff. 

Charlie Rose:It was good writing, but bad-- but bad-- 

George Plimpton:But it was-- I shouldn't have-- 

Charlie Rose:--politics. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. Well, I was told-- someone told me that he really liked it secretly and it used to be read to him in the morning when he was lying in bed, wanted to be entertained. So maybe he liked it better than he let on. 

Charlie Rose:Answered Prayers, which, in the end, sent him into a spiral. What was that about? 

George Plimpton:Well, Answered Prayers was supposed to be his great Proustian novel about these people that he spent so much of his time with, the very rich-- 

Charlie Rose:Social lions, the wives and-- 

George Plimpton:Yeah, the wives and so forth. 

Charlie Rose:--the rich. 

George Plimpton:And he made this mistake. He published a chapter of it in Esquire magazine called ``The Cote Basque,'' and it was a story about these people sitting around in the Cote Basque, this restaurant opposite the St. Regis Hotel. And it's told through the-- Lady Ina Kuberth, who was probably Slim Keith, who was one of his really best friends. And it's-- they gossip and they-- and it was sort of a roman a clef in short form. It was very easy to recognize who these various people were. And they were tales told out of school and they outraged Babe Paley and Slim Keith and Gloria Guinness, all these people that-- who had sort of taken him under his-- under their wing. 

Charlie Rose:And he would go on holiday with them on yachts and he would-- 

George Plimpton:Oh, yes. The Agnellis and all-- 

Charlie Rose:--go to their house and everything else. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:And all of a sudden, they let it be known he was persona non grata. 

George Plimpton:Yes. He was thrown into Coventry. That was the last time they ever-- they turned their back on him and he was-- it was terrible for him. I think he probably thought he'd get away with it, that they'd be amused, they'd say, ``Oh, naughty Truman,'' but-- and his idea was-- 

Charlie Rose:Or he said they were too stupid to know. 

George Plimpton:He also said that, I think somewhat-- well, cynically. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:It was a typical Truman remark. I'm not sure that he really believed that because adored them so much. 

Charlie Rose:Right. And desperately apologized to them in-- 

George Plimpton:Tried. 

Charlie Rose:--letters and phone calls and-- 

George Plimpton:Tried. Tried. 

Charlie Rose:--would listen in when John O'Shea would call up and stuff like that. Yeah. And he would-- oh, it must have been very sad-- very sad for him. And I don't know why he did it. There's no way that-- you can read that piece and think, ``What on earth has he done there?'' And that was one of the chapters of Answered Prayers and I think that the reaction probably stopped him from finishing it. Nobody really knows what happened to Answered Prayers. Why it was never finished. 

George Plimpton:There are theories that he did finish it and destroyed it. He was very much a stylist, very much concerned with-- with writing the perfect sentence, so it's possible that he had finished this thing and taken a look. He did destroy one book before that, a book called Summer Crossing, and destroyed it completely. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:He had destroyed short stories that he had written. So it may have been written and destroyed. It may have been finished-- Joanne Carson says that he gave her a key to a safety deposit box and intimated that the-- indicated that the novel was in there. And she gave this key to Alan Schwartz, who was Truman Capote's lawyer. And I asked Alan Schwartz about this and at first he said, ``No, I don't remember ever getting a key.'' But then just as I was leaving his house on the way to the airport, he said, ``You know, you're right. Joanne Carson did give me a key, but I have no idea what safety deposit box it fits.'' I mean, there are millions of those things around and I don't know how you ever would tell. So it may be that the thing sits in-- 

Charlie Rose:But he never told her-- 

George Plimpton:--Chicago or-- 

Charlie Rose:--according to her, as to where it was? 

George Plimpton:He never told her where it was. He joked with her about it. ``It may be in St. Louis. It may be here.'' 

Charlie Rose:A couple of things about that. One is that after, you know, the execution and after the fall from society's embrace, he began to drink a lot and you'd see him on television a couple of times-- 

George Plimpton:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:--and he was just in terrible shape, sloshing his words and-- 

George Plimpton:He was-- you know, it's odd about television. Television was really what-- what made him, in a sense-- fame-- and also destroyed him. I think-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. He had a great face for television because it was large. 

George Plimpton:It was large, and that funny voice, and you heard him there, a great story teller. And as soon as he walked on, there was a sort of an electric-- 

Charlie Rose:Because he'd say anything. 

George Plimpton:--thing about-- he'd say anything. Nobody knew what he was going to say. And yet, if you do go on television, you're seen by four or five million people, you become famous on television and you enjoy it and you enjoy mesmerizing people, it's very hard to go back to a cork-lined room, if you will, and start writing on a yellow pad, which is the way he wrote. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. It's the danger of fame. 

George Plimpton:And it's the danger of fame and I think that, as much as anything, destroyed him. 

Charlie Rose:He died living in Hollywood in a room. And Joanne Carson, one of Johnny Carson's wives, who had befriended him, I guess, because she knew him at the United Nations Plaza, when she was married to-- 

George Plimpton:That's right. Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:--Johnny. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. He went out there. He took-- he bought a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. By this time, it was just before his 60th birthday. In fact, he was going to sit around with Joanne Carson and they were going to make up a birthday-- they were going to make a party list very much like the black-and-white ball and have a party. But he-- at that time, his body had sort of given up on him and it's a very tragic-- what a remarkable scene, the two of them together. In the oral biography, Joanne talks about how he would come out there and they wouldn't go anywhere, they would light all these votive candles and they would sit there and they were pretend that they were going on these trips. And Truman would produce-- he used to steal art books from people and he would cut things out and he'd collect these things-- 

Charlie Rose:Yes! 

George Plimpton:--and then he would say, ``We're going to go to Paris today.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. This is a great story. 

George Plimpton:And he would put all these pictures out and they would look at them. And they'd go to the Louvre-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:--and they'd do that and-- 

Charlie Rose:All in the room. 

George Plimpton:All in this one room. And then they would order a French meal in, which would arrive with (unintelligible) poisson. And then the next day they would go to Spain and there would be the pictures-- a very touching business. And then, finally, they were going to go to China. 

Charlie Rose:How good a writer was he? What's his-- where does he go down? 

George Plimpton:Well, I think-- I think-- who was it, Somerset Maugham, that said he was on the top of the second tier. I think that's probably where Truman-- 

Charlie Rose:That's the way they rank presidents. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. And I think that-- I think that's probably where-- where Truman belongs. He's obviously below-- the main reason being, of course, that none of his fiction really has terrific substance to it. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:You know, Holly Golightly and those characters are not really the most-- 

Charlie Rose:He admired Faulkner a lot. 

George Plimpton:Yeah. And-- 

Charlie Rose:According to the book. 

George Plimpton:Oh, sure. I would think that, as a stylist, he'd be really up there among the best. I mean, you-- there's hardly a bad sentence in Truman Capote, no matter where you read it. But I mean, compared to his contemporaries -- James Jones and William Styron and Saul Bellow and people like that -- I don't see how you can put him up into that specific tier because he didn't write particularly about serious subjects. 

Charlie Rose:What's your next subject for an oral-- this kind of work? 

George Plimpton:I don't know. It's very hard-- 

Charlie Rose:Having laid out the-- having laid out-- 

George Plimpton:Yeah, I-- 

Charlie Rose:--the conditions that you have to find before you can engage. 

George Plimpton:I was thinking of Leonard Bernstein as being a possibility-- 

Charlie Rose:That's a great idea. 

George Plimpton:--but I don't know whether there-- one of the problems is that so many books have been written about Lenny. What could you really find out that-- that you wouldn't find in those biographies? Someone has suggested Frank Sinatra (unintelligible) Frank Sinatra just on music. How wonderful it would be to get the people, the musicians that had played with him and listened to him and let them talk. John Lahr did a wonderful piece in The New Yorker about-- some time-- a couple of months ago about Sinatra and music and I thought, ``Gosh, I'd like to see the raw transcripts of John Lahr's''-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:--``talk with these people.'' He did a wonderful thing. Anyway, but what wonderful fun it would have been to hear these voices firsthand. 

Charlie Rose:Speaking of The New Yorker, your friend and mine, Brendan Gill, died over the holidays. 

George Plimpton:Oh, what a tragedy. How sad. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Remember him for us because we're going to see something that he did with me here on this program. 

George Plimpton:Well, I think what one remembered about Brendan was just the huge energy of the man. He got up in the morning and just shouted, ``What a wonderful thing it is to wake up.'' And he lived a whole day like that. There was a word he kept using. What was it? ``Fenestation,'' which is-- means to-- it means to walk at a-- to be hurried, to walk at a terrific pace. I mean, to walk down 5th Avenue with him is like going over hurdles on his way to his clubs and so forth. 

Charlie Rose:Yes! 

George Plimpton:He loved New York with a huge passion. Of course, had a great deal to do with saving New York, as we know it-- the Municipal Art Society-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, he and Mrs. Onassis and others-- 

George Plimpton:They saved the Grand Central Station. They did a sorts of extraordinary things. The wonderful thing about Brendan was you could not  go into a building without him having some sort of a story about it. I mean, I can remember going to the River House and he said, ``Do you realize''-- and he had this wonderful-- he always spoke as if he didn't quite believe what he was going to say, which made him a wonderful story teller. He talked about, ``Do you realize, in this lobby, that they brought this man in drunk one-- and he turned out to be-- and there was a murder''-- I mean, he had the-- he had an immense curiosity about-- 

Charlie Rose:He had a certain dignity and bearing about him that carried to-- 

George Plimpton:He was a-- the energy is what I remember, that he was-- he went to four or five parties an evening. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. There are people here that do that, don't they! 

George Plimpton:Yeah. Had a dinner jacket in his office, which he would get into. The other thing that I thought was so wonderful about him was that he was so kind, in a way. He talked a lot about-- that you should have, particularly as you got older, a ``sweetness toward life.'' And I thought that was a wonderful way of expressing-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

George Plimpton:--something. Most people, when they get older -- he was 83 -- become sort of crotchety and-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Exactly. 

George Plimpton:--they get an angle on life that's not a particularly pleasant one. But Brendan-- I mean, I can't believe he's gone. He had more-- I just can't believe he's not going to come in here. I mean, he was ubiquitous. He was everywhere. He was wonderful. 

Charlie Rose:He is on tape, George. Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career, by George Plimpton. As always, thank you. 

George Plimpton:A great pleasure. 

Charlie Rose:And here, as we leave you, Brendan Gill. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow night. This city-- what does it mean to you?
