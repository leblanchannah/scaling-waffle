Institute, NDI, which, for 15 years, has brought the power of movement to inner city children, the physically disabled, and even New York City cops. Also joining us is Gerald Arpino, artistic director and cofounder of the Joffrey Ballet. He also works with children. Right now he has 66 of them on stage at City Center, the Joffrey's production of The Nutcracker. Thank you for coming. Pleasure to have both of you. 

Thank you. 

Do you two - obviously you know each other, you know, but do you talk? 

Wait. Wait. I used to stand behind him at the barre at the ballet school, and when I'd do grand battements, which is big kicks, I'd try and kick him. I remember, I was a brat. I used to chase him all around, he and Eddie Villella in the locker room at the American School. They were always boxing and fighting in there. 

Back then - you mentioned Villella - did you guys - did everybody know who was going to really emerge? Was it clear then who the stars would be? 

Oh, they were the stars before I was. I was emerging. They were emerging because they were Mr. Balanchine's, the kids, you know. And Bob Joffrey and I were down in the Village. We were in a loft trying to make it. Well, they were the stars, Eddie Villella and Joffrey. I used to love him. I used to bravo him and see him all the time. But now I hired his son. 

Yeah, Christopher. 

Christopher did a work - 

His son works for you? 

Oh, yes. I commissioned a work by him which was - he's very gifted. Your son is - 

Chris, he runs the Pennsylvania Ballet and he wants to choreograph and direct, and he is, and he's really good. Gerry gave him a big - 

And I would get him in the office and I'd say, "Do you realize what you've let yourself into as becoming an artistic director? You don't know how life - how wonderful life was before you became an artistic director," I said, and I would give Christopher all this advice about boards - 

Fundraising. 

Fundraising, all the involvement of what it is to be an artistic director. I didn't know I was going to be an artistic director when Bob Joffrey died, and, of course, there I am. I was a choreographer, always in the studio working, working, working, but loving it, every minute of it. And now I have the other side, and of course I went for a big battle last - 

Yeah, we're going to talk about that a little bit later. Do you remember when you and I first met in Texas? 

Yes, I do. 

When the Joffrey came down and I had this little show there, and we talked about ballet even then. You have four children? Yeah. Two girls, two boys, is that - am I - 

I have twin daughters and two boys. 

Yeah. Now, how many of them are in the world of dance? 

Well, Christopher and Charlotte. And my oldest son, George, works in Boulder, Colorado with juvenile delinquents. And then Charlotte has a twin sister, Catherine, who's in Santa Fe running a day camp. 

Here's my question. Is it a gift that you have or is it something that simply you learn because when you, you know, were 15 I think you were when you started with the New York City Ballet, didn't you? 

Yeah, I started performing, actually earlier, with Ballet Society, but 15 I joined - 

Was it a gift that you have or is it something that you've developed? 

The gift was that there was only two boys around and there was no choice for poor Mr. Balanchine. We were it. I don't know. It was just luck. 

He has created more ballets for you than anyone else, of all the dancers. 

Yeah, I counted them all once and I kind of figured that's right. 

Yeah. What do you teach children? What do you say to them and why do you tell them ballet is important or why do you tell them it's beautiful? 

I tell them dance is important. I tell them ballet isn't for them unless they're special. But the dance is much - 

"Special" meaning what? 

Well, because it's a special form of dance. It's one special form of dance. Dance is so much bigger. Dance is extraordinary, profound, and it really is as important as time and space. 

But do you say only the most gifted will be able to do ballet, will be able to perform ballet, but anybody can maximize their sense of movement and their appreciation of their body and their appreciation of form and movement? 

Even you, Charles, even you. There's hope. 

See how he says "even." 

No, we have - the problem is that, you see, it is important for children to have the best of everything. And we are at a particular time where, you know, the voices you read in the papers and the government says the arts are so important, education, but they do it. They talk it but they don't it. 

"They" being the government doesn't? 

Yes, and funding. You know, it's easy to get billions of dollars, you know, for people that cheat in banks and everything, you bail them out, but you can't get a thousand dollars, a hundred dollars or something to help a child have a chance and motivate in their life. So, you know, we decided this year that we're going to try our first benefit. We're going to ask artists to help artists. And I asked Isaac Stern to come play a little bit, and Judy Collins, and artists are giving works. And suddenly I thought - 

To raise a little money or? 

Yeah. And I suddenly thought, look, to heck with everything else, let's help each other. 

It's the right way. That's exactly what I said to Christopher. 

So do you need any money? I'll give you some and you give me a - 

Oh, absolutely. You know, I told Christopher if he wanted to borrow some of the sets, I think it's time. I think it's time that we become an active and productive people again. I think what the world needs are more artists because we know where it's at. And I don't understand why. I just came from Washington and they called me an "Italian American." I thought I was always an American, but I appeared in front of the - as an "Italian American," you know. 

Oh, is this because they were honoring Italian Americans? 

Yes, the National Italian American Association was giving - gave all their awards to the most prominent Italian Americans, you know. And I had to get - they called me the "Columbus of the dance" because I started out with a station wagon and a U-Haul trailer. 

And got lost right away. 

No, I didn't. 

Just like Columbus. 

No, the thing was I didn't have the Nina or the Santa Maria or the Pinta, but I did have Nina Gustafson (ph) whose daughter I was dating who loaned me a station wagon, and that's how the Joffrey started. 

Yeah. How did you meet Bob Joffrey? 

Oh, Bob Joffrey and I go back - our families knew each other, and then I was in Coast Guard uniform and I was - my family told me to look up the Joffrey family. His mother was Italian, his father was Afghan. And so there was Bob. And I didn't know anything, you know. And I had just turned over the frigate - it was the end of the war and I turned over the frigate to the Russians, and they came on and they were doing all the kazatskies, and I thought, you know, here are these - we were always so uptight, you know, when we were aboard ship. And here they came on drinking the vodka and dancing all over the ship that we had just given to them. 

Free spirits. 

Yeah, you know, the end of the war they made that whole trade and we gave them the frigate and I was aboard. And so I was let go in Seattle. I finished my time. And so I looked up Bob's family and there he was in a Russian - he was with Novikoff. 

It's not the school (inaudible)? 

Yeah, the school, Novikoff. And then it started. So I took my first lesson in my Coast Guard trousers. I didn't know a thing, except I saw these other guys aboard ship dancing, and I always wanted to dance, you know. I mean, I was an athlete. But being an Italian American, you know, it wasn't considered - 

Being an Italian American what? 

And Italian American male and coming from a family of baseball players and football players, you know, they thought I'd gone off the deep end. My family, you know, just didn't know what to make of it, you know. 

What did your mother say? 

Oh, my mother, all she said were Hail Mary's. She'd go to church and she'd say the rosary constantly to "get my son back." 

She speeded up her rosary. 

She did. She did. She just prayed. 

Left baseballs in your room. 

Yeah. Well it was the same with Eddie Villella. I mean, you remember when Eddie went and joined - when he went up to the Marines. What was it that - 

Merchant Marines. 

Merchant Marines. Because his mother came to Bob Joffrey, he was a pupil of Bob Joffrey. 

And said what, "Give me back my son?" 

No. "I've got to take my son out of this," you know. His sister wanted to dance and he went there and he got a degree. He left. No, it was rather a disgrace for a man actually to enter the theater and so forth, and being Catholic American and Italian. So when I was down with these Italian Americans I said, you know, "I really deserve this award because you guys have made it so difficult for me to become an artist in my own country." They put all these blockades against you, you know. You get beat up if you showed your ballet shoes, you know. But the point was that - but it - 

You met Bob Joffrey. 

Yeah, I met Bob Joffrey. 

And you two cofounded the Joffrey Ballet, and the rest is history. And he dies in what year, what was it? 

He died in '88. 

And how old was he? 

Bob was 54, I believe. 

Yeah. He named you as the artistic director in his will. 

Yes. 

And then they tried to take it away from you or tried to force you out, or at least you thought that the actions they were taking were intended to do that, and you fought back. 

Yes, I did. 

What did you do? 

Well I actually felt that I had - 

And who is "they"? 

Well, there were certain members of the board who wanted to arrest the artistic direction from me and take over the artistic direction of the company that Bob and I had founded, and take over the whole vision, the concepts of this major company. 

And you thought they wanted to do it because they wanted to make room for some of their own family. 

Well that was part of it, but not really. I think the intention was - I think the group that had intended to take over, in their own way were seeking the power - artistic power. 

I bet you were following this with great - 

Well, sure. It's always the case whenever a founder starts something, the minute it's successful, you know, when it's not successful, you know, you just get a bunch of people that help a little bit, but the minute it gets successful they suddenly want to dump the people that started it and take over. 

You know, I thought one of the smart things you did is that you refused to let them use your choreograph - you refused to allow your ballets that you had created to be performed by the Joffrey, correct? 

Oh, absolutely. 

You said, "No way." 

Well, I created over 50 ballets, you know, a third of the whole repertoire is mine. And I just couldn't allow this ignominious act to go against every artist. I felt here I had dedicated my whole entire life to what I believe in, what this country is about, the principles on which I was ready to die for, so I stood up and said - I went and laid my life on - I said, "To each of you" - I said, "But I will not support this ignominious act that's being perpetrated against every artist not only in my country but in the world." It is a right for the artist to have his control of his artistic vision and the things he builds. You build what you wish to build. But there's no right for another man to go in and take away that goal, that vision. 

And you finally won because what, because - 

I won because I resigned. 

Because you were tough first. 

And I was very tough. I played hardball. I took my ballets. I said I will not support this act because it violates every principles on which Bob Joffrey and myself founded this company. 

How is it doing financially now? 

Well, financially, now, thank God, even in a recession I was able to raise over $2 million with - yes - with all of a new board and my new support. 

Wow. 

Because you see, this is what I'm saying about our country. Our country needs this kind of leadership. 

I want to touch you because a little luck may rub off. 

Well you can have it - it will. Jacques, you know it will. 

Oh, it's so hard. I think it's great. Good for you. 

No, it's not hard. No, what you're doing is so inspiring. Don't you think I follow? Yeah. 

You mean with the kids? 

Oh, absolutely. What each of us are doing are right on, it's what this country needs. 

Which is what? 

What it needs is leadership. It needs the inspiration, not to be lied to, not to be - but be inspired so that each of us can create and produce and give back. 

You think the government should subsidize the arts more, should subsidize - even though you may not like that word -- or support the arts more by providing more funds? Jacques, do you? 

I'm ambiguous about - I don't like the idea of government funding, because then they start telling you what you have to do, and artists should be free to do. But can you imagine any country that says we have a culture and yet we don't support it, because arts and science, those are our culture, and to say, you know, "Oh, well, we're a cultured nation," but we don't support the arts. 

Where is - I mentioned "The Nutcracker." That's an annual for you guys. 

Oh, yes. And you must all come to see "The Nutcracker." I mean, that's a way of supporting the arts. But not only that, but it's such a treat, our "Nutcracker." I mean, I was brought up on your "Nutcracker," New York City Ballet. 

Not Nutcracker, please. 

But our "Nutcracker," which, you see, Bob Joffrey was born on Christmas Eve. 

Was he? 

Yes. His mother was Mary and his father's name was Joseph. And we had - 

Is that true? 

It's the truth. It's the truth. I never speak a lie. 

Oh, my gosh. 

See what you learn if you come to this program. 

That was his last gift. I learn a lot by watching your program. I watch your program every night. And so the point that I'm making is that it was his last gift. Bob was a Santa Claus. He was a Drosselmeyer. Christmas Eve he was - he was born on Christmas Eve and that was the evening, I mean, when he would gather the entire company and he's sit there and have a gift for each of us. He was the most inspiring director. Well, you knew Bob. 

Okay, tell me, where is "The Nutcracker" again, one more time. 

It's going to be at City Center. And we're going this week. 

It's going now. 

Yes. And we close - our last performance is this Sunday. And please, do come and see "The Nutcracker." It is a beautiful production. It's a Victorian production. We have 60 children in it. And it is different from any - 

And these children come from? 

From the school. From the Joffrey School. And they're quite - 

And they're all ages? I mean, how old? 

All ages. They range from five to about 12. And they are absolutely - you know what it is to come up against a child. 

What are you doing? 

Now I'm trying to put this company that I started 15 years ago into a permanent institution that will outlast me and go on to be a model. It's already a model for how art should be in education and the lives of children. I'd like to see that all over the country and I'd like to see it continue for hundreds of years. 

To bring the awareness of the arts to children who may not have that privilege by - 

All children. 

-- their economic circumstances or otherwise. 

That's right. But when you have an affluent family, if they want their children to have piano lessons or music or dance or poetry or go to the theater, they can afford it. So we end up with mostly children at camp. 

And that luxury and that option should not just be, you know, a privilege of the rich and those that have - are fortunate to have those parents. Your mother - I should tell this story, which I think is true. Did your mother, in order to get you in balance in school, have one of her kids come and wash the floor or something? 

Yeah, it was - 

So you could go in or? 

My older brother, John, used to clean the floor because we had a scholarship and it was a way of paying back. 

Yeah. 

Used to mop the floors. 

The sacrifice to be able to go to school and - 

Yeah. So we could have dance lessons. 

It's nice to meet you. 

Nice to meet you, too. 

Pleasure to have you on the broadcast. 

Oh, Charles, thank you. Thank you. I do want to be the Joe Papp of the dance one day, though, I really do. 

Keep it up. Keep it up. 

Big act to follow. 

Pleasure to have both of you. When we come back Michael York will be here straight from the theater where he's acting in "The Crucible."
