Steve Coll is here. He is the dean of Columbia Journalism School. He's also a staff writer for "The New Yorker Magazine." His latest piece in this week's issue is called Rex Tillerson Is Still Acting Like a CEO. It takes a look at Tillerson's relationship with the press. The secretary's trip to Asia last week became the subject of controversy when Tillerson announced that he would not be traveling with the diplomatic press corps. Tillerson has come under fire for his media silence since taking office, neglecting what many view as an integral part of the role as secretary of state. Coll's 2012 book, "Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power" is a study of the oil giant and its role in world affairs. I am pleased to have Steve Coll back at this table, welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

I can imagine now, I've said this before, it is an exciting time and I can't remember more exciting time to be a reporter, to be a journalist, to be looking at what's happening in the world. 

Yes. It is an exciting time to be at a journalism school as well, all these young reporters going out into this environment, trying to figure out how to do their job professionally. It's a time I think when the attacks on the press have actually strengthened the press, made clearer what our role is under our constitutional system, and also raise the bar on our performance. We've got to be good now, we're going to have to earn it in this environment of kind of trying to de-legitimatize the press or divide the press, so, yes, an exciting time to be in this profession. 

Did we as journalists, or should we as journalists, have learned something from the campaign? 

Absolutely. Yes, I think there were lots of misses in the run-up to the election by journalism writ large. Of course we have lots of journalism in this country now. It's part of the story, our media is fragmented. But there was an over reliance on prediction, an over reliance on data science, and we've lost a lot of professional reporting in the heartland of the country where the election was decided. It used to be, 20 years ago, that there were very healthy newspaper newsrooms in all of these cities and even midtowns, and they were feeding through wire services and syndication services into the networks, into the two coasts, and I don't think we would have been quite so surprised in New York and California on the whole -- 

If we had access to what they were saying? 

Yes. A lot of reporting in Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin that was done by major news organizations was parachute reporting, it wasn't coming out of those states, those newsrooms with the same kind of pulsing power that it used to have. And I also think, certainly, at journalism school, we wrestle with the role of big data in this world, and the way journalism now requires computational skills and data science skills, that's all true. But there was a little bit of an over reliance on data science prediction in this election, and an under-reliance of knocking on doors and going into key districts. 

What we used to call the shoe leather stuff. 

Yes, I remember at "The Washington Post" 15, 20 years ago, there was a ritual in the general election, guys like Dan Balz and David Broder would choose like 12 swing districts, and they would go out and they would stand in front lawns and knock on people's door and say, what's on your mind, what issues are driving you, what are you thinking? And it wasn't to predict the result, but when you read their 3,000 word omnibus report of all of these voices, and they would take advantage of their experience, going back to these places and you had a sense of where it was going. At least it was an authentic role of journalism. It wasn't trying to give you a mathematical number of the likelihood of an outcome. It was going out into these communities and letting voters be heard on the eve of the election. So I think we missed doing some of that this time around. 

There's also this. It is the first time that I can remember, even though they may have felt it, candidates said that the press was the enemy. 

Well, one candidate who is now the president of the United States said that. 

I know that, but that's my point. 

Yes. That's a real -- 

I mean, others, I mean, you always had, among politicians, the feeling that they didn't get a fair shake. 

Yes. 

But here you had somebody really took on the press in the campaign as the enemy. 

Yes. And that was part of a strategy of populism and the de-legitimization of critics that has extended to the judiciary, to the federal bureaucracy. When you have the president of the United States on his first day in office apparently telephoning someone at the National Park Service to complain about their posting a photograph that he didn't like of his inauguration crowds, you know you're in a new world of presidential conduct. 

Or you have a new kind of president. 

Yes, a new kind of -- yes. And so, I think overall, my sense is that the press is used to being attacked. I mean, if you're a reporter and you haven't been yelled at by your subjects a few times, you're not doing your job. 

Right. 

And so, I don't think the press has been shaken by those kinds of assaults. I worry about the de-legitimization of our constitutional design by all of this incendiary speech that seeks to personalize or de-legitimatize the functions of judges and professional reporters. And people at the National Park Service who are serving their -- the taxpayers. So I worry about a strategy of trying to just kind of change the contours of how our system is supposed to work, but as to the press being called out, come on, we're used to that, we should shoulder it, and just get on with our jobs. 

That's exactly what I say when people ask me that, I say we should just do our job. 

Yes. 

You know, and not worry about anything else, do our job. But when you look now at the idea of fake news and not an acceptance of what facts are, that seems to portend something different. 

Well unfortunately, this term, "fake news," has now been highjacked for it to mean news I don't like. It started out to describe something more specific and more worrisome, which was the manufacturing of deliberately false information, sometimes for commercial purposes. 

Right. 

In sort of offshore little businesses, and then distributing that across social media platforms and making money off of the advertising that was available because it clicked. Some of this manufactured news, which wasn't done for ideological reasons in some cases, as I say, it was done to make money, did focus on Trump because people clicked on those stories. Then you have another category of news which is maybe disinformation or heavily ideological news, very difficult to determine, it's an eye-of-the-beholder question as to when something is so distorted, so deliberately constructed to mislead that it crosses from just being a hard opinion into being an active disinformation campaign, but there is also quite a lot of flow across social media of essentially partially invented stories that mislead, for ideological or political purposes. And, look, the social media platforms are the story here, I think, not because they're solely responsible for this problem, but they represent a profound change in the way news is distributed in our democracy. So newspapers used to control their distribution system right down to the driveway where the paperboy toss the paper, the networks had a clear pathway from their newsrooms to their audiences sitting at appointment television. Now essentially the people who create news have lost control of its distribution because the most important way that it's distributed is through Facebook and other social media platforms. And those companies see themselves as neutral, they don't see themselves as editors or gatekeepers, their idea is that whoever -- 

They're just the distribution path. 

Yes, a kind of platform for exchange, free exchange, and it's difficult for them to accept responsibility for policing a public square of sorts that they've created, which is quite profitable for them. And so, I don't think we've gotten very far in resolving the challenge that this election has presented to us, and I feel pretty sure that it's going to get worse next time around. 

In the next election? 

Yes, because people have learned how to do this, and they -- the power of social media platforms as a distribution arm for news is not going to go away between now and 2020. And I think the companies, Facebook is, you know, trying to figure out what it can do, what it should do, it is at least stepping forward to engage around these questions, but I'm not sure that they're going to be in a position to prevent this kind of campaigning in the future, or that it is in their business interest to do so. So I think this is not just something in the rearview mirror. This is something that is going to shape our democracy. 

And how can you define what the use of Twitter by this president has done? 

Well, it's interesting. You know, the media, of course, and the role of media in politics has changed as the technology has changed. So remember when President Reagan came to town, and he was a master of television, and he and Mike Deaver modeled this presidency of going over the heads of the working press by stage managing the president's speech and appearances and his power and so forth, and everyone remarked on how successfully he had done an end-run around the press using television. Well, President Trump has done the same thing using Twitter, which is, he has managed to break out of the constraints that presidents either choose to impose on their communication because they want a more elegant and more constrained -- 

Yes, but he's done it to his own detriment. Many would argue, even, including people I think within his own close advisors, who, because it takes him off message and creates a whole distraction. 

Yes. 

That does not allow what may have been, after that speech, a positive message. 

Yes, I mean, I think every political consultant in the country would agree with that. There's no question about it. I'm struck. I'm sure -- it's a little bit disconcerting, but the power of that platform, the way he uses it to reach right into your pocket. You know, you wake up in the morning, you flip your phone on and there's the president of the United States, saying something, look what he has done again. And it's that populist strategy of being able to speak directly to the people in the name of the people without gatekeepers, without advisors, without consultants. That's been his conceit throughout. And he is a professional entertainer, right? He knows how to control a stage and a live set. He knows how to use confrontation to create drama, that may be no way to run a country, but it is his instinct about how to communicate. And I'm not sure that he's going to be able to relinquish it, judging by the pattern so far, which is, there seems to be certain hours of the day where he just -- he must, he must react. 

Are there discussions among deans of journalism schools and editors of papers about, so where are we and what do we do other than the very basic thing, we do our job? 

We had a convening at the school a few weeks ago with editors from mainstream press. We had an editor from Breitbart there about covering the Trump presidency. 

Right. 

I think in the end, everyone circles around to what you said, which is that we don't need to lose confidence in our role under the first amendment. We know through experience and our professional lives what to do, and we know what the questions are. This is a remarkable constitutional scenario. Just on the admissions that were made in the Congress yesterday, where the FBI director says that members of the president's campaign team are under active investigation because of concerns about their contacts with Russia. We know -- 

The word collusion was used. 

Collusion. And we know that from, at least according to 17 or 18 intelligence agencies, that the Russian intelligence services carried out a deliberate effort to disrupt the 2016 election. 

And to influence its outcome beyond just disrupt. 

Yes. 

I mean, the argument is made -- 

Yes, absolutely. 

-- that they have evidence that it was intended to benefit one candidate more than the other. 

So step back in American history, I mean, tell me when in the first 100 days of a new presidency you've had a situation where the FBI is investigating people close to the president for colluding with a foreign government that has taken hostile action against the United States in order to affect the outcome of its election? I mean, it's been awhile since we've had a constitutional scenario like this. Never mind the travel ban, the courts trying to intervene in the president's immigration policy, the president calling them "so-called judges," I mean, we can't normalize the situation. This is a real series of departures in our recent, certainly, our post-war experience. 

And then there is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Now, you wrote the big book about ExxonMobil, who is not going to the NATO conference, I assume, because he's going to be down in Florida where the president of China is visiting the president of the United States. Now, you know, how do you balance that? 

Yes. 

Where should he be? And he just returned from a trip to the Far East. 

Right. 

You know, I mean, I think you could argue that he may be better off down there because of that crucial relationship, than at NATO. 

Yes, it sounds like they messed up the scheduling about that. I'm not so worried about that. I take note, however, that the Secretary of State does not have a deputy even nominated. He doesn't have any undersecretaries nominated. He doesn't have any assistant secretaries nominated. He's endorsed a 30 percent reduction in the budget of the State Department, and he basically doesn't have a team. He doesn't have a relationship with the White House. You know, it's normal for secretaries of state to come in without a tight relationship with the president's aides and his campaign team. Remember when Secretary Clinton came in, having run a very bitter campaign against President Obama, and it took her team a while and Obama's team a while to communicate, make nice with one another, but she succeeded because she understood how to use the bully pulpit of the State Department to make herself felt, to be just -- the Secretary of State is second most important spokesperson of the government after the president. It's your opportunity, it's your job to get out there and talk about America's place in the world, about foreign policy. And one of the tricks that the last secretary, last five Secretaries of State have modeled is how you use that speech, that bully pulpit to gain influence inside the cabinet, inside the White House, you make yourself a force by your opportunity to speak almost distinctively on behalf of the United States. You think about the last five secretaries that we had, John Kerry, a professional politician, almost president of the United States. Hillary Clinton, candidate for president, battle-scarred senator. Condoleezza Rice, very formidable public figure who had vast experience at the White House before she took over Secretary of State, proved to be a very -- Colin Powell, one of the most eminent Americans of his generation. Madeleine Albright, first woman to hold the seat and who rose to the opportunity to speak about big ideas all around the world. So it doesn't really matter about which party or what the ideological profile of the administration is, that's the model of how you do the job effectively, I think, overall. And the irony of Secretary Tillerson is that when he does talk, you can see he's still learning what the difference is between running a giant corporation and speaking on behalf of the United States, and foreign policy is. But he's comfortable in conversation. He knows a lot of these issues. He's perfectly capable of taking the heat of dealing with free -- 

You wrote a book about ExxonMobil but he never sat for an interview with you. 

No, he didn't. I chased him around like Johnny reporter because he wouldn't sit down across the table, so I would go to his public speeches and stand in the audience and raise my hand. And so I watched him though -- these were very controlled settings, the typical format was he would read a prepared speech, but he'd take some questions from the audience, and they weren't generally professional journalists who were as knowledgeable as he was about, say, Northeast Asia, which would be what would happen if you had the diplomatic press on his plane. But, you know, they were smart people and sometimes questions would be challenging, he could handle this stuff. He's chief executive of a company for ten years, of course he can handle it. 

Not just any company, biggest company in the world. 

And travels around the world, he knows Mid-East, he certainly knows the leadership of a lot of countries. 

Should that by definition make him, give him the tools to be a good secretary of state? 

I think the job has several components. One of them involves negotiating in private, super well-qualified to do that, of course, and that negotiating grid usually includes leaders or foreign ministers. 

Most of the negotiation is in private, isn't it? 

In American diplomacy? 

As Secretary of State, yeah. 

Well, semi-private, a lot of it is -- 

I don't think John Kerry was telling us what was going on -- the diplomacy of Iran. 

Yes, but he was out talking to foreign press, to foreign legislatures, all the time that he was talking privately with Russians and Syrians, and you have to play at all of those levels. I mean, look, we are an open society, a democracy, so you need to be accountable to your own public, but all of our allies are also democracies. It is their decision making about whether or not they are going to go into, say, for example, a more confrontational risky posture about North Korea. That decision is going to be a function of domestic politics in Japan, South Korea, Australia, the European Union, so where is that politics shaped? It is shaped by parliaments, by opposition parties, by the press in those countries. And so if you think you are going to change a construct of regional policy in Asia without speaking aloud to all of those parliaments and publics that are your allies, I think you are not going to get there. I mean, there are few kinds of negotiations like preparing for a secret opening with Cuba or Nixon to China or, you know, close the doors and let's try to get the Middle East solved kind of negotiation that you can do entirely like a deal negotiation, but most diplomacy is multiple, multiple dimensions at the same time, and it must involve public communication. 

And you need a full team to do it. 

You need a full team to do it, and would it be natural for someone coming in as an outsider, even someone with rich corporate experience and leadership experience to complement himself with a deputy who knows the system, knows the building, knows the diplomatic service, knows how the embassies are administered, knows how the National Security Council works. And he had someone, Elliott Abrams, who he selected for that position, it was exactly that kind of character, and was turned down by the Trump White House apparently because they thought Abrams wasn't loyal enough during the campaign. 

It seems to me that things are still being influenced greatly by factions within the White House. 

Yes. These are small group of people who seem to be in every photograph that -- 

But at odds with each other, too, in terms of -- 

Yes. I mean, the degree of leaking from this presidency is certainly on the top end of any Washington transition that I have experienced. Usually this doesn't happen quite so fast, and it suggests that there are a lot of conflicting individuals and groupings within the White House, but maybe also -- you look back at the president's business history and you see one where there's a lot of transactions, a lot of people in it for themselves. It is not -- this is not, you know, sort of a family candy company that he ran, so he seems to cultivate a little bit of combat among his advisers and one way to play that conflict is through the press. 

So do I hear you say in the end that he was not a good choice? 

Tillerson? 

Yes. 

I don't know. I feel like he hasn't demonstrated yet whether he can rise to the occasion. He said in this interview that he had took one reporter, did one interview, and he said. 

Why did he take her? 

I don't know. She did a decent job in the interview. She certainly pressed him on the press access question a few times. She doesn't know northeast Asia as well as the diplomatic press corps. But she works for a digital website whose chief executive, as I understand it, was a former communications specialist for the Republican Party, so I think there has been a general privileging of kind of partisan media in the White House, so be it, but she did a professional job. I think one thing he said to her when she asked him several times about press access was hey, I have only been on the job six weeks, be patient. All right, fair enough. But this cannot go on for six months this way because I don't think it is effective, either within the State Department, the cabinet, or as a strategy of carrying out diplomacy. 

This is what else he told her, he said, "He understood that as Secretary of State, he is now accountable to the American public, but he added that he was determined to do things his way because at ExxonMobil, he had been very successful diplomatically over 25 years by staying quiet and letting the governments he negotiated with manage their own domestic politics. This is a narrow conception of "diplomacy," however, one where bargains are struck on the basis of private interests." That was said by you in your article. 

Yes, that is my argument. I mean, I suppose you can take the other view which is that we can go back to a kind of 19th century diplomacy where the Secretary of State is really just out there negotiating, a kind of special envoy role, but A
