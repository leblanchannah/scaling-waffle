Unknown Speaker:dreamed of being on stage. By the age of 22, he was starring on Broadway in Stephen Sondheim's Merrily We Roll Along. By 29 he'd won a Tony for his work in Jerome Robbins' Broadway. Since theater was his first love, he never thought that his greatest success would come from television. For the past nine years he has played the role of George Costanza on the hit show Seinfeld. Here it is. 

Jason Alexander:We were engaged to be married. We bought the wedding invitations, and-- yada, yada, yada, I'm still single. 

Actress:So what's she doing now? 

Jason Alexander:Yada. I love talking to you! 

Actress:Me, too. So speaking of accidents, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and yada, yada, yada. Anyway, I'm really tired today. 

Charlie Rose:So, there it is. Welcome, sir. 

Jason Alexander:There it is. Thank you. 

Charlie Rose:That's the point. 

Jason Alexander:That's about it. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. You've been asked this a thousand times. What's the-- how do you explain it, that one show captured the ethos of its time? 

Jason Alexander:You know, if we could explain it, we probably would have screwed it up. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Exactly. If you knew it was happening, it would have screwed it up. 

Jason Alexander:It was-- I actually did bet money against it. Jerry and I had a little wager after the pilot. He said, ''What do you think?'' And I said, ''No way.'' 

Charlie Rose:''This is not going to make it.'' 

Jason Alexander:And he said, ''Why?' ' I said, ''Well, the show-- I mean, I love the show and the audience for the show is me, but I don't watch TV, so who's coming?'' You know, ''This is a slightly more sophisticated level of comedy and it's not what television is used to and I just-- I don't think we're going to get anybody.'' And it started by attracting exactly me-- you know, college boys, young men in their mid- to late-20s. That was our key, core audience. But then, all of a sudden, children were watching, 8, 9, 10 years old-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--and my mother's generation, people in their 60s and 70s and 80s were-- And we started going international and people from other countries were-- and we just said, ''What are they getting?'' 

Charlie Rose:What were they getting? 

Jason Alexander:I imagine the children, I assume, were laughing at Michael's antics-- you know, falling down-- 

Charlie Rose:Sure. Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--bumping into things. 

Charlie Rose:Right. Right. 

Jason Alexander:I guess our parents saw us in the characters and, you know, what they consider their ''crazy kids.'' And I guess, to some degree, in trying to examine the minutiae of a very specific human experience, of urban living at a certain age, and at this period of time, somehow we tapped into something universal. Somehow, the little disturbances of daily life are more universal than we know. And because the show was dedicated entirely to the laugh and nothing else-- there was no attempt at learning-- 

Charlie Rose:There was no message there, was there! 

Jason Alexander:--or growth or messages, it was just-- we would do anything and everything, and sacrifice anything, to achieve the laugh. I guess what we built with the audience was a confidence-- 

Charlie Rose:That says volumes, doesn't it. 

Jason Alexander:Exactly. There was a confidence that if they tuned it on, whether it was good, bad, stupid, broad, small, whatever it was going to be, they were going to laugh, so-- 

Charlie Rose:Where is it Larry David's vision and where is it Jerry Seinfeld's vision and where is it something else? 

Jason Alexander:It's hard to say. I think it was a unanimous collaboration, as far as the idea of doing a show about the daily life of a comedian, which was essentially very small things. I mean, there were no great events in Jerry Seinfeld's daily life. I think that the cynicism of the show, the darkness of the show, particularly in its first four or five years-- 

Charlie Rose:Let me guess. 

Jason Alexander:--is much more Larry David than Jerry. Jerry has a much lighter heard and a much younger heart, and Larry is-- you know, is full of darkness and little twists and turns. But it was a beautiful collaboration, and I think there was no way that-- 

Charlie Rose:So the dark is Larry and the light is Jerry. 

Jason Alexander:And a lot of the inspiration-- I mean, Larry lived across the hall from Kenny Kramer, so Kramer is an experience in Larry's life. George has certainly become a model of Larry David, in many respects. Elaine was sort of modeled on Carol Leifer (sp? ), who was an ex-girlfriend of Jerry's, and a pal. So you know, it's all kind of there, but I think the stuff that people remember us for, particularly early on, came out of the notebooks of Larry David. I remember when we did the masturbation show. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, we showed a clip of that when Larry David was here. 

Jason Alexander:And I said, ''Larry, this is nuts. This is nuts.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yes. 

Jason Alexander:And he said, ''I was in this contest. This is a real thing.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. ''It may be nuts to you. It was my life.'' 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. And everything that I thought, ''Oh, come on. This is pushing credibility,'' he went, ''It's happened to me. This is-- I wrote this down because this has happened to me.'' So I think a lot of the more specific inspiration week to week in the beginning was-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:What's the darkness of Larry? 

Jason Alexander:Well, Larry is-- Larry walks around with a cloud-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--that basically-- 

Charlie Rose:The world's going to rain on him. 

Jason Alexander:--it will rain on him, and that no one likes him and that, really, it's futile to get through the day-- (excerpt omitted from April 23, 1998, broadcast) --because no good can come of it. And yet he's too filled with fear and phobia to actually kill himself, so he struggles on. 

Charlie Rose:After every episode, he would say, ''This is it''? 

Jason Alexander:''This is it.'' He did the pilot and then went, ''I can't do anymore than this. This is it. I did the show. That's it. I can't-- you want more? Four more?'' You know, we had-- our first season order was for four. (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--he said ''That's it. I have no more.'' 

Jason Alexander:And he-- you know, four staggered him. so when 22 came up, he was just, ''Oh, I can't do it.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. And so finally he left. 

Jason Alexander:Finally he left, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. (end of omitted excerpt) Did the show change when he left? 

Jason Alexander:Uh-huh. 

Charlie Rose:How so? 

Jason Alexander:I think, in some way-- well, a lot of things happened when he left. Again, that sort of darker element that had been established -- now, instead of being written by a staff of guys who were in their 30s and 40s and had a little bit of that -- the staff became a lot younger. The staff became-- the writing staff was in their 20s and they weren't particularly dark people. So instead of-- 

Charlie Rose:They'd known nothing but good times. 

Jason Alexander:--living it and expressing it, they were kind of writing a semblance of it. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:So I think the reality of the experience was one step removed. The other thing is that Jerry really felt his-- he spread his wings. And what Jerry-- Jerry's-- one of Jerry's favorite television shows was the old Abbott and Costello Show. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:And I think we started to go that way, for the most part. I think we started to look less and less at the small minutiae of things. Our intrinsic storylines got broader in their scope, a little wackier, a little more -- in a good sense -- juvenile. And another thing that Larry tried to do often was around the third or fourth season, he started playing with the-- instead of one story and a ''B'' story, he would have four distinct stories, one storyline for each character, that would brilliantly dovetail at the end. The dovetailing seemed to stop for me. One or two would dovetail, but not necessarily all four. All good storylines, but not necessarily with that same polish at the end that makes it go, ''You had to have that in order to get that or to get that or to get that.'' But just as much fun. And even though there were many critics who said, you know, ''It's not the same show,'' you know, the audience, for the most part, seemed to keep saying to-- certainly, to me when I would speak to them, that they were laughing and I-- 

Charlie Rose:So when you heard the criticism over the last year, did you say, ''They've got a point'' or did you say, ''The audience''-- did you say, ''The critics are out of touch with the audience''? 

Jason Alexander:I think the critics had a point, to a certain degree, in that they noticed the change in the show and they were articulating the change in the show. When they went on to say, ''Therefore, it is a''-- (crosstalk) --''a worse show,'' I don't know that I agreed. I can tell you there's not an episode we did, whether I thought it was a great episode or not, where I don't think we had some tremendous, funny moments. And so when people say, ''Favorite episode?'' or ''Favorite season?'' I go, ''You know, I really don't know'' because in every one of them there was something really spectacular. 

Charlie Rose:I don't want to use the word ''art,'' but where did your-- where did George go, from where he began to where he is today, as we approach May 14th? 

Jason Alexander:I think what happened to George, in some ways is-- once we finished with Susan and George had committed the ultimate act of cold-- 

Charlie Rose:Yes. 

Jason Alexander:--which is-- you know, whatever emotional investment he had in this woman, at the announcement of her death, it just seemed to not be there. It was an indication to the writers that you could get pretty cold with George, and I think-- I think some of the sweetness of George got lost towards the end. What was always kind of remarkable was that he could do these really horrible, terrible things -- he was such a schmo -- and yet there was a lovability about him because it was always for a good reason. If he messed up with a girl, it's because he was trying to be all things to this girl. He didn't believe that he could possibly be enough, so he would try and become whatever he thought was expected of him, and be hoisted on his own petard. (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--better than he was, trying to be something-- 

Jason Alexander:Exactly. And towards the end-- 

Charlie Rose:Were you happy with the evolution, then? 

Jason Alexander:Personally, I felt, when Larry left, that George got a little less interesting. I think that, for the most part-- and I still had a great time, and I loved doing it and I think they gave me some great storylines and some great things to play, but the complexity of the character I think got diminished. And that the guys really had a better feel for Kramer and Jerry, and even Elaine, to a large extent, than they did for George. And it was confirmed for me -- although I can't-- obviously, I can't tell you much about it. When Larry came back and wrote the final episode, the finale, I-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--felt a different character again. I felt something that hadn't been there for a while. 

Charlie Rose:Something you liked better. 

Jason Alexander:Something that was more interesting to me. 

Charlie Rose:More interesting. 

Jason Alexander:Yeah, a little more interesting. 

Charlie Rose:''Interesting'' is better. What can you tell me about the final episode? 

Jason Alexander:Not much. It's-- 

Charlie Rose:It's 30 minutes. 

Jason Alexander:It's actually an hour. 

Charlie Rose:I mean an hour, right. 

Jason Alexander:I think it's brilliant in its idea and in its structure. And I can tell you that it brought back a lot of folks that had really been a part of our extended family-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--over the years, so I was-- 

Charlie Rose:But it's brilliant. 

Jason Alexander:--glad to see them. I thought it was wonderful. 

Charlie Rose:Would you-- 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Your post-mortem on it, having lived through it without being able to tell us, is that it's a home run. 

Jason Alexander:I think it's as big a home run as you can have, which is to say no one's going to be satisfied. Larry is absolutely right in his paranoia about this because he worked his guts out, and you can't-- you know, there's such expectations about this thing that no one will feel satisfied. But I think what they did, considering all the options that they had talked about-- and one of the options, by the way, was not doing a finale episode, just doing an episode. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jason Alexander:Considering the scrutiny that it's going through, and the expectations on what had to be achieved, I think it's just a brilliant job and-- 

Charlie Rose:Close to 80 million people are going to watch this, they think? 

Jason Alexander:OK. 

Charlie Rose:What's it going to do-- are you guys going to all say to each other, ''It's been one hell of a ride, I'm off for the rest of the my life, see you later''? 

Jason Alexander:To each other or-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, to each other. 

Jason Alexander:--to the other-- 

Charlie Rose:To each other. 

Jason Alexander:I hope not. You know, we do have kind of different lives. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:And we are four very different people, and it's been an amazing relationship between the four of us. 

Charlie Rose:It's a defining event in one's life. 

Jason Alexander:Yes. We have been through something-- 

Charlie Rose:Because of its huge success. 

Jason Alexander:--something amazing. Jerry-- before we went out to tape the final stuff in front of the audience for the last show-- we always got together backstage behind the apartment set, and we would have a little huddle and just kind of just-- (crosstalk) --connect with each other. And you know, we're-- as reflected on our show, it's not a terrible sentimental group and we never-- 

Charlie Rose:No. 

Jason Alexander:--you know, took the show very seriously, to its credit. But we got into the little huddle and Jerry started to mist up and cry. And it's not that it's, you know, out of character, but it's just unusual. And he said, ''You know, the four of us are inexorably tied to each other. No one from this day on will think of one of us without thinking of the other three.'' And he said, ''I can't think of three people I would rather be linked to for the rest of my life.'' And he's right. I mean, we will be, you know, the Musketeers till the end of our lives. And it was an amazing relationship and I can't think of a working relationship with that much attention that could go for that long that could be that much fun. We-- even under the worst of circumstances, when all the negotiations were happening, and there was a lot of tension and a lot of pressure and it really got hot under the collar for a while, we still laughed every day that we went to work. And I can't imagine not having those people in my life. I think for a little while, we may want to get away from each other to explore other things, but I certainly know that I'll work with Julia again. She and I have worked together outside of the show already and had a wonderful time. I would love to work with Michael in some capacity. Jerry'll be the hardest one because we don't know what Jerry wants to do. You know, we don't know if he's going to continue on as a performer outside of stand-up or if he wants to produce other things or what he wants to do, but-- 

Charlie Rose:What do you think he wants to do? 

Jason Alexander:Well, he's talked about-- I know for a while he wants to take a rest. He has really not had a life for nine years. 

Charlie Rose:I don't understand what that means. I mean, just-- 

Jason Alexander:Well, as actors-- 

Charlie Rose:--because he said it and I know-- 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. As actors, we had a very cushy job. Seinfeld is a show that would shoot for eight months out of the year. But it would shoot two weeks on, one week off, so as actors, we had that one week off. Well, as a writer, you don't have that one week off because the reason for the one week is to catch up with the shows you have to get to. We would finish shooting, he would continue in post-production on the shows that had yet to be aired. So he would finish his job around the middle of May and by the end of June, beginning of July, they had to reassemble to start coming up with shows for the next season. So, he would have no down time and he'd have about six weeks off a year to go have a life. And other than that, it was a seven-day-a-week job for, you know, 42 weeks of the year. So, it was not a glamorous, cushy job for him. It was far cushier for the rest of us. We had lives, but Jerry didn't, so I think he's going to take some time and do some traveling, come back to New York. He wants to move himself back to New York. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, I know. 

Jason Alexander:He is retiring his act in August with an HBO special that he's doing-- 

Charlie Rose:Retiring his act-- his stand-up act? 

Jason Alexander:All the material that he's performed over the year, he's going to do one more time, brush it up, do it one more time on Broadway and then-- 

Charlie Rose:Is that one night or-- 

Jason Alexander:He's going to do it for about two weeks in the theater and then tape it and-- 

Charlie Rose:For HBO and then it'll be on-- 

Jason Alexander:And all the proceeds for that are going to charity, and then he will never do any of that material again. 

Charlie Rose:It forces him to start fresh. 

Jason Alexander:He wants to write a whole new act. And he very much wants to get back to the stand-up arena. He loves that. He's also talked about-- he's really enjoyed his relationship with American Express and creating the spots for them, and he's talked about trying to do a little boutique-y ad agency where, you know, people basically deliver their product to him and he creates-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--how to make-- 

Jason Alexander:--how to do it. 

Charlie Rose:--it sellable. 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:And you? 

Jason Alexander:I've been sort of preparing for this for years. I started a production company three years ago and we've been developing film and television projects. I'm associated now with Universal Television, developing television shows for them and for the people that they're working with. I have, you know, a very nicely burgeoning career as a director. I would eventually love to get back to the stage. It's the thing I would like to do most, but I have two very small children, and 8: 00 o'clock at night is not a good time to be away from the house right now. (excerpt omitted from April 23, 1998, broadcast) 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Is there any down side to this for you? Any? Not the ending of it, the doing of it. 

Jason Alexander:The doing of Seinfeld? 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Does it have any down side? 

Jason Alexander:No. 

Charlie Rose:None? 

Jason Alexander:No. Other than the fact that I'm not the world's most comfortable celebrity. It would not be my choice to really not be able to be anonymous, and I'm-- the four of us are actually intensely private, and I think that's been seen over the years. You don't see us out at the premiers and-- 

Charlie Rose:Right. Right. Right. Right. 

Jason Alexander:--the parties and at the spots. But I have found that people have been really wonderful and kind and respectful to me and my family. You know, I go to the market. I go to the movies. I live my life, but I get all the perks. I get, you know, all the wonderful treatment that comes with-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--knows who you are. 

Jason Alexander:Right. 

Charlie Rose:You're making good money. 

Jason Alexander:Made a wonderful living. My children's lives are secure and (unintelligible) 

Charlie Rose:How tough did it get-- I mean-- (end of omitted excerpt) --the story is-- conventional wisdom is that it was you who said at the beginning, ''We ought to be getting more'' and made the argument for a million dollars an episode, which I guess, if you believe the press, ended up as $600,000 an episode, give or take what might be, whatever it is, whatever the truth is. It's somewhere in between there. Did you begin that? Was that your idea? 

Jason Alexander:I didn't-- 

Charlie Rose:And how tough did it-- 

Jason Alexander:I didn't begin-- 

Charlie Rose:--get for you? 

Jason Alexander:--the million-dollar idea. The million-dollar figure actually first came out of Julia's mouth, but it was not-- it was not a-- 

Charlie Rose:Why not a million, right? 

Jason Alexander:Well, it was not a wild, ''I think we should get a million dollars.'' There had been actual research done. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:We knew that for the network alone, every episode of Seinfeld generated $14 million of profit, of sheer profit, for the network alone, let alone Castle Rock and the syndication participants. We had argued that after five years of being in Seinfeld, there was no up side, in the long run, for the three of us to continue doing the show. It had made us celebrities. It had made us some money. But if we were going to be actors with careers that extended, where we needed to play different roles, continuing to put out the image of George, Elaine and Kramer was actually detrimental to our long-run careers. So, why was there any incentive for us to be in this for the long run unless those shows were extremely profitable to us? So we argued that we needed to be cut in on syndication. We needed syndication points. And we were told in no small terms to go take a hike. When we got into the bargaining chair, and NBC so desperately wanted to have another season or another two seasons, we said again, ''Syndication. Our salaries are fine, but you're making such massive profits in syndication, profits of $3 million to $4 million per show,'' ad in-- you know, in to infinity, ''and you don't want to give us any of that? OK. In order for us to feel good about doing this show, I want to leave 'the most successful half hour in the history of television' knowing that I never have to work again. That is what I require or you can't have my services.'' So, knowing what all the revenues were, what we would have made had they given us the syndication, what everybody was making up front, we said-- we tried to figure out what percentage of the success formula of the show were the three of us and we came up with (starts counting on his fingers) Jerry, Larry, the writers, us, and everything else (ends with five fingers) -- the wonderful guest players, you know, all the other stuff. Well, as one fifth of that formula, we said, ''Here's the number. A million an episode.'' And-- 

Charlie Rose:And when you uttered that number, what did they say? 

Jason Alexander:They did what they should have done, which is laugh at us. And I also knew that it was detrimental to television if they made the deal with us, and it has proven to be detrimental. It is outrageous up-front money, outrageous. It is bad for television. Thirteen million dollars an episode for E.R.? A million dollars each to Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt for a show that's number 25 to 30 in the ratings? These are bad prices. You ask for that kind of money when you are producing the kind of profit revenue that we are producing, but we couldn't ask for it on that side. They wouldn't give it to us, so we had to take it out up front. And I personally feel that we damaged the economics of television and that NBC was foolish to give us what they gave us. But there was no way we were going to come back for anything less than the $600,000. The $600,000 was my bottom line, so I guess I'm guilty of that. I knew that at $600,000 an episode, we would gross a certain amount, I would net a certain amount, and that would pay for the rest of my life. But I thought they were foolish to make the deal. I thought they were foolish in the way they handled us. I thought that it ruined relationships. 

Charlie Rose:It did? 

Jason Alexander:I think so. 

Charlie Rose:Between whom? 

Jason Alexander:I felt that we were part of a real family with 

Nbc:You just said they shouldn't have done it. 

Jason Alexander:Right. But we began in December, and they didn't talk to us -- talk to us, really -- until three weeks before it had to be a deadline. So, we went through the rest of our season with our crew, with our writers, with everyone going, ''Are we coming back? Because our lives depend on this,'' and the three of us going (shrugs broadly), ''We're serious and they're not dealing with us.'' We were the bad guys. These people couldn't make decisions about their lives or know what their lives were going to be because the three of us were playing a game of chicken with NBC because NBC wouldn't talk to us. 

Charlie Rose:Now, where was-- 

Jason Alexander:And they thought if they didn't talk to us until May 1st, that we would crumble, that we would get scared, that we're actors, and we know we may never work again and, you know, if they offered us 250, we would take it because we're going to crumble. And that's not the way you deal with people that are in your family and that have been working with you for nine years. 

Charlie Rose:Where was Jerry in all this? 

Jason Alexander:Between a rock and a hard place. As the producer of the show, it is his mandate to bring the show in as inexpensively as he possibly can. That is his job, to maximize profits as the producer of that show by keeping the costs as low as he can. On the other side of the coin, he'll be the first one to say ''They deserve a million and then some.'' He's our pal. He's our collaborator. He's one of the ensemble. And he believed in us and he believed in our request, I really think. Because he was between a rock and a hard place, he really stayed out of it, and I think we could have had a smoother ride had he not stayed out of it, but he would have had to choose one hat to wear, and I think that's a very, very difficult decision to make. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. What do you make-- 

Jason Alexander:And so I don't-- I don't-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:I don't blame him for staying out of it. And ultimately, he did jump in at the end and say, ''God damn it, finish this'' to the network, and that's the day we closed the deal. 

Charlie Rose:When he said, ''Finish it.'' 

Jason Alexander:He said, ''You guys better stop the shenanigans and give them what they want today or I'm going to pull.'' And so that was the final incentive to at least get it done. 

Charlie Rose:But if he'd done that six months earlier, would it have worked? 

Jason Alexander:I don't know if it would have worked. I think it would have made us a lot happier-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--because we would have felt-- 

Charlie Rose:His pain from-- 

Jason Alexander:--a lot less presence-- 

Charlie Rose:--uncertainty-- 

Jason Alexander:Exactly. But honest to God, I don't-- I don't hold him responsible. I don't blame him. I have no bad feeling about that at all. I really understand-- 

Charlie Rose:Where-- 

Jason Alexander:--the position he was in. 

Charlie Rose:Where is the pain in between people at NBC who you think let you guys down-- 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:--and didn't appreciate-- 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. Yeah. There was a thing that >>NBC tried to do at the end of this season that we just thought: Yeah. In essence, because they're-- when you take clips out of a show and you put them together, you essentially make a new show. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jason Alexander:Well, our contract, there's $600,000 for every half hour of new show. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jason Alexander:And they wanted to not pay us for the clip show. They said, ''You want to''-- 

Charlie Rose:Why am I not surprised by this? 

Jason Alexander:''You're asking us to take $1.2 million out of our pockets?'' 

Charlie Rose:Yes! 

Jason Alexander:I don't think so. And legally, they didn't have the ground to stand on, and they actually put it on the table to us. 

Charlie Rose:But they tried to make it happen. 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. So, at the very end of this, when we're maybe getting over what was last year, you're zetzing us again at the end of this year? 

Charlie Rose:What did they say? 

Jason Alexander:It went away quickly. It went away very quickly. 

Charlie Rose:Here's the amazing thing about it, was the unity and the cohesion-- 

Jason Alexander:When the $600,000 number came up, there was a lot of debate-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--because I didn't want to stop there. 

Charlie Rose:What do you mean, you didn't want to stop there? 

Jason Alexander:I would have held out for the mil. 

Charlie Rose:Ah. 

Jason Alexander:I wanted to keep going. 

Charlie Rose:Oh, I see. So you were going to hold out all the way. 

Jason Alexander:And it was kind of a two against three-- two against one-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--vote on it, two for 600 mil and-- 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. Julia-- 

Charlie Rose:--one for a mil and-- 

Jason Alexander:--was really convinced that we probably wouldn't get further than that. Michael was on the fence and I said, you know, ''I'm willing to play chicken because I'm willing to not do it.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:But I wasn't going to blow it for two other people that were really, you know, maybe a little more nervous about it. But you know, I was willing to go another couple of days despite all the threats. They kept threatening us with Frazier in the wings. ''They're calling Frazier. They're getting your time slot.'' You know, that was happening in the wings. 

Charlie Rose:So what was the worst pressure that they brought to bear on you? 

Jason Alexander:Really nothing other than the wait. 

Charlie Rose:The what? Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:The wait. (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--''not to do this and you're just going to be out in the cold.'' 

Jason Alexander:Right. 

Charlie Rose:That was it. 

Jason Alexander:Right. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:They really made it sound like on May 10th, they were going to announce that Thursdays at 9: 00 o'clock ''Welcome Frazier.'' And I, to my dying day, say that would have been insane. Insane. You don't take $14 million-- they're spending $1 million to make $14 million. We're asking them to spend $4 million to-- 

Charlie Rose:To make $14 million. 

Jason Alexander:--to make $10 million. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Right. Right. 

Jason Alexander:And they're saying ''no''? In what economic environment does that make sense? Eventually, they would have found a way to do it. And by the way, we offered them several ways to do it. We said, ''Pay it against this. Try it against this. Try it against this.'' 

Charlie Rose:But it's more than that. It's also the fact that-- the sort of lead-in, and the audience you deliver for the next half hour. That's a huge factor, too. 

Jason Alexander:Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:You know, it's not just what you do for that half hour, it's what you do for all of Thursday-- 

Jason Alexander:Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:--which is the reason, I assume, that they finally folded. 

Jason Alexander:Exactly. And by the way, you know, just an addendum, I don't think any single one of us to the show-- I'll put it out there that Michael probably has a little more drawing power to a large segment of the audience. I think they could have fired any one single of us and, you know, gotten away with it. It was only because it was the three of us going-- 

Charlie Rose:On the other side of-- and I want to go back to the show. On the other side of it, was there any bitterness on their part? 

Jason Alexander:I don't know. 

Charlie Rose:Were they angry about this or-- 

Jason Alexander:They never expressed it. They-- 

Charlie Rose:They just said, ''It's business. You won. It's business.'' 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. I think they felt that it was business. 

Charlie Rose:Yes. 

Jason Alexander:I really do think that. I don't think-- 

Charlie Rose:I'm sure. 

Jason Alexander:I don't think there was any animosity-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--from their part against us. 

Charlie Rose:They didn't say ''How dare you do this?' ' and you know-- 

Jason Alexander:I don't think so. And I've never felt that. 

Charlie Rose:--''We made you rich and now you want to be richer and''-- 

Jason Alexander:You know, and like I'm doing today, I've said some pretty-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--you know, critical things about them and I-- and they've never been anything less than gracious and kind and lovely. 

Charlie Rose:And want you to create new product for them. 

Jason Alexander:And I think if I said, ''You know, guys, I'd like to do another show on your network,'' I think they would go, ''Please.'' So, no, I think to them it was truly business, but-- but it wasn't to us. It wasn't. 

Charlie Rose:Jerry made the decision to stop. 

Jason Alexander:Not really. We would talk about it every year for the last three years. Yeah, three years. We would get together right after we finished the first 13. There would be a holiday break-- Christmas, New Year's. And before the break, we would sit down and go ''What do you think?'' because it was always our goal to get to the pinnacle and just maybe going over and go out-- 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jason Alexander:--to not overstay the welcome. And we kept trying to judge, ''Is this that moment? Is there more to do here?'' And we would do it every year. Now, Jerry did come into this season -- but, frankly, as did the three of us -- thinking ''This is probably going to be that season.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:But just like always, when we sat down at the meeting, he said-- instead of starting by saying, ''What do you think?'' he started by saying, ''I think we're done. What do you think?'' And we really said, ''Yeah, I think so.'' 

Charlie Rose:Because you'd reached the point where it was leveling off, you thought? 

Jason Alexander:Not in the audience. 

Charlie Rose:No, no, no. 

Jason Alexander:No, not in terms-- (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:--you're ahead in terms of what you were putting on the screen. 

Jason Alexander:I felt that we were in danger, if we did another series, of having the characters become caricatures of themselves, that we had become such icons with these characters that we couldn't do anything else that was surprising. Funny, yes. We could turn out funny indefinitely. But to surprise the audience-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--with what these characters might do? We couldn't turn them anywhere. So, I think that becomes the place where you go. If you're not in it just for the money, get out. (excerpt omitted from April 23, 1998, broadcast) 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. It's amazing that you did it as long as you did. John Cleese will say that they had no more Fawlty Towers in them. It wasn't that they wouldn't like to continue. 

Jason Alexander:Sure. 

Charlie Rose:They had exhausted what they thought was the creative-- 

Jason Alexander:Juice, right. 

Charlie Rose:That if they did it anymore, it would be less good. 

Jason Alexander:Right. 

Charlie Rose:And they couldn't bear to make it less good. 

Jason Alexander:These guys were confident that they were never going to run out of jokes. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jason Alexander:And they didn't. 

Charlie Rose:But it's not just jokes, as you say. It's something more. 

Jason Alexander:They weren't going to run out of things to highlight. They weren't going to run out of little-- 

Charlie Rose:The writers? 

Jason Alexander:Yeah-- little-- 

Charlie Rose:So what would-- they weren't going to run out of anything, then, huh? They could have done it forever. They were like a perpetual motion machine. 

Jason Alexander:Absolutely. I think the writers would have gone on for quite a while. (end of omitted excerpt) 

Charlie Rose:Was there anything to be gained by going another year? 

Jason Alexander:In the big picture? 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:I don't think so. 

Charlie Rose:There's nothing? 

Jason Alexander:No. I think what is happening has proven how perfect the timing was. I can't imagine it going any better. 

Charlie Rose:I don't think so, no. 

Jason Alexander:You know, there seems to-- if your goal is ''Leave 'em wanting more,'' we hit the hammer-- we hit the nail right on the head. 

Charlie Rose:You have had to have thought about this and-- I know you have. It may very well be that this is-- Seinfeld is as good as it's ever going to get for you. 

Jason Alexander:Uh-huh. 

Charlie Rose:And you have to come to this idea, that '' 

Ok:Uh-huh. 

Charlie Rose:Right? 

Jason Alexander:Absolutely. I had a fascinating conversation with William Shatner a couple of years ago, who is an idol of mine, by the way. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:And he-- we were talking about exactly that, about how after Star Trek, the series, ended, he was very bitter that, as a man in his early 30s, it seemed like the thing that was going to have the greatest impact on people in his career was done. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Jason Alexander:And he was bitter about it and he tried to distance himself from it. And his career suffered for it, and his reputation suffered a little bit for it until, finally, it wasn't until 20 years later that he went, ''I have had an opportunity to create something that will live so far beyond me. How many actors have that? How many actors have that moment, even for a moment, regardless of when it comes?'' And he really embraced it. And he said, you know, ''You might want to think about embracing that and not letting yourself''-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Embracing it rather than making it your enemy. 

Jason Alexander:I have no illusions that anything that I'm involved with from this day on will have the impact or the mass acceptance or the profitability or whatever, the upside, of a Seinfeld. What Seinfeld has given me is the ability to now do the things that move me, that I care about, even if they're just silly, funny things. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:Seinfeld is not-- it's not my sense of humor necessarily. My sense of humor actually has more hugging and growing. I think humor is one of the great teachers. Now, Seinfeld did teach, but in a sort of abstract, bizarre way. It now gives me the ability to go, ''I don't care if it's successful to that degree, and I don't care if they can't afford to pay me.'' That's not a factor for me anymore. What I care about now is do I want my name attached to it and do I care about it. 

Charlie Rose:And the answer-- (crosstalk) 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. That was the greatest gift that Jerry could give me. 

Charlie Rose:Roll tape. One more clip. Here it is-- Seinfeld. 

Jason Alexander:Well, it was a hell of a yada, yada. 

Actress:He's moving to Seattle. He wanted to say good-bye? I was just getting out of the shower and yada, yada, yada. 

Jason Alexander:All right. Enough. Enough. From now on, no more yada, yadas. Just give me the full story. 

Actress:OK. Well, when I got out of the shower, I was dripping wet. 

Jason Alexander:Not that story. Another story. Tell me about the free facial. 

Actress:OK. Well, like I said, I was on 3rd Avenue and I stopped by a large department store. 

Jason Alexander:Which one? 

Actress:Bloomingdale's. 

Jason Alexander:Very good. Go on. 

Actress:And I stole a Piaget watch. 

Jason Alexander:What's that? 

Actress:And then I was on such a high that I went upstairs to the salon on the 5th floor and got a massage and a facial and skipped out on the bill. 

Jason Alexander:Shoplifting? 

Actress:Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? 

Charlie Rose:For those who haven't seen the show, but who clearly watch it because May 14th becomes a cultural event, who is your character? Who is George? 

Jason Alexander:Oh, golly. He's the product of Jerry Stiller and Estelle Harris and that continual berating and insanity. At heart, you know, a guy who wants it all and has no tools with which to achieve it. But his saving grace is that he's aware of it and can laugh about it, despite the fact that it frustrates and angers him to no end. And the end result of that is he kind of says and does all the unthinkable things that one might do in that situation. He gives free vent to it. 

Charlie Rose:And who is Jerry? 

Jason Alexander:Jerry, by the end of our show, by the end of this nine-year run, is his best friend. Jerry began as the moderate observer and became the guy who reveled in everyone's misery just as much as George and Elaine and-- eventually did. In fact, he was an instigator more often than not, or a catalyst, who-- of that misery. (excerpt omitted from April 23, 1998, broadcast) 

Charlie Rose:Ed McMahon was here the other day and we just were talking about the end of Carson and other things. And he was saying there was-- for both Carson and him, for a while thereafter, the old instincts were still there. They'd get up and read the paper and they'd think about -- especially Johnny -- call him up and said just, ''Wouldn't this be great?'' There was still-- you know, the rhythms of doing the show-- 

Jason Alexander:Right. 

Charlie Rose:--you know, were there, as part of their internal psyche. That'll be there for you, too, for a bit. 

Jason Alexander:I think so. I can assure you that 20 years from now, if the four of us put on the glasses and the frizzy hair and-- that we could do it exactly as well. They-- it was like putting on comfortable shoes every day. Too easy. And I know that not Elaine and Kramer and Jerry, but Julia and Michael and Jerry, their senses of humor, their sensibilities have infused into me and I actually come away far funnier a person and far funnier an actor than I began with nine years ago. 

Charlie Rose:Were you a funny actor nine years ago? 

Jason Alexander:I understood comedy and I had a flair for it. If someone was a funny writer and the material was funny-- 

Charlie Rose:You could deliver it. 

Jason Alexander:--I could bring it through. I was not a guy that should go in and host the Emmys, which I did, and then do on the Emmys, on live television, two improvisational segments, where there was no script, and think it would be funny. That would have been a living nightmare. By the time I did do that, I said, ''I think I can pull this off'' because of what I had been exposed to, from watching Jerry, the master at working an audience and playing with an audience and watching Michael's ability to do a take, make a sound, watching Julia's ability to play something very serious and make it funny. Her funniest moments are when she is about to cry from, you know, the horror of her life and it is heart-breakingly funny. (end of omitted excerpt) 

Charlie Rose:Where can you imagine Jerry being in a couple years, three years, four years? I mean-- 

Jason Alexander:I don't-- 

Charlie Rose:--he's going to have some kind of place-- 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:--in American entertainment. 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. I don't know. I think that-- in some ways, I think he'd like to step backward. I don't think he necessarily wants to be the celebrity that he's been. I think he merely wants to go back to saying what he wants to say when he wants to say it. He obviously isn't going to care about the money. I think his life is very simple, very simple, and I think that with the absence of the show and with its potentially diminishing return of excitement and enthusiasm by the audience, because it's not new energy, it's repetition-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:--that he will go back to being quieter, privater, simpler and you'll see him when he wants you to see him. 

Charlie Rose:And maybe married. 

Jason Alexander:I don't know. 

Charlie Rose:The best thing that you were most proud of before you came to Seinfeld was what? Was it the Jerome Robbins thing or was it something else? 

Jason Alexander:I was very proud of Jerome Robbins, although not as an actor. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:I was very proud of the people that I had been associated with in the creation of that experience. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:I think the proudest thing for me prior to Seinfeld was probably a toss-up between Broadway Bound, because it was the first time that I was allowed to be a professional actor and not sing, and possibly Pretty Woman because it was the first thing-- 

Charlie Rose:You played the lawyer. 

Jason Alexander:I was the bad guy, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:It's great to have you here and it's great to meet you. 

Jason Alexander:Thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:It's an extraordinary thing you guys have been involved in. 

Jason Alexander:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:And May 14th, America will be watching, and you think they'll like it. 

Jason Alexander:I'm pretty sure. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Jason Alexander:I'm pretty sure. 

Charlie Rose:Thank you. 

Jason Alexander:Thank you. 

Charlie Rose:JASON ALEXANDER, the final Seinfeld, May 14th, 1998. Thank you for joining us.
