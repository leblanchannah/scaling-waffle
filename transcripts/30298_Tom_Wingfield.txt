"The Glass Menagerie" is one of Tennessee Williams' most beloved plays, the semi-autobiographical play has been staged on Broadway eight times since its premier in 1945. The current production from Director Sam Gold is now running at the Belasco Theater. Here is a look. 

Do you think that I'm crazy about the warehouse? Do you think that I'm in love with the Continental Shoemakers? Do you think I want to spend 55 years down there in that celotex interior of florescent tubes? I mean, honest to God, I would rather that somebody picked up a crowbar and battered out my brains than go back mornings. But I go, every time, and you come in yelling that goddamn, rise and shine, rise and shine! I say to myself, how lucky dead people are. (LAUGHTER) But I get up and I go. For $65 a month, I give up all that I dream of doing and being ever! And then you say, self -- self is all that I think of. Listen, mother, if self is what I thought of, I would be where he is, gone. 

Joining me now are the four stars of the play. (LAUGHTER) Sally Field, Joe Mantello, Madison Ferris, and Finn Wittrock. I'm pleased to have all of them here at this table. Let me just start this. This is the way you were. (LAUGHTER) You didn't want to see, you didn't want to hear. 

It's so good. 

Brilliant performances. 

Well, thank you. But we have to go back tomorrow night and do them and all we will be able to think of is seeing ourselves on the monitor. 

Why is this such a great play? 

Boy, why is it such -- first of all, people would say the language of it is so -- 

A great playwright produced it. 

Yes. (LAUGHTER) The language of it is so beautiful and poetic. But I think it's because it is ultimately really about things that always stay relevant, whatever era you're looking at it in. And that it's about family and love and the complication of that, of trying to be -- trying to grow up and away from your family. And live through a complicated time and a complicated family. And that it is autobiographical and that Tennessee really never did quite survive. I mean, he was a great artist but the ramifications of leaving his sister stayed with him all of his life. And tortured him. 

How long have you wanted to play Amanda? 

Well, all of my life. Certainly it is one of the great roles for a woman. Hamlet, for -- especially for an older woman. So, always. And every woman wants to play Amanda. It is as complex as you possibly can imagine. Or can possibly make it. And we make it very complicated. It is a great role, a wonderful role. 

You, in part, wanted to play it because you wanted to watch Sam direct. 

Yes, yes. That is actually the primary reason, yes. You know, I think Mike Nichols said the thing about directing is it's like sex -- you never get to see anyone else do it so you don't know how good you are, and so I -- 

Only Mike Nichols would say that. 

Yes. (LAUGHTER) And so I wanted to be in a room with Sam. And, you know, and I said to him early on, your metabolism as a director is so radically different than mine. And I want to know what you know. And it's been an extraordinary experience from that part alone. 

What's the relationship between Laura and Tom? 

Well, my playing Tom, is an older man looking back on his time with his sister and his mother. And it really is, the thing about this production is Sam has really embraced the memory play aspect of it, obviously, with someone of my age -- 

What does that mean? 

Well -- 

They call this a memory play. 

I think it means different things in different productions. At 54 years old, my looking back at a story that happened when I was 21 or 22 has a different set of stakes. You know, at 54, to still be rehashing this story, remembering this story, being haunted by this story, is different than a 31-year-old man looking back on, you know, nine years earlier, whatever. So it is about how memory is refracted. What are the things that are remembered accurately, inaccurately? What are the things that get expanded? We talked about all of that as we worked on it. 

A bare set, nothing. 

Yes. 

Nowhere to hide. 

That makes it easier or harder for actors? (LAUGHTER) 

It's very exposing. You feel very naked up there, I think. There is nothing to hide behind literally. Nothing to lean on except for each other. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

At first, it's complicated because you don't have anything. And then once you figure out the version of the play, then actually there is something liberating about it. 

I think it's difficult on so many levels. I mean, I guess, certainly the space as we live in it gets smaller and we own it in a certain way. But it is so enormous, the real stage, it is higher than you can see and there's nothing to let the sound bounce off of. So we're really trying to fill this, or at least I am, this really huge space. 

Cavernous place. 

Cavernous space. And that, for me, I think that's -- I'm aware of that and the kind of energy that it takes to do that. 

Tell me about Laura. 

Laura is, in this production, trying to keep her mother and her brother together. And she is, she's very sweet. I don't think she's very extroverted. I think she likes to be by herself and she is an artist. She likes movies. She likes going to the zoo. She likes plants. And for some reason that is weird. 

To the family. 

Yes. 

Let's get this straight. 

She's just drifting along. 

Her mother doesn't get that. 

This is a play though you can go and see on videotape. You can go see how many performances have been done. There was a revival three years ago. 

Yes. 

Do you do that? Do you want to see how other people have interpreted the characters? 

I don't. 

Me neither. 

No. 

I don't even want to see how I've interpreted it. (LAUGHTER) 

Actually, is Amanda the same now as you imagined her before you took the role on? 

Not at all. And I don't think I really imagined her. I actually played Amanda once before at the Kennedy Center however many years ago it was now, 10, 12 years ago, in a very straightforward production, in a very, you know, sort of pastely way that it is usually shown. 

Pastely. 

Yes, pastely kind of look, you know, kind of soft, memory-like thing in a very linear fashion. And this is like a whole other play, so it is like a whole other character even though I have played it before. 

What do you think you know about her now? 

What do I think I know about her now? I wonder if I have really come to any conclusions about her. I hope I haven't really come to any conclusions, I -- 

Because it's inspiration every night? 

I think so, I hope so. I mean, I'm trying to do that. I think that is the task now since this run is going to be a fairly long one. So I, every night, I know there are certain ingredients that she has, this fierceness about her that, you know, she gets, she's so deeply frightened of destruction because she has no choices as a woman in this era that she's kind of in, that it comes out in a fiercer attitude than I had ever imagined. But again, I think every night I discover certain aspects of how much she feels about things and how much of an illusion she lives in, and yet accuses him of it. 

Does everybody suffer the father's abandonment? 

Well, I know Amanda does. 

Of course she does. 

Yes, I don't know about whether they do or not. Even as Amanda, I haven't bothered to ask. 

Imagine Laura was six when the father left, so I think she has memories of being with him and possibly the night he left. And they're not all negative memories, so -- 

Sometimes there's guilt, like in divorces, there's guilt. 

Yes, the children blame themselves. 

Why did daddy leave us, it must have been me. 

Right. And then to have a younger brother to sort of look out for who maybe has one or two memories with him at four. 

What does the gentleman caller bring to this play? 

It's funny we were just talking about the father because -- (LAUGHTER) What I was going to say about that is he is almost -- gentleman caller is kind of filling a void I think that is -- that was left by the father. He's totally a different person and is incapable of doing that, but all these people kind of need something from him. He says at the very beginning, Tom says at the very beginning, he is the long -- 

The long delayed but always expected, something that we live for. 

Yes, so he is -- 

Long delayed but always expected, something that we live for. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

In some way, I think Jim senses that, maybe even unconsciously that he means something very strongly to all of these people in a kind of idealistic way. 

He comes with optimism, doesn't he? 

Totally. I think he is -- he believes in the American dream, in the sort of old-fashioned sense of that, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps. If you believe in it, you can make it happen. And life isn't quite giving back to him in a way that he expected that it would. He was a star in high school. He was like the main guy on campus, you know. And since graduation, things haven't, he has fallen off that pedestal. And so then he comes back to Laura who still remembers him in that way, remembers the heroic side of him. And it reminds him of that old glory. 

Reminds him of his best years. 

Yes. But also, then I think the two of them in their scene have an unusual -- it doesn't go the way that he expects it to, you know, I think he falls as enamored with her, in love with her, as she with him. 

Is that how he gets her to open up? 

Well, I think so. 

Laura? 

Yes. 

No, not Laura. (LAUGHTER) 

Yes, I think it starts off by Laura thinking she's going on a date with some Joe Schmo and then she realizes it's the guy, the man. And it's intimidating, it's scary, so much so that she shakes, but she rallies and she -- I think it's a familiar story of meeting someone that was the "it man" on campus and six years later, they're much more humble. And that really allows her to -- 

The world outside has humbled him. 

Yes, exactly. So it allows her to blossom in front of him. Yes, and they -- 

It is, in fact, that he is no longer the big man on campus, but he has been chastised or somehow has been leveled by the outside world. 

Life's got him down. 

But it makes her even identify with him a bit. 

Right. I think they've always had a little bit of a connection but this is where we really get to test those waters. And they do, I think they really click. And I think they even fall in love however briefly. 

Yes. Is this what Tennessee Williams had, family, an understanding? I mean, Faulkner wrote about family, and other people in different venues. 

Yes, I think -- I mean, he was haunted by this story and about what happened at this time in his life. He wrote about it many, many times. He wrote short stories. He wrote screenplays. There are lots of different -- as we did research at the beginning, there was a lot of material that involved these characters. And so on some level, he was consumed by those early days with his mother and with his sister. And, you know, and then I think -- and then I think those characters became -- blossomed and became Blanche DuBois or different aspects. 

We went through all of his writing, really all these characters. 

All these characters. 

Yes. 

You can find them in other. 

Yes, you can find in other, yes, little pieces of them, certainly Amanda is in "Street Car." 

Yes. 

No doubt in Blanche and in others of his characters. 

What have you learned by watching the direction of this? What you came to do. 

Yes, I did. I mean, what I think -- what I admire so much about it, it's a really, really bold and modern take on the play. It's very unorthodox. And probably unlike any production of "The Glass Menagerie" that you will see. But I think what I learned was that Sam took Tennessee Williams' charge very, very seriously, which was he said, we must get beyond naturalism. We must get beyond the refrigerator and the sofa and that you can get closer to the truth through abstraction. And so to watch Sam struggle with, what does that mean in 2017 as opposed to what did it mean in 1945, we took that charge, as a group, very, very seriously. And these choices that were made were not cavalier, they were not meant to, you know, disrespect. 

You said we took it as a group, meaning... how do you mean that? 

Meaning that we took Sam's idea of how we were going to tell it and we thought well, yes, what does this mean with this particular group of people? 

And it wasn't always easy. It is very hard -- I mean, it's hard to understand how you perform what his concept was in a lot of ways. And I think I was the one that went what? (LAUGHTER) How do you do that? I don't understand. And maybe that was a good thing because Sam would have to really think about how does he explain that to me. You know, in my training, the kind of actor that I am, coming from the Actor's Studio, I would go, how do I play that? I'm not really sure what that means. I do know that having done this now, 50 performances or 51 performances, that you can feel the audience when we come in. They don't know what to make of it. I mean, it's so unorthodox. And you do feel the audience go... And they sit forward, they think -- 

Like, "what's happening?" 

Exactly. And they think they're going to see "Glass Menagerie," oh, we know it's going to do the thing and the thing, okay, so, when is it over? We've seen this, it will be lovely. We'll be delighted by it. All of a sudden, they go, and you can feel the room shift. And at first, we -- you felt them annoyed. I mean, they are kind of annoyed, you know, wait a minute. 

I have to work for this? 

Really! And there's nothing to look at and it's not pretty. I mean, there is nothing pretty about it, it's just stark. Not really -- and the lights are on, and we're not in costume, we're like in costume, we're saying things that don't apply to what is really happening. (LAUGHTER) And then all of a sudden because we made them, or Sam made them sit up and either be annoyed or be something they weren't expecting to feel, then we slowly weave around into the play without them even knowing we're quite in it, without us even knowing we're quite in it, until slowly the lights are lowering and all of a sudden, we are kind of in a costume that we weren't in before. And then, then it's in. We don't have an intermission. We don't have scene breaks. All the scenes are woven together like a memory. So you can't tell when one scene is over and the next is beginning. 

People tell me that they have been trying to get you to come to Broadway. (LAUGHTER) And you've said no, no, no. 

Well, I just couldn't find the right thing. (LAUGHTER) 

But I mean, I would think that just not that many roles like this. 

No. 

That really offered you the kind of bite you wanted to take. 

No, and I have always -- you know, I've looked and looked and looked and read, you know, done readings of new plays and other plays and Scott Rudin, bless his heart, we'd have lunch and he'd say, well, what would it be? I kept saying gosh, I wish I could do "Glass," but I know that's been done and nobody wants to do it. It was when Sam had done "Glass Menagerie" in Amsterdam. And he had done it in Amsterdam, when the great Van Hove had come here to do "A View From a Bridge." And he had gone there to take over for him. He did "Glass Menagerie" in a whole other language. They did not speak English, in Dutch. And then Sam realized he had never really explored the play. And the play was not really what he had thought it was. And then he called Scott and said, I really want to do it on Broadway. And Sam said, guess what, Sally? (LAUGHTER) 

What do we know from what Tennessee wanted this play to be? Any sense of what he said or wrote about "The Glass Menagerie"? How he perceived it? How he -- 

We're working from the published version that he wanted, and what he originally envisioned, which would almost be cliche and quaint now, were, it was a very abstract production with projections, with things that were very, very groundbreaking in 1945. It was not done that way. It was done in a sort of a very -- 

Mostly because the actors couldn't figure it out. (LAUGHTER) Like me and Sam, what? (LAUGHTER) 

But he wanted something. I mean, in 1945 to have, one of the characters to come out and say, hi, this is me. I am the narrator. You are going to see my sister. You are going to see my mother. You know, I think it must have been startling in some way. And again, that's what I think -- I think that's what we were trying to capture, that feeling of what it must have been like to see this extraordinary voice burst on to the scene as a young man. And I mean, I think the greatest compliment that has been paid the production is when people come back and say, I heard things in the play that I have never heard before. And we haven't changed a word. And but isn't that the sign of an extraordinary, like a masterpiece that, you know, it's like a standard. Ella Fitzgerald can do it and you hear this. And Frank Sinatra can do it and you hear this. And they're sturdy and they take interpretation. 

They invite interpretation. 

They invite interpretation. 

So looking at the gentleman caller, what did you look to? 

There is a great book called How to Win Friends and Influence People. 

By Dale Carnegie. 

Yes, which I actually read a bit of every night before I go on. 

Very popular. 

And it actually is great. I mean, the way it is written is very much the way Jim speaks. 

"How To Win Friends and Influence People," something like that? 

Yes, exactly. "How To Win friends and Influence People," yes. And that kind of -- 

That kind of optimism. 

Optimism, American vitality, you know, but actually that book is all about listening to people and engaging them and making them, making what you want from them sound like the thing that they want. Like to make it all about how to make someone else want the thing. 

That is called manipulation. 

Yes, I see your trick. 

Carnegie was a bit about -- 

Yes, did it in kind of a very smart seemingly genuine way, you know. 

Yes. 

As he says, hold your own on any social level, you know. And I think his extrovertism, does that work? Like, is a big contrast to what he walks into in this house especially. Although he and Amanda are sort of on a similar wavelength. But I also think that there was -- I read that there was a certain man that Tennessee -- 

Had in mind. 

-- had in mind in his youth. 

Somebody who was -- 

That he had a crush on. 

I think the character was named after one of his fraternity brothers. 

Right, yeah, from college. 

Who was, in fact, the one that -- 

I think he is named after this young man. 

Who he had a friendship with, but probably from Tennessee's end, it was more than that, but this guy was just a very outgoing, gentle guy who didn't really judge him like other people did. But he also is full of his own self-delusion and self-hypnosis that kind of stops him from -- 

Finding a play like this with all the success it has, does it make you want to spend a lot of time in theater? 

Oh, yes. (LAUGHTER) Right. Me, yes. Oh, totally. I mean, this is, I would've been happy doing this play in my basement, like, this is just -- yes, I mean with this cast, with this crew, with -- 

This direction. 

With this direction, yes, I would have been happy to do it anywhere. 

You said it will be on for a long time. 

Yes. (LAUGHTER) Not that I'm not glad. (LAUGHTER) But it is -- it's a mountain of every night. It's a mountain to climb, a real mountain. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you so much. 

"The Glass Menagerie" at the Belasco Theater. Thank you for joining us, see you next time.
