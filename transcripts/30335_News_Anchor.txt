We begin this evening with the bombing today in St. Petersburg, Russia, at least 11 people were killed after a bomb exploded on a subway. A separate shrapnel-filled explosive device was later found and disarmed at another subway station. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Russian president Vladimir Putin was in St. Petersburg for the day and said that terrorism is being considered as a possible cause. For more on that developing story, we turn to coverage on the CBS Evening News. 

The blast was strong enough to blow out the subway doors. Some passengers pulled others off the train, but some died on the spot. Amateur video shows the chaos and shock underground as dazed commuters tried to figure out what had happened. The explosion took place between stations, but the train carried on through the tunnel to the next stop where the wounded poured up and out onto the streets. Investigators say they found a second bomb at another station which they diffused. It was hidden under a fire extinguisher and they say had it gone off, the blast would have been even more powerful than the first. President Vladimir Putin speaking in his hometown of St. Petersburg today said investigators would pursue all leads. Islamic extremists from the north caucuses have attacked Russian public transport before. Their most recent subway attack was in 2010, when two suicide bombers killed at least 40 people in the Moscow Metro. But since then, Russia has joined in Syria's messy civil war and that may have put it squarely in the crosshairs of ISIS.
