We begin this evening with Syria. Last night, President Donald Trump announced that the United States had carried out a missile strike in Syria. The move follows President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons attack on Tuesday which targeted civilians. 

Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council. 

It is the first direct American assault against the Assad regime. The move is a reversal from Trump's earlier anti-interventionist position. President Vladimir Putin of Russia called it a significant blow to the Russian-American relationship. Tom Friedman wrote about the challenges Trump faces in Syria in his "New York Times" column earlier this week. He joins me now. He is also the author of "Thank You for Being Late." It is, I might suggest, a "New York Times" best-seller and has been there for 16 weeks. So, this president in the midst of a lot of foreign policy this week, meeting with a lot of people, including a crucial meeting, on Thursday night, orders an airstrike against an air force base. What do you see as the repercussions of this? 

Well, I sort of think about this, Charlie, in three buckets. The first is that I think it was important for the United States to use its power to send a signal that people who use poison gas, as we were talking about the 100th anniversary of World War I, that that is just not on. It doesn't mean we can right every wrong, that we can reverse every atrocity but when we have a chance to do this at a cost that's tolerable with a message that's loud, I think it's really important. Because you do not want to have a world where people start thinking that's okay. Secondly, I think it is useful for the United States at a time when we're being tested by North Korea in probably a much more dangerous situation now with nuclear weapons that could be possibly delivered to the United States, to at least interject, Charlie, some uncertainty about American power that don't count on us just to sit back and let you do this. I think that's a healthy by-product of this. The big question, Charlie, is a third bucket which is that the weakness that President Obama faced in dealing with Syria is that you had John Kerry always trying to negotiate a solution, God bless him for that, but we really had no leverage. 

Right. 

And the question is by doing this, does it give us marginally more leverage? Does it say to Putin and others, you know, we're not just going to sit back entirely. We're not diving in, that's clear. There is no desire on the American public to do that. But does it get their attention more? Because it relates for me, Charlie, to a fourth bucket which is that I believe all important politics in the Middle East always happens the morning after the morning after. So the morning after Putin denounces us, U.S. relations are gonna suffer from this, we stand with our Syrian brothers, but I'm betting the morning after the morning after, Putin is on the phone with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and saying, what exactly were you thinking? Poison gas! A day after the American Secretary of State and the American U.N. ambassador basically say, Syria is for the Syrians to decide. 

Right. 

I mean, they were basically in the process of turning it over to you and you now do this? What are you thinking? And the reason that becomes important is that some point down the road, the morning after the morning after the morning after, does Putin say this guy is just too much trouble. And I'm ready to ease him aside, can we then broker some kind of deal with the great powers or whatever, a power-sharing agreement, I don't know, that would be the best-case scenario. 

Doesn't seem like he's doing that, but as you say, it's not the day after the day after. 

Exactly. 

Couple of things about that. Number one, is that you -- some are suggesting -- some -- that perhaps this attack was a consequence of what the Secretary of State said. "We're going to let them do whatever they want to do. We're not going after Assad," I mean, is how they read it. 

Yes, I mean -- 

Then he goes and makes a very dramatic step knowing, I assume, that there are pictures. 

Yes, absolutely. And in the age of Twitter and cell phones, it's gonna get out. 

What they didn't know was what this president's response might be. 

Right. And that because this is a president who we all know, he watches T.V., that's what his -- what's the main stimulus. And he saw those pictures from television. I don't know what the policy was the day before yesterday, what Tillerson and the U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, were talking about in the sense that it's up to the Syrians to decide. I don't think the policy has radically changed. On Syria, Charlie, I have nothing but humility, I think it's the problem from hell. And I think it's one of many problems today that if anybody comes to you and says, Charlie, I'd like you to be Secretary of State, tell them you had your heart set on agriculture. (LAUGHTER) Because it's just the worst job in the world right now. Because there are so many problems like this. And it's like every problem today is Obamacare. You know, it's big, it's complicated, much more difficult to solve than you think. Your own constituency isn't happy in what you do and it always gonna costs more than the American public wants to pay. 

And you know what happens, it seems one more time, that the president has to link his action with a failure to act by the predecessor. 

Well, you know, there is a lot of controversy around Obama's decision, Charlie, to draw a red line and not bomb Syria when it crossed the red line by using poison gas the first time. But I would say this for President Obama, he didn't bomb Syria but used the leverage of the threat of bombing Syria to get a deal for Syria to surrender supposedly all of its poison gas under the supervision of the Russians. And now we know two things. One is that they didn't surrender all their poison gas and that should be an embarrassment to the Russians who guaranteed this deal. But I will say one thing. Had we not done that deal, the poison gas that Syria had, some of it would now be in the hands of ISIS. Because it was being stored in places that ISIS now controls. 

Yes. 

So that wasn't a total zero, what Obama did. I think it is important to remember that we did get a lot of this junk out of the country. But, again, I just think that the problem here is, when a country breaks apart, a country that's been held together basically from the top-down by an iron fist, and it breaks apart, putting it back together again is well nigh impossible, for an outside power or an inside power. So everything you're looking at is, how do we limit the damage? There is one thing I would urge people to consider because I think there are two issues here from an American strategic point of view. There's the humanitarian question and it's horrific what's been going on. We are huge donors of humanitarian aid to Syria, people don't realize how much is pouring in there from the United States. 

We donate more aid than we take in refugees. 

Exactly. But there is also the spillover of people into stable, decent states like Jordan and Lebanon, which is now destabilizing those states which we have a strategic interest in not happening. 

Refugees contribute to the rise of populism in western Europe. 

Exactly. That basically what Putin did with Syria is he weaponized the refugees and by flooding them into Europe as he did, he's triggered a nationalist populist backlash in the European Union which is now straining and stressing the E.U. And I know most Americans don't like to really think about the European Union. Like we used to say about Latin America, they will do anything for the E.U. except read about it, you know. And it seems like a big boring thing. But, you know, I once wrote about the E.U. and I called it Trump's European Union just to fool the search engine. (LAUGHTER) But the fact is the E.U. is the other United States of the world. It's the United Stats of Europe. It's the other great center of liberal ideas, of democracy, of free markets, and free people. It's the other United States, and two United States -- 

And as a whole, it's big. 

It's big. It's the world's biggest market. And two United States, Charlie, are better than one. They're kind of our wing man in the world, you know. You go anywhere in the world -- in Africa, you will see an E.U. aid mission there. Go to the West Bank, who is actually supporting a lot of the Palestinian social services. It's the E.U. The E.U. fragments under the stress of refugees -- not just from Syria, by the way, but also, from sub-southern Africa. That is a huge strategic loss for the United States. So there are a lot of dimensions. 

Suppose I said this to you -- I mean, some argue the following, that this kind of proportionate attack, you'll never change the behavior of Bashar al-Assad. 

Yes. 

The only thing that will change because he can lose an air base tomorrow. 

Yes. 

The only thing that will change him is the fear of survival, the loss of power. 

Right. 

So unless you do something that threatens that, you're not going to get anybody's attention. 

It's true, and I think, you know, my friend, Michael Mandelbaum said the other day, the only thing standing in the way of an American intervention in Syria is American democracy. Because the American people don't want to do it. And so that is a fact. Now, I don't think anyone in their right mind, you know, says, you know, we should want to -- we want to invade Syria and a take it over the way we did Iraq. No one's talking about that. I think the question is, could you partner with the Arab League, with NATO, where they put troops on the ground where we contribute to it, to create some kind of safe zone? Just a small, you know, beachhead or whatever, that might create the pressure not to topple Assad. That's not going to happen. You're right about that, Charlie. But to get the Russians and the Iranians to negotiate seriously. Because what we don't want to do, we actually don't want to topple Assad. We don't want to collapse the state because then you end up with like Iraq where the whole system just falls apart. What you want is the Russians and Iranians to move Assad aside because as long as he's there -- he has killed so many people -- no peace arrangement is possible. Put in some other, you know, general or leader who's not got all this blood on their hands, and then see can you negotiate some kind of power sharing arrangement, devolution of power, the Sunnis have their area, like we're talking about Iraq. It's hellishly hard. I'm not in any way -- 

But when I hear you say that, that's exactly what John Kerry -- 

Yes, was trying to do. 

-- trying to do for years. 

The problem is he had no leverage. 

And he said that, and -- 

Yes and -- 

51 diplomats in the State Department said that. 

Exactly. And that's what they complained to Obama about. 

Right. 

And Obama simply said, I -- Obama took the view that it was either, essentially, all or nothing, that once you started with something, you would end up with a big footprint on the ground. And again, I want to be totally humble about it. It's the problem from hell. I sympathize with anyone who has to deal with it. But I do think that what we are going to have to think about and what Trump will have to think about is, is there a way to build an international coalition? We are not going to do this on our own. That creates some kind of leverage there. It's a "no fly" zone or a safe zone where the Russians finally say, you know what, this is more trouble than it's worth. The problem with us -- for Putin, excuse me -- Putin is like a guy who has been playing at the casino in Syria. It's fantastic. He's got a big pile of chips. 

That's right. 

But he can never go to the cashier. 

And they said you can't even win here -- 

That's right, exactly. And he can't go to the cashier's booth because the minute he leaves, it all falls apart on him. So he's got a problem, too, at some point. Is he going to stay there forever propping up this guy? 

So why has he been so resistant to finding a transition government? 

Yes, I think partly because there hasn't been a lot of pressure, up to now, basically. 

And there was nothing threatening Assad on the ground that would have made him. 

Exactly. They had sort of beaten back the sane opposition. 

And all the cities like Aleppo that they had. 

Yes. And again, it gets to the mystery, Charlie, of why Assad did this now. Because in a sense, they had what they wanted. And what Assad has done by doing this is really reopening the whole case and reopening the whole question. But there is no military solution to Syria. There's only a power-sharing solution that's going to have to bring the United States, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia to the table, not to mention the very -- 

And Iran. 

Can't do it without Iran. 

Right. 

They have the main fighters. Between Iranian fighters and Hezbollah, and then Iranian, sort of mercenaries they recruited from central Asia. So mercenaries from Pakistan and other places. The Iranians are key players. 

Meantime, I'll come back to Syria, but meantime, ISIS, the battle goes on in Mosul. 

Yes. 

They have a plan using Kurds as a part of the land-based fighting force, boots on the ground in Syria. 

You know, there is no question the ISIS problem still remains there, but ISIS, it's not happening in a vacuum. It's derivative of this other issue, because ISIS was -- 

It was a recruiting tool. 

Exactly. ISIS was really a by-product of the pro-Iranian Shia militias in Iraq, and then the Maliki government trying to crush the Sunnis of Iraq, and then Assad trying to crush the Sunnis of Syria, and then you also got this Islamist trends in the Gulf feeding these guys money, you know. So, the whole region, Charlie, it's a bloody mess. It's a bloody mess because these states were basically propped up by the Cold War. 

What does it do to all the attention on Russian meddling in the American election? It kicks it off the front page for sure. 

Yes. 

The investigation continues by the FBI. 

Yes. It will continue and I think it will come back. I don't think that story is over. I don't think that story should be over. We need to know what Russia did. We need to know how they did it to prevent it next time around. 

And we need to know whether there was any coordination, collaboration, or collusion. 

Right, was there any collusion. I'm never going to sleep easily on this issue until I see Donald Trump's tax returns. There are two issues. There is the issue of actual collusion between Trump people and the Russians to tilt the election his way. From what I've seen so far, don't really see any hard evidence of that in any significant way. But then there is the question of is he compromised? And until we see his tax returns, we won't know the answer to that. I assume there is a reason he's hiding them from us. 

Clearly. Basically, the people around him says he'll never show you his tax returns. 

Exactly. I assume there is a reason for that. (LAUGHTER) That's what I care about more actually than the FBI investigation. 

There is also the summit going on in China -- I mean in Palm Beach. 

Yes. 

I forgot the title of the column you wrote but it was essentially -- 

He was doing their bidding. I said Trump is a Chinese agent, not a Russian agent. 

Not a Russian agent, because by taking these policy positions, it plays into the hands of the Chinese because alternative sources of energy can provide jobs. 

I made two points. One is that -- first I said, he says I want to be tough with China on trade. How would I get tough with China on trade? What I would do is I will organize an 11-nation trading bloc in Asia, in the Asian Pacific based on our values, our interests on trade. 

Why not call it TPP? 

Great name for it, Charlie! That's what I would do. What does Trump do the first day he comes in the office? Rips up TPP. By the way, do you know what the real story of TPP is? We can't tell anybody. Don't tell your listeners this. We fleeced all these guys in Asia. That is, we got so much of what we wanted. Why is it? Because they want to be with us. 

Right. 

Vietnamese want to be in a trading bloc with us. They got China nextdoor. 

They're scared of China. 

They're scared of China. They agreed to allow unions to organize. 

It's power. 

Exactly. So we had this great deal there. He rips it up the first day. That's day one. Day two, he gets rid of our climate research and commitment to mitigate climate change. Let's see. Here's what I would say to him. Mr. President, you don't believe in climate change, I do. Let's put that aside. That's between you and your beach house. I believe in it, you don't. Okay, we'll set that over here. Do you believe in math? Because there's gonna be -- we are at now 7.2 billion people. According to the U.N. population statistics, by 2030, we'll be at 8.1 by 2030. So another basically billion people are gonna be here by 2030, Charlie. Hopefully you and I will still be here then. Another billion people who will want to eat like us, drive like us, and live in homes like us. That is gonna put so much pressure on the planet that clean air, clean water, clean power, and energy efficiency have to be the next great global industry. Otherwise, we're gonna be a bad biological experiment. They have to be. So ladies and gentleman, please raise your hand if you think America can be the greatest economic power in the world and not lead the next great global industry. Anybody raising their hand out there? I don't think so. We're ceding it to China. China has to go down this route because they can't breathe. They don't have any choice but to invest in solar, in batteries, in efficiency. And by the way, they're doing it a holistic way, buying American companies here to do it. So for both those reasons, Trump must be a Chinese agent. Forget the Russian agent because he's ceding these two issues to China. 

That brings me to this, North Korea will be certainly topic one or two after trade, probably one because they have more serious national security implications. We need China. And as again like we need Russia on Syria, we need China on North Korea. 

Absolutely, and you can bet when they get in those really difficult trade talks, there will be some kind of trade off. I'll squeeze North Korea on this if you unsqueeze me on that. (LAUGHTER) You know, and so I think that's where the bargaining will be. 

Trump says that's his element. 

Yes, maybe he will be good at it. God bless him if he is. 

Yes. 

But, Charlie, I think our three -- we have three choices on North Korea and they were actually the same three choices that Obama faced on Iran. They are bomb, acquiesce -- 

Negotiate. 

-- or negotiate. And in the end, Obama didn't want to bomb Iran. He didn't want to acquiesce to the Iranians getting bombed, so he negotiated. And I think that the same is going to be true with North Korea. 

The interesting thing about North Korea, it seems to me, is they're further along than the Iranians. 

Yes, and that makes it much harder, Charlie. 

I'm told by people who know these kinds of things but not necessarily 100 percent right, you know, they're much closer than we even think they are. 

Yes, and that's scary. 

That's what they said, and that's scary. 

Because they are closer to having the ability to miniaturize their fissile material into warheads and now put it on intercontinental ballistic missiles that could hit Los Angeles. And that's why this is going to be a very unpleasant negotiation, because we're not gonna be able to get them back to zero for 15 years as we did with the Iranians. We'll be lucky to reduce their stockpile from maybe close to 100 to down to the tens, and stop their missile testing so they cannot perfect a system to get close to us. I think that's the best deal. The problem with North Korea is we kept chasing the perfect and giving away the good. Goes back to the Bush administration basically. And I think at some point, we'll have to bite this bullet or engage in a military action that would be horrific. There could be ten million people killed in it. We have 30,000 American troops here. Trump has some leverage. One piece of leverage he has is to say to the Chinese, I'm actually going to pull our troops out of South Korea because we're going to leave this to you. Now when that happens, then the South Koreans say, you're going? Then they're going to want to get their own nuke. And when that happens, the Japanese are going to want to get their own nuke. And so we could say to the Chinese, would you like to have a nuclear South Korea and a nuclear Japan on your doorstep? 

It is said the Japanese could do it overnight. 

I'm su
