The importance of civic education has perhaps never been more crucial to our democracy. Politicians often accuse one another of violating the Constitution, but surveys show that Americans have little understanding of the founding document. An Annenberg Public Policy Center Survey conducted last year, found only a quarter of Americans could name all three branches of government. Joining me now are two people who are determined to change that statistic. Kathleen Hall Jamieson joins from Washington. She is the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Here in New York is Robert Katzmann. He serves as a chief judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Two years ago, he launched a circuit-wide civic education initiative, "Justice For All: Courts and the Community." I am pleased to have both of them on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

Judge, of late, I think a lot of people have woken up and thought, gosh, the constitution, the supreme law of the country, that's really important. Why is it, however, that knowledge of it seems to be so slight in many cases? 

You know when I was growing up in New York, public schools of New York, civic education was so important. Our teachers understood that our democracy is fragile and that to have an understanding of that democracy, we needed to know about government. You know, it's the old line from John Dewey that for every generation, democracy must be born anew with education as its midwife. And I think that's what's happened over time is that education, civic education, has had less priority across the country than it should. 

Why is that? Surely it's basic. 

It is basic. It is basic. And certainly without knowledge of our governmental institutions, how can we expect our democracy to thrive? 

Kathleen, how dangerous is this situation? Benjamin Franklin in 1787, famously said, when asked what form of government had been created, A republic, madam, if you can keep it. Are we going to be able to keep it without the kind of civic engagement that sustains a republic, a democracy? 

There are times that are more critical than others, and times in which we are trying to balance the values of security and liberty, it is particularly important that we understand that we have three branches of government, what their roles are, and importantly, what the roles of an independent judiciary are. And what we see when we do our surveys of civic knowledge is that those who don't understand that we have three branches and what they are and what they're set to do, don't understand the checks and balances to understand why veto power is part of that, and why a veto can be overridden, and importantly don't understand independent judiciary. When you put all of those things into your equation, you ask what does that predict, it predicts a willingness to say, when the court issues an unpopular ruling, and does that more than once or twice, maybe we should think about just getting rid of the court. So part of what makes our system work is the public's belief in and understanding of the system. And when we are in difficult times, it's more important than ever that those understandings are firmly rooted. 

Are you saying that most Americans don't understand checks and balances? That seems so fundamental? How can that be? I read somewhere that ten percent of college graduates think that Judge Judy is a member of the Supreme Court, ten percent. How is this possible? And we are seeing right now just how important it is to know something about these subjects. 

I don't worry if people can't name justices on the Supreme Court. 

Yes, but Judge Judy? 

I worry if they don't understand what the Supreme Court is supposed to do. So when you ask people on a survey, what happens if there's a 4-4 Supreme Court ruling, which you can have right now because we don't have the ninth justice in place, there is a sizable percent of the population that thinks that the decision goes to the federal court of appeals. Another part of the population thinks, no, they just keep voting until they can resolve the tie. And in the survey we did two or three years back, we actually said, well, what is the other alternative? And we put in place -- it goes back to congress and congress gets to decide, and more than 20 percent of the public said, you know, that's right. Why is that important? Because when President Trump puts forward his immigration ban, his temporary suspension, and the court issues a ruling and the president defers to the ruling, the public needs to understand why the president does that, and needs to understand that is part of the checks and balances of our system actually working. 

Well, the president, judge, only deferred to the ruling after speaking about so-called judges. In six short weeks we had pretty much frontal attacks on the first amendment, on the press, enemies of the people, we don't know exactly what happened, whether any aid or comfort was given by now President Trump's coterie in the run-up to the election and after November 8th. So I have to ask you, the kind of civics lessons in the basics that you've been trying to foster, would the president himself be a good candidate for that course? 

Well, as you know, Roger, I can't get, as a judge, I can't get involved in the politics of the moment. What I can say is, and this interest that I've had in civic education is longstanding, is that each of us has a collective responsibility to understand how the institutions of government work, so that we can be respectful of those institutions. And that's why I think it's so critical to have these programs of civic education which try to educate the public, to bring communities closer to the institutions that we serve. And that's what we're doing in the Second Circuit in this project that began a couple of years ago. 

And what are the main obstacles you've encountered to that? Why hasn't more of this been happening? 

I think it's spreading. I think it's spreading. I think that there is an awareness. In our court system, Second Circuit of the courts of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont, the federal courts, at every level, the court of appeals, the district court, the magistrate court, the bankruptcy court, the judges are all engaged. We have a tremendous co-chair, Victor Marrero, the southern district of New York. And there are an extraordinary range of activities. We are working with boards of education on civics materials for textbooks and textbook revisions. We have teachers' institutes where teachers come into our courthouses, and they are paired with judges and scholars. This is a program -- 

You're finding an enthusiastic response? 

Very enthusiastic. We're doing this with the Justice Resource Center. We've got programs of reenactments where we reenact classic trials. 

And Kathleen, I will repeat to you, perhaps you'll have a little more freedom to express yourself with the question I just asked the judge. Has the president been showing insufficient respect for, even perhaps contempt for, the constitution in some of his actions and statements since he took office? 

If you will remember the president has all of the constitutional protections and we live in a country in which expression is something we value. We have to remember also that we have a press that there's to hold the president accountable and the government accountable. 

We're doing our best, we're trying. 

And in the process understand that what the first amendment does is says government isn't supposed to interfere with that right of the press to exercise its responsibilities. So at the beginning of the administration, I don't think we have to judge too early what larger questions such as the well-being of the constitution ultimately will be as a result of this presidency, this congress, this judiciary, and this moment. But I think we can say that this is a difficult moment in the nation's history because we are confronting problems that are very difficult. We've got an anxiety ridden electorate. We have an electorate that doesn't have the civics knowledge that it needs to really understand the checks and balances in our system and how they're supposed to function. And we have some rhetoric that has broken some norms that have been long lived and well established, and that's potentially problematic. 

Yes. I mean, how dangerous is the repetitive fake news accusation, even today, fake news statement tweet from the president. How -- this is very disorienting, and if people are disoriented, they no longer know their rights. They no longer know where they stand. How troubling do you find these fake news accusations emanating almost daily from the oval office? Towards "The New York Times," "The Washington Post," and other institutions that -- let's face it, we make mistakes but they are pillars of the republic. 

You know there are times in which attacks on an institution actually strengthen an institution. I am very proud of the journalism that has been developed over the course of the last two to three months. The congress has been doing its job. The president has been doing his job. The judiciary has been doing its job. The press has been doing its job as well. And to the extent that the press is vigilantly watching those boundaries and calling out those instances in which it thinks there is potential deception or misinformation, we ought to be standing up and cheering and remembering that's why the first amendment is there. The press's job is to hold government accountable, and government's job is to stay out of the press's way. 

Judge, the blurring of the lines between what's true and what's false, does that bother you? Do you think that is happening in American society generally? That a lot of people are just unable to, in the cacophony, to distinguish the two? 

I'm reminded of what a great mentor of mine once said, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He used to say that you are entitled to your own opinion, but not to your own facts. And I think that what was at the core of that was a sense that there were things -- there are things that are discernible, and that there are data that are discernible, and that -- 

Facts exist. 

Facts exist, facts exist. And I think it's important that we keep sight of the importance. 

Isn't it troubling that we even have to say that? That facts exist in 2017, in the United States of America? 

Well, you know, on the other hand, in courts all the time, there are disputes about what the facts are. This is something that courts deal with all the time. They weigh the facts. They weigh the evidence, and this is not a new enterprise for any of us. 

You know one of the important things that the court system does for us as a country and its citizenry is model standards of evidence and argument. It models the process by which one can draw inferences from available contested evidence, and come up with good judgments carefully reasoned. What we need now more than ever in the body politic is more of that kind of evidence driven, careful argument where we ask what's the link between the evidence and the assertion, and where is the evidence? And if you had to say what institution has protected that most vigilantly, you'd say it's the judiciary. And when the press is doing its job, it's a close second. 

When you think about the grand experiment that is the constitution, what is it that the framers envisioned? They envisioned the interaction of diverse institutions, congress, the executive, the courts. They envisioned the interaction of diverse elements acting, and interests acting on those institutions. And there was a sense that although each institution would act according to its own interests and incentives, together, they would create a deliberative system with outcomes that would be in the public interest. And I think that's the model that we aspire to. And I think that we shouldn't lose sight of what it is the founders had in mind, and that's why civics education is so important because if we need to change things or tweet things, having that sense of what is that constitutional document, what is that framework, is all the more important. 

It's very moving, I think, seeing the ingeniousness and foresight of the founders pitted against a contemporary situation. 

And they were so young, in their 30's, 20's, 40's, I mean, it's really remarkable wisdom in their youth. 

I'd like to ask both of you as we wind up here, do you think if there could be a new enthusiasm for education in civics that the country is very divided, red state, blue state, people think completely differently. I was a foreign correspondent a lot of my career. When I go from New York to Kentucky or Indiana, it is a foreign correspondent-type experience. Do you think this could bring the country together in some way if everybody reacquainted themselves with these basic rules? 

I wish that we could find a way to increase the likelihood that those who are in charge of a country and those who constitute the citizenry would look back at the kind of content that good civics education has and learn the lessons of the past. We learn from the Korematsu case from Japanese internment that the country can make serious mistakes when it has tried to balance security and liberty. We learned from the Cherokee nations case that when the president doesn't enforce an order of the court, we can have really consequential, hurtful times for a whole segment of our population, that gave us the Trail of Tears. We learned across time that the country can make mistakes and it needs to learn from the mistakes. When we give up on civics and understanding how we came to where we are as a nation, we may forget some of those lessons and as a result, we may have to repeat them. That would be tragic. 

Judge. 

I couldn't agree more. I think that civic education is a force that can provide the ties that bind. They can provide us with a sense of what is it that brings us together, whatever our differences might be. It is no accident that George Washington envisioned a national university, that James Madison thought that there should be a seminary of knowledge and of ideas, because out of that educational process comes better understanding, whatever our differences, because then we will be talking to one another with a common language, and we better be able to appreciate what is in this little book. 

How worried are you about the republic? Just a very short answer. I would like to hear from you both. Very, a little, somewhat? 

I am not worried about the republic in the sense that I have faith in our institutions. But more than that, I have faith in our people, that time and time again, the citizenry has met the test. There have been times when things haven't gone quite right, but yet we have met the challenge and overcome them. So I am optimistic as to the future. 

Kathleen? 

I would be less worried if we could increase the level of civics knowledge and revivify our own sense of how we've gotten to where we are including those moments in which we got things wrong, because then we can ensure that we are not going to repeat those mistakes. So when I think we are not going to recover that knowledge and we are not going to raise that level of civics awareness, I am worried more than I am if I think we are gonna be able to recover. 

Thank you very much. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
