On Thursday, lawmakers in North Carolina rolled back the state's controversial bathroom bill. That is the law passed a little over a year ago that required transgender people to use the public bathroom of the gender that appears on their birth certificate. The backlash to the law began almost immediately and it has had both economic and political ramifications. By one estimate, the law would cost the state $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years. It is also cited as a major factor in last year's governor's race which led to the election of Democrat Roy Cooper. Governor Cooper joins me now from the state capital of Raleigh. Welcome to the program. It's a pleasure to have you here. 

Thank you, Charlie, I appreciate it. 

So help us understand this new bill. What was kept, what was kicked out, and why are some people complaining about, it's too much of a compromise? 

Well, first, we never should have been here in the first place. Passing House Bill 2, the super majority Republican legislature, and my predecessor, the Republican governor, signed this horrible bill into law that discriminates against LGBT community and has hurt our state, it's put a stain on our reputation. The first thing we have done is to repeal House Bill 2. 

Right. 

We've gotten rid of this horrible requirement that you have to go to the restroom of your birth certificate. The second thing that we've done is we've opened up, immediately, the ability of local governments to put in and to have LGBT protections, and we have provided LGBT protections in the future for those local governments. It is not my preferred solution. It is not everything that I wanted, but it is progress moving forward. And I believe strongly that we need to have statewide LGBT protections in North Carolina. My super majority Republican legislature won't let me do that yet, but I'm going to keep fighting for that every single day. 

I noticed in your own statement, you've said consistently, we began, we began, we began, we began. You began to do what with this bill? 

Well, first, under House Bill 2, local governments could not provide LGBT protections for their own employees. With the bill that I signed yesterday, they now can. With House Bill 2, local governments could not provide protections or require protections for LGBT employees of companies they contracted with. Today, after the bill I signed, they can do that, and there are more protections that local governments can provide for LGBT residents in the future. And, at that time, we're sure to get those protections available for local governments. Some of those protections aren't there yet, but will be at the end of this moratorium. I think -- I know that I wanted a clean repeal with nothing additional. We had to find a compromise that moved North Carolina forward. This does that, and we have to keep fighting for it in the future. But now we do have some LGBT protections for local governments right now, and open the door for it in the future. But we've still got a long way to go in North Carolina and I want to make sure that I fight for those LGBT protections. 

Does it void anti-discrimination laws through 2020? 

Well, under House Bill 2, no local government could pass any LGBT law permanently. They were completely banned from doing that. What the legislation I signed allows them to provide some LGBT protections now, and it allows them to provide some additional LGBT protections in 2020. And what we had was a permanent ban on LGBT protections, any kind of protections that local governments would be able to do. That's what House Bill 2 did, and if we didn't get House Bill 2 repealed, we wouldn't have an opportunity to make progress. And that's what we have done with this legislation, we've made progress. We've opened the door to more LGBT protections in the future, we've opened the door to LGBT protections now with local government employees and with contracting, but we still have a lot to do, but it's progress. And it's particularly progress with a super majority Republican legislature, many of whom liked House Bill 2, wanted to keep House Bill 2 in place. 

As you know, many people have talked about, over the last year or so, the damage to North Carolina's reputation, and so have you, and also the financial impact. Did that have any impact on the Republicans in the legislature? 

I think it had an impact on some of the Republicans in the legislature. Others didn't want to repeal it at all. But we were able to get a coalition that included Republicans and the Republican leadership, and I do think that the economic effect of this -- But the guiding principle, for me, is moving people's rights forward. That should be paramount over sports or money, and what this does is move those rights forward. It doesn't move them as far forward as I want to move them. It doesn't move it as far forward as a lot of other people want to do it. A lot of people wanted clean repeal of House Bill 2. A lot of people want statewide anti-discrimination ordinances in North Carolina, and I do, too. But the alternative was to continue to suffer under House Bill 2. Continue to have transgender kids -- we'd have this requirement that they use the restroom that's on their birth certificate and keep them with that kind of message from North Carolina. That's wrong. We need to go further in protection of transgender, all LGBT citizens. And I'm going to keep fighting for those. But clearly the economic impact on our state has been great. We've been boycotted by companies and by sporting events. It's because of their belief in people's rights, too, as to why they have boycotted North Carolina. We're sending them a strong signal now that we're making progress, and we want them to come to North Carolina, we want them to come help us join this fight for LGBT rights. We want them to come back to put more money in the pockets of middle class North Carolinians, and we want to be the kind of state that we know that we are, but that hasn't been shown to the nation and the world over the last few years with the leadership that we've had. Things are changing now, and we're going to continue to work for those changes. 

Some of those who did not want to see you compromise and simply wanted to see the bill repealed, period, seemed to say that things were going your way. That there's going to be more and more pressure and if you had not compromised, you would have the ability later to do what you wanted to do. 

Yes. Well, they didn't -- they weren't in the rooms with these Republicans that I was dealing with. There was a hard opposition to changes in our law. There was a hard opposition to repeal of H.B. 2 at all. And you should have seen some of the things that they wanted that I said absolutely not. They wanted RFRA provisions that would allow people to use their religious beliefs or their conscience to discriminate against other people. I said absolutely not, we're not going to do that in North Carolina, we're not going to trade one bad law for another bad law. What I want is something that moves to end discrimination. What I want was something that helped to bring our economy back. And what I wanted was something to help remove the stain on our reputation. And this crowd was not going to repeal House Bill 2 without something else. This was the best deal we could get right now. 

How much did this bill play in your election, in a very close election? 

It was certainly part of it. I was opposed to House Bill 2 on day one, had vowed to work to repeal it, but also the cuts to public education, the refusal to expand Medicaid, the dramatic cutbacks in our Department of Environmental Quality and the anti-environmental laws that they passed. The horrible voter restrictions that thankfully most of them got overturned in the courts, but making it harder for people to register and vote and passing voter restriction laws that the court said discriminated against African-Americans with "surgical precision." That's the kind of legislation and legislators that I ran against and a governor who signed all of that and promoted all of that. That's the kind of leadership that I ran against, and it's a combination of all those issues as to why we won even in a Trump wave. As you know, North Carolina did vote for President Trump, and we were able to emerge from that election. So it was a combination of a lot of things that were going wrong in North Carolina and in those areas, we're going to have to fight to make incremental progress with this legislature, but I'm going to continue to fight in all of those areas. 

Governor, thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure to have you on the program. 

Thank you, Charlie.
