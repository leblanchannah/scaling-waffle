This city-- what does it mean to you? 

It is a city that everybody who is interested in the arts is drawn to anyway. And a lot of times, we're drawn to it sort of unconsciously, the pull of the force of gravity. The magnet is there without our being altogether sure where we're going, but there we suddenly are. And when I got here in the '30s, of course, New York, like all the great cities of the world, was in the midst of trying to struggle out of a depression. It was a very gray city and we thought then it must be dying. Surely it was dying. Sixty years later, it still too many people seems to be dying and it is more wonderful than ever. It looks more beautiful. 

You believe it's more wonderful than ever? 

Oh, in every way, including the sense of-- well, its beauty is greater than it ever was before. The grayness is gone. It's very-- it had a kind of jauntiness, a kind of-- 

Teeming with electricity. 

And it has energy that you feel coming right up out of the sidewalks and not only on hot days, but really-- 

Like today! 

--is true, creative energy. There are three cities, I think, in the United States that have that -- Chicago, L.A. and New York-- and those are the three cities-- 

The energy they have. 

Yeah, the energy. And it turns out to be a kind of creative energy and it's thrilling to be in New York. People are right to feel they're not all together alive. Henry Hope Reed, one of our local historians, has said that anybody who doesn't live in New York City is camping out and it's true. 

Do you worry about-- 

No, I don't worry about-- 

--mortality and death? 

No, no, no. 

You don't fear it all all. 

Death is just this extinction. It's more than time I went. I wouldn't want to embarrass you by dying on this program, but-- 

No, I wouldn't want you to-- well, it wouldn't embarrass me, but I don't want to see you go. 

Well, I wouldn't want to have you have to salvage-- you know, gently and delicately and saying, ``There he is.'' 

Yeah. 

But-- but-- no, no. It's a toy to die. It's a toy. I can't imagine anymore that people still feel a dread or even feel hope. Hope is worse than dread, in this case, if they think they're going to see their beloveds and the hereafter. 

Now, what do you think you're going to see when you die? 

Nothing. Like a squashed fly, this wonderful object, our brain, is a chemical apparatus and cannot possibly survive the absence of the heart pumping blood through it. We know that. There's nothing there, so nothing to dread, nothing to hope. Wonderful! 

No afterlife, huh? 

Oh, certainly not! 

No religious faith there? 

And moreover, there isn't a single description of heaven that I could bear to be a part of. 

Well, why not? I mean-- 

Oh! 

--streets laid with gold and, you know-- 

It's worse than a T.V. studio! The pendulous presence of God-- 

Yeah. 

--called ``Charlie'' by his friends, and all that intense light that never goes off-- oh, it's a nightmare! 

No. A nightmare, huh? 

A real nightmare. 

Yeah. 

A light nightmare. 

Yeah. But are-- there is this sense, to talk to you, that this has been one giant journey of fun, engagement, opportunity to know and enjoy people and to do work that you like. 

Oh, I think to this extent I'm an old-fashioned sort of Sartrian existentialist. I think that life is intrinsically meaningless and I think that we get up in the morning and do what we can, as if. I've tried always to live as if-- as if something good would come of all the little efforts I've been making in New York to do this, to do that. And if it should be the case that nothing of the as if has worked, nevertheless I haven't failed to make that attempt. 

Yeah. Now, you I-- you should write-- this is the book you ought to write, this conversation, because I am at the age, middle age now, where some of my friends and people I know are dying. For the first time, I'm going to funerals that wasn't just from-- from natural causes. And I listen to eulogies and they're all about their life and what they cared about, you know, and it makes you think of your death and then you come back and what do you want to do and what do you want to be? I mean, I happen to love the life I live and love and have some appreciation of self and like what I do and like myself, but it does make you think about what you're doing and are you doing enough, are you making enough contribution, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 

Yeah, but that is to be the great ``as if,'' and both Camus and Sartre just said our life is like being Sisyphus and you push the great rock all the way up the hill in your effort to do well, but by morning it will have rolled down again. But that isn't less reason to-- 

To push it up again the next morning. 

--start pushing. And somebody else can decide whether your life was of any value. Nobody can be very sure, at the moment of what he is doing, that that is going to have a-- be of value in 10 years or 20 years. You have some feeling of that with your family, if you haven't altogether failed with family life and all that kind of thing. What you measure is the degree to which you have not failed, rather than the degree to which you have succeeded because it's a very difficult thing to perform well. But one doesn't ask that much of oneself, so let somebody else make the decision afterward. And I would assume that people will be-- for a few years after my death, people might say, ``Oh, God. You remember the night that we did''-- And that's-- but that's not a eulogy and I wouldn't want a eulogy.
