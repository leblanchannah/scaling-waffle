We continue our discussion of the House Intelligence hearing with Karoun Demirjian and Matt Rosenberg of "The New York Times." They join us now from Washington. Karoun, tell me whether you think we'll look back at this and maybe see it as a historic turning point in this investigation. 

It's certainly a very remarkable thing when an FBI director says yes, there is an active investigation going on, basically a counter-intelligence investigation that does involve the White House. I think that's certainly a historic thing. Certainly this is also -- there were two major markers that came out today, that being one of them, and also the FBI director saying that there is no "there" there, and that the president's accusations that the Obama administration was wiretapping his phones. Now that's not the final word on any part of this investigation. There are still a lot of unanswered questions, many of them we heard Comey not answering during that hearing. So, really this is going to continue and certainly it's going to be under a crowd of politics the whole time as today's hearings was as well. But it certainly is a notable day in the progress of how that has been going. 

Was this a hard decision for the FBI director to make? 

The FBI director said that he had gotten permission basically, from the Department of Justice, that there are rare circumstances where in the public interest it actually makes sense to break his normal rule that he doesn't comment on ongoing investigations and they decided this is one of them. So, I think this has been many months in coming. He's been getting a lot of pressure from members of Congress to actually say what he said today, especially since there's already been press reports that said that there actually is an active investigation. So, having him get to this point was basically something that almost had to happen. I think a lot of people were expecting but it's still notable that he got there and he did say this because it shows the seriousness of the investigation, how much the FBI decided it had to actually make this a public declaration at this point. 

Do you know what they are saying the Russians did? 

Well, that's the thing. They are saying that the Russians were involved in meddling with the election. They have stood behind the Intelligence Committee's report from January that found that there was intervention, that there was hacking. And that it was done with the intention of trying to advance Trump's chances of winning the White House. However, beyond that, they haven't gone into full details about the extent to which these allegations that there may have been more direct collusion are actually true, as many members of Congress have said, and you just heard some people telling you, that there is no evidence yet that proves that sort of a link, but that's what they are looking into. And certainly with all these swirling allegations out there that Comey said today that they are investigating. 

Are there -- 

The specifics of exactly who they're looking at and what they found, we don't know yet because he didn't tell us yet. 

Are there informed opinions that suggest it might have made a difference, that whatever the Russians did might have made a difference in the election or is it simply the act of trying to tamper with democracy? 

I think it is the latter that is actually concerning people more. As you even heard Democrats say today, sure, maybe this had an effect but you will never be able to tell exactly which thing turned the election or turned which voter. This is not a case where, you know, Russians hacked voting machines and you can actually draw a direct line between what was done and the actual turnout and outcome of the numbers. It's a little bit more subtle than that because you're talking about information, spinning, hacking, what's entering the public news cycle at what point in the campaign. So, I don't think anybody is actually planning on being able to say yes, and this is -- the Russian interference is what determined the election. I think they are concerned though about the precedent that this sets. And Comey even said expect it to happen again in 2018, in 2020, in Europe before that. And that is a real concern when you consider how important open, transparent elections are to the progress of politics in this country. 

Thank you for joining us. I know you have another commitment so I will let you go, but thank you so much. 

Thank you. 

Matthew, having listened to what we have said so far, tell me what you would add to that in terms of these hearings, how long they may last, whether we are just looking at the beginning, are we witnessing today the unraveling of a presidency? 

I mean, I think I was amazed, as Karoun, at just the astounding nature of an FBI director getting up in front of Congress and saying yes, there is an espionage investigation involving a sitting president. I mean, that alone is just astounding. But the other remarkable thing was that there was another four and a half hours of this hearing, a lot of which was spent talking about leaks, talking about, you know, why people are talking to government and whether they should be prosecuted. I think that's going to be an issue that keeps coming up and up. Does this unravel the presidency? I don't know because, I think, you know -- Is there a "there" there? Will there be a smoking gun? These are huge questions and I think that gets back to your question about where we are in this. We're still very much at the beginning. Both the Senate and House investigators have been pretty clear that they're still going through the initial evidence underpinning the January 6th assessment about Russian meddling. They're still looking into the initial assessments and intelligence connections between Trump associates and Russia. And I think the FBI too, you know, these counter-intelligence investigations, these things can go on for years, and often, don't yield a result. They don't yield a prosecution. So I think we'll have a lot more of this and it's going be a political cloud certainly that is going to hang over this White House for a long time. 

A couple of things from what Adam Schiff said and he clearly knows a lot about this as a minority -- chief minority member of the House Intelligence Committee. It's circumstantial evidence he's primarily talking about. Meetings that you can't explain that you're talking about, but on the other hand, when you talk about whether President Obama in some way -- if he could, which they say he couldn't, have ordered something like this, you have no one who has said they have seen any evidence that that took place, that there was any surveillance. 

None. 

Of Trump Tower. 

None, I mean, that's the other basic takeaway today, is that the FBI director and the NSA chief basically said no, Mr. President, there was no surveillance. And yet the White House won't back down on this one. And I think, you know, you've got two different camps explaining out here. You got the question over the meddling and Trump associates being in connection with Russia. Then over these wiretapping claims which is beyond the point of being bizarre now. I mean, anybody who would know or should know has said, no, it didn't happen. So where do we go from here? I don't think any of us really know that. 

I assume, and lots of people are eager to know what other witnesses might be coming forth. 

I believe, and I'm not sure this has been totally confirmed yet, that you'll see at least John Brennan, the former director of the CIA; James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence; and perhaps even Sally Yates, who was the attorney general, though I think that is still being worked out. And I'm sure there will be many more hearings to go. There's also, you know, a lot of the work of the intelligence committee gets done behind closed doors. They're going to have hearings of witnesses that we are not privy to and who we don't know are testifying on what they're talking about. 

Mike, that includes some of the people who are implicated with the possibility of circumstantial evidence and the suggestion of collusion. 

I wonder and I wonder, you know, Michael Flynn's name, the former national security advisor, his name came up frequently today both by the Democrats who saw his connections and contacts with the Russian ambassador during the campaign and after the campaign during the transition, and by Republicans who were very concerned that information about those contacts was leaked to members of the media, including "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post." So there seems to be a lot of people who want to hear from Michael Flynn and may want to talk to him. 

And so the question of leaks, what exactly did Director Comey say about the leaks? 

I mean, he was pretty adamant that yes, this is illegal and it is a real problem in his estimation. I think the Republicans really wanted him to go further and pressed him to, you know, point to specific stories that he thought were false or he thought were wrong, based on leaks that were not fully informed. He wouldn't go there. He -- there was a lot of back-and-forth about how, look, I can't get into the business of saying what's right and what's wrong. So, when I say one-story is wrong, that the leaks in there are not correct, the ones that I don't say that about, well, then by implication, can be considered accurate. But, there was, you know, I think it was just one of these situations where the Republicans really, not all, but a number of Republicans wanted to make this the main issue and neither the director nor the NSA Chief wanted to do that. 

What evidence has been presented -- what do we know about whether Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, ordered this? 

You know, this is the other problem that this investigation is going to face and that this entire story faces, is that a lot of this evidence is described to us but we don't get to see it because it's classified. We're told there are intercepts. We're told there is, you know, a number of bits of information but mostly a lot of intercepts, a lot of communication intercepts and human intelligence that points or indicates that this came from Vladimir Putin. This was ordered by him. But, you know, you and I are never going to see the transcripts of those calls or even get readouts of them. And that's going to present a challenge going forward because it does raise doubts. You know, how do you say, "Well, this happened definitively, these guys were involved. There was a Trump person talking to Russian X." We have to take somebody's word for that because we can't see it. 

How long do they expect the House Intelligence Committee hearings to last? 

You know, nobody's putting a timeline on this. I know on the Senate side, they told me it will go as long as it takes them and the House side seems to be taking a similar approach, and this could go on a very long time, probably because they depend on the FBI and the Intelligence Committee which is still collecting intelligence. The FBI is still investigating and as long as they are doing that, these investigations can't be wrapped up. And how long the Intelligence Committee and law enforcement is going to keep going on their investigations is something that nobody is saying, it really could take years. 

Any evidence that President Trump has begun to believe or see that this is getting in the way of the onward movement of his own agenda and his goals for what he might do in the first 100 days? 

I mean, I imagine there has to be some recognition of that at the White House, but they don't seem to be acting on that information in a way that would keep it from being an issue. You know, just this morning, the president is tweeting again, this is fake news. The whole Russian meddling story is fake news. During the testimony itself, Comey said, you know, the Russians -- and Rogers said -- there's no indication that Russian hackers interfered with vote tallying. Then, that later became, in a tweet from the White House, the official presidential account, being a tweet saying, "Comey and Rogers say there's no Russian influence in the election whatsoever," which is not what they said. And during the hearing, when they were read those tweets back by one of the congressman, they went out and said, "No, we didn't say that. We were not assessing whether the meddling had an influence and affected the results." So, the White House seems to find a way to keep this going. And, you know, there are all kinds of theories, is it a distraction, are they just fumbling around? I don't know that. But I do know that they don't seem to have recognized how much damage this is doing and that they are, at this point, helping perpetuate it. 

Matt, thank you so much, pleasure. 

Thank you. 

Back in a moment, stay with us.
