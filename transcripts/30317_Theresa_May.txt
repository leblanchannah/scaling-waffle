We begin this evening with Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May formally moved Wednesday to begin Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, Prime Minister May set in motion an arduous two-year process of negotiations. She outlined her vision for Britain's departure from the bloc in January, indicating the U.K. would seek a hard Brexit and leave the E.U.'s single market. Addressing parliament today, the prime minister described it as an historic moment from which there can be no turning back. 

Britain is leaving the European Union. We are going to make our own decisions and our own laws. We are going to take control of the things that matter most to us. And we are going to take this opportunity to build a stronger, fairer Britain, a country that our children and grandchildren are proud to call home. 

Joining me now from Washington, David Rennie of "The Economist;" here in New York, John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of "Bloomberg;" Nicholas Wapshott of "Newsweek;" and Charles Kupchan of the Council on Foreign Relations. I'm pleased to have all of them on this program. Let me begin by quoting William Hague, he called this the most complex divorce ever in history. Why is it that? 

Well, it's incredibly complex in terms of how you divide this -- you've got two people, you've got unbelievably complicated negotiations to do with trade. We had a piece today pointing out that, 250,000 dogs and cats go across the British channel every year. Trying to work out how the pet passports work, that would take several months of negotiation. You've got people, you've got trade, you've got services, You've got all these different bits. And so that bit is immensely complicated. But the other bit is really kind of horribly simple, it's very like a divorce with one side, the British, saying please be reasonable. I know we've deserted you and we've run away but please be reasonable, and the rest of Europe probably saying not. 

What is the difference in hard and soft Brexit, Charles? 

I think initially the Brits thought that they could get a soft Brexit, which meant that they could get some relief from the E.U. on immigration, some relief on some of the issues that made people most uncomfortable such as ever closer union, and retain generally sustained access to the single market. And over time, I think, Theresa May and her colleagues realized that it ain't going to work that way. If they're going to step back and not adhere to the main freedoms that all other E.U. members adhere to, they are not going to have access to the single market. And so the bottom line is that Britain exports almost 50 percent of its goods and services to the E.U. When they step out of the world's single market, they're going to take a huge economic hit. They're going to lose political influence because their voices won't be heard in European counsels. They could threaten the unity of the country because the Scotts and the Irish, are they going to stick around? And just the sheer opportunity costs. 

And might the French stick around if there is a change because of this election? 

Well, that is really in some ways the $6 million question. Because Europe can and will survive Britain's exit. I'm not sure Europe could survive Le Pen because it would so threaten Franco German coalition and the trends in Europe pushing them in a populist direction, pushing them to extremes. I think it would strike a blow at the very solidarity that keeps Europe together. 

How important is Angela Merkel in this? 

She's very important because she is, after all, the leader of Europe. She's probably also the leader of the free world. And what she says, the tone that she sets is very important. And she will try in the first instance, anyway, to be as accommodating as possible and reasonable as possible. But as the two years, these are very timed negotiations, so the clock is ticking starting today with Article 50. Two years is going to take a great deal of negotiation, a great deal of backward somersaults, ingenuity, late-night sittings, all of this. 

What will be the hardest negotiation? 

It will be over exactly how much the tariff is that British goods will have to pay in order to reach European markets. 

Yes. 

Now, of course, Europeans also sell a lot of goods into Britain. And also industries are amazingly complex. We've had 50 years of this, which means whatever you produce in Europe, you're very likely to make it in more than one country, several countries. And so, to extricate yourself from all of those nitty gritty of 50 years of involvement, it is just like a divorce, except it's a divorce that comes very late in life. Imagine you are in your 60's, and you're trying to fire your childhood sweetheart, that's what it's going to be like. And it's horrible. It's horrible. 

Yes. There's also this, President Obama was there -- referencing the point you made, Charles -- and he said don't do this because you have more influence in Europe, in the councils of Europe, than you will independent. 

I think that's true. I think that's very much the view you get from the American side at the moment. The Americans have two big points. Economically they love the idea of London as a base, and here particularly talking about people at the banks. Every big American banker, I just saw one this afternoon, they want to stay in London and they want to just have a passport to operate throughout Europe. That was the brilliant thing about London. But you also hear this from diplomats, spooks, and politicians. It was very convenient for America to have Britain as a sort of interlocutor with Europe. In relations, yes, Obama got on well with Mrs. Merkel. Trump hasn't altogether got off to a good start on that one. The whole idea of having to restructure the west in the way that America likes to have it, that's very difficult. And it did give Britain -- Britain, for all this talk about the special relationship, a big part of it was the ability to be able to interpret what Europeans thought to America in a way that the Americans understood. 

I want to talk about security from two angles. First of all, the sharing of security from intelligence agencies and that kind of thing, is that going to be affected by this? 

We don't know yet. I mean, that's part of what will be under discussion. I'm guessing that when it comes to the sharing of intel particularly on terrorism, on what's going on in the Middle East, we've made a lot of progress during the last few years, sharing intel across the Atlantic and within Europe. So I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of that is sustained. I worry more about number one, the degree to which Britain's exit from the E.U. will change the E.U. in ways that Americans may not like. It may be less market oriented. It may be less interested in expansion. And so, we Americans are now having to ask, who is going to replace the Brits? Is it going to be the Nordics? Is Spain going to play that role? And there's also, I think, the broader question of -- when you take Brexit and put it next to what's happening here, it really does put into historical relief the possibility that the last 200 year period of history that we've been living in could be coming to an end because Pax Britannica was in many ways the forerunner to Pax Brittanica. Yeah, there were empires, but there was rule of law, there was a rules-based international system, political rights, civil rights, and that kind of morphed over World War II into what today is Pax Americana. The Brits are stepping out. We now have in the White House someone who is not sure that he buys in to this rules-based international system. And that raises very serious questions about if the architects of the West are both now having indigestion about the world that they built, who is going to defend it? 

But again, I do think there is the point that we could look back on this period and there could be an essay question which people set for children in 20 years' time. And it will be, the classic one will be, "Angela Merkel, did she use all the power she had in Europe's interest or not?" And she has been the dominant figure in Europe now for close to ten years. 

She has an election as well. 

She has an election. But she's managed to keep Europe together. That has been a great achievement. But that does not necessarily -- she hasn't necessarily managed to transfer that in to making the inner bit of Europe more cohesive. There is a possibility. Charles is saying, if La Pen wins in France, if she calls a referendum on the euro, on the euro, not on the remaining European Union, she would stand a good chance of winning that. And then suddenly the whole European project is in danger. And the big question will be did Angela Merkel who has, I agree, she has been the most impressive politician for a very long time. But did she use that? Did she really, really -- 

In Europe or compared to? 

I think you could argue over the past ten years she's been a -- you could argue how good Obama is and things like that -- but you could argue she's been, in terms of the state craft of keeping a difficult thing together, she's probably been better than anybody else. Her ability to rule politics, her ability to wipe out opposition of any sort, both within the European Union and within her country, those are very hard to beat. 

David, I want to bring you in, pick up what you've heard so far and tell me what you agree with. 

So, I think if Americans viewers are wondering why this is directly going to affect them, I think one really fascinating point is that you're going to have this ugly divorce argument involving 28 countries, Britain and the other 27. But I think Donald Trump could be a kind of shadow 29th figure at the table. It's really interesting. I think the dynamic that Theresa May, she came over to Washington here quickly. Let's try to make the point that maybe Britain could show that it has other options, it can sign a free trade deal rather quickly with Donald Trump, going against what Barack Obama said last year that Britain would have to wait at the back of the queue. I talked to a European ambassador this week who was saying he was really struck by how Republicans on Capitol Hill, for example, seem to imagine there's actually a quick free trade deal to be done where Donald Trump shows he's enthusiastic about Brexit, it's rather a good idea. It fits his worldview. But here's the thing, I actually -- it's really hard for Donald Trump to do a free trade deal with Britain, partly because Britain won't know the terms of its own trade with Europe. But also the politics could very quickly get very, very tricky for someone like Theresa May because Donald Trump is really, really unpopular across a lot of Europe. So if Britain is seen as a kind of Trojan horse, as part of a kind of Trumpian nationalist movement breaking up the European Union, and that Britain somehow wants to ally itself with America in that, there things get really, really hard. So I think Donald Trump is going to, whether he likes it or not, he's going to be a player in this argument. 

I think --he's made a very smart point there -- that there is no doubt that one of the reasons the Europeans have always suspected Britain. One of the reasons they weren't invited in the first place to join the very foundation of the European community back in the coal and steel community, back in 1947/8, was that they suspected that Britain was a sort of Trojan horse. That Churchill and Roosevelt had got on too well together. That the Brits always were making excuses. They also talk about Anglo Saxon economics, it's a different thing. Europeans practice a different sort of economics. And they suspect, therefore, all British prime ministers of being too cozy with American presidents, and with some good evidence, by the way. I mean, Tony Blair was happy to jump in to bed, as it were, with both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush in short order, and nobody seemed to mind. So there's a certain amount of good riddance which will be -- 

There is a little bit of anti-Americanism in the reaction to Britain. 

And that will be very important when it comes to negotiation. Because that sense of just get out of here, we could do without you anyway. We didn't really want you to be a member of our club anyway. That's quite a strong sentiment among a lot of people in -- 

On the continent. 

Yes. 

What happens if there is no agreement after two years? 

If there is no agreement after two years, they're gone. And they just play by WTO rules and it would be very ugly. Because tariffs would go up. A lot of bankers and other companies are going to ship out and move to Paris and Frankfurt and other places, come here to New York. And it may be that that's where we end up because it's going to be, as you were saying, one hell of a tough negotiation. 

And Charlie, you asked about security. There is another big issue here which is, I don't want to over, sort of, exaggerate Britain's kind of importance as, you know, the most important country in the world. But America, over the years, has invested a lot in things like peace in Northern Ireland. Now, if you crash out of the European Union, there are scenarios where a hard border kind of has to reappear between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Scotland, there are economic reasons why Scotland may choose to stay in the United Kingdom still, but the politics have got more tempting for Scotland to say, well, maybe we want to stay in Europe. America, for among other things, parks its nuclear submarines in bases in Scotland. It's the only place in the U.K. that you can park a nuclear submarine. Scotland goes away, suddenly there is a real crisis about what to do with Britain's nuclear deterrent and that's quite important to America. So there are extraordinary kinds of risks that cascade out from a hard departure without a deal. 

David, Martin Wolf argued in the "Financial Times" that Brexiters must lose if Brexit is to succeed. Can you unpack that for me? 

Yes. I think that the Brexiters have basically told the British public that they can have full sovereignty and full control over everything from not having to listen to the European Court of Justice, total control over immigration, and that they're not going to get any poorer, that they can have all the prosperity that they currently have from trading with a single market. We certainly, the economists would argue that's always been untrue. And so they are going to have to lose because they're going to have to make some concessions if they want. If they don't want to have voted to become poorer, if they do want to continue trading profitably and to be a dynamic successful modern western country, then they are going to have to make some concessions which currently they're denying in terms of being in some ways subject to European rules. Imagine an American pharmaceutical company that makes advanced medicines in the U.K. -- it happens quite a lot at the moment. We crash out. Does that American pharmaceutical company want to be subject to British rules and then a completely separate set of European rules? It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense for an American company to have a faction in the U.K. under those terms. So actually, to make this work, the Brexiters are going to have to break some of their promises to their own supporters. 

Very quickly, we are, most of us all, and this is not atypical of the commentary -- we all, most economists would also say this is a situation where Britain can only -- it's a question of how much Britain loses. And the other question is whether Europe loses a bit or not, because the Europeans will lose by not having a financial center and all those things. And so we're on that side of the argument. There is another group of people, perhaps not as big among the comment area, but certainly big in terms of voters, who would say, look, this is Britain's great opportunity to become -- 

Singapore. 

Become the Singapore-on-Thames. And it's not -- you know there are two groups of people who back Brexit. One group was people who didn't like foreigners, anti-immigrant. There was another group who quite genuinely and honestly thought this is the chance to get free of the Brussels bureaucracy. And at least one part of their argument, which I will put -- I don't agree with it, but I think is very clear, is they would say look at the European Union, it is in trouble. It's only going to get worse. We are better outside it. And I think the counterfactual of what happens to Europe, as Charles was saying, that is incredibly important. If the European Union becomes a success or continues roughly the same, then maybe the British will look stupid. But if, on the other hand, the European Union just gets evermore in-built, it doesn't deal with these problems, then maybe the British will look slightly clever after moving away from it. 

I think at the end of the day, like our election here, that referendum was not really about a careful analysis of the facts. What's going to happen to the economy? What's going to happen to our influence? It was really about emotion and identity. And I think that's where Cameron went wrong. He went up there with pie charts and said, here growth, here exports, stay in. The other side was saying the Turks are coming. We got to reclaim traditional Britain. A lot like what was going on here. And so, it's in many respects this kind of disaffected, the folks who feel they're on the losing end of globalization, rising up in the United States, rising up in Britain, and trashing the political establishment. Now they've got to live with it. 

Thank you. Thank you, David. 

Thank you. 

Alyssa Mastromonaco is here. She is president of global communications at A&E Networks. Prior to this, she was President Obama's director of campaign operations, and later his deputy chief of staff. She was one of the president's longest serving advisors. She was often referred to as one of the most important people in government that you haven't heard of. She has just written a memoir about her time in government. It is called, "Who Thought This Was a Good Idea? And Other Questions You Should Have Answers To When You Work At the White House". And it has just reached number ten on the "New York Times" best-seller list. I am pleased to have Alyssa Mastromonaco back at this table. So really, tell me why you wrote the book. 

So, I wrote the book because I think that there is a sort of preponderance of memoirs out from the White House, and out of government that are really very serious and dense and don't necessarily give young people, especially young women, a path to government or to see themselves in government. Deana Perino actually did a book, but other than that, there aren't that many. And so, I wanted to write something that made the government and the White House seem accessible. 

And a place that you could go and work and feel good about it. 

Yes, and still just be a normal person. You don't have to be Wonder Woman. (LAUGHTER) 

Well, you were Wonder Woman, weren't you? 

I mean, I was, but I had my share of problems. (LAUGHTER) 

How did you meet Barack Obama? 

I met Barack Obama in December of 2004. Robert Gibbs had worked for him on his senate race. I had just lost -- I worked on the Kerry campaign which had just lost. And Robert Gibbs sent me an AOL instant message that said, how are you? Do you need work? And I said I did. And so, that was -- that was, I met with then Barack Obama. 

Senator Obama. 

Senator Obama two weeks later. 

Yes. And so what job did you get? 

So I was sort of an advisor, and I did his schedule and his political work before I went over eventually to become the political director of the political action committee. 

Political director of the political action committee. 

Yes. 

How would you define the relationship between the two of you? 

We are sort of like big brother, not much younger sister. (LAUGHTER) That's what he would say. 

That's what he would say. 

I'm not that much younger. 

Yes. He also took an interest in your dating life, did he? 

He did. I think that he saw how hard we all worked, and that we were there sort of supporting him, so he felt really responsible for making sure we had personal lives. So he did try to set me up on a date or two. 

Do you think he's going to end up spending a lot of time the rest of his life as a writer. 

It seems to be, it seemed to me, the thing that he deeply enjoyed doing, that he really invested his time, that he really sort of got into. 

What -- he also had speechwriters. 

He did. 

So how did that work out? 

So, I think that there are so many things to be written in the White House, and on a campaign, you know, a campaign, you're doing three events a day. In the White House you're doing at least one event a day. So, you know, Jon Favreau, especially, and Cody Keenan, who were his speechwriters, his chiefs of speechwriting, they had such a sort of mind meld with him that they could talk to him and know where he wanted to go, and then he would take it, and it would be a back and forth and just a really good partnership. 

There were some that he wrote really himself like during the speech on religion during the campaign. 

Yes, the race speech. And then -- yes, there were some that were just so personal to him, his remarks at Newtown, at the memorial at Newtown after the shooting, things like that he just felt he had to do himself. 

He said that was the worst day of his presidency. 

Yes, I'd say we would all say that was the worst day that you ever could have been in government. 

Because so many young innocent people died. 

I mean it was a tragedy beyond description. 

This country still has not changed on gun control, has it? 

No, it hasn't. And you have to wonder
