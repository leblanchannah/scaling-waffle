Good evening, I'm Jeff Glor filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin tonight with politics. After delivering a well received address to Congress on Tuesday night, President Trump and his administration are mired in controversy again. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. This followed new revelations that Sessions met with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. in the lead-up to November's election. Sessions addressed the situation at a news conference late yesterday afternoon. 

I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaign for president of the United States. I went on to say this announcement should not be interpreted as confirmation of the existence of any investigation or suggestive of the scope of any such investigation. 

While several top Democrats have called for Sessions to resign, President Trump has remained stoutly behind him. Joining us from Washington is Eric Lichtblau of "The New York Times" and Karen Tumulty of "The Washington Post." Thank you both for joining us. Karen, let me start with you, what's next on the Sessions front? 

Well, I think what is next is what has been going on all along which is sort of the drip, drip of more and more reports of contacts of people in the president's circle with the Russians or with Russian officials. What's really surprising I think at this point, and perhaps it is a reflection of the fact that the White House is populated primarily with campaign aides and not sort of seasoned Washington hands, is that the Trump team seems to have not sort of gotten its arms around what the facts are here -- you know, who had contacts, how many -- and if they don't, this appears like it could be headed toward some sort of outside, even a, you know -- either a select committee or some kind of outside investigation. There is talk on the Hill. I don't know how far that would get, about the need for some kind of special prosecutor in this. But unless the White House and the president can get ahead of all these revelations, you know, it is going to turn into something bigger. 

Is that why they're not getting ahead of this, Karen, in your estimation, because they're not the insiders? 

I think that is one explanation because, of course, you know, the first impulse, the first rule in the playbook on a campaign is if somebody hits you, you hit them back. I think people who have been around these sorts of issues from the perspective of having been in government for them, again, know the first thing you do is get your facts straight. I think the other problem here is the president's tendency to personalize what are big issues with big implications. So he has framed this in tweets, in his statements as some sort of just beefing on the part of Democrats over the fact that they didn't win the election, as opposed to an actual, you know, threat to the security of the country. He hasn't denounced the Russians. He hasn't talked about getting to the bottom of this. He hasn't talked about how the United States should respond. 

Another rule is, if you know there is something bad out there, you try to put it out on your own terms in the first place, but as you mentioned, if you don't know it in the first place, you can't put that out to begin with. Eric, let's talk about this circle of Russian contact. Karen mentioned it obviously is wider than just Jeff Sessions. How wide is that circle right now? 

Well, we're learning more every day about Trump campaign people who had contacts with Russian officials. Jeff Sessions was the big one this week. Michael Flynn two weeks ago was fired for not being candid about his relations with the same ambassador, with Kislyak, during the transition. We're hearing more names, Carter Page was another, Gordon. As Karen said, drip, drip, drip, that is certainly the daily impact of all this. It's notable I think, mostly, because of all the denials from the White House, from Trump himself and his aides that there have been any contacts. They have been categorical for weeks even before the inauguration, in saying there were no contacts, period. This is fake news, this is a ruse. Now you have these contacts coming out which, for instance, Jeff Sessions explains as nothing insidious. There is always, you know, the axiom in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime if they had been more forthright and perhaps if the White House had known, as Karen suggests, that these contacts had happened, they could have gotten out ahead of it. Now it looks like they were denying something that is now turning out to be true. 

We've all seen these pictures of Sergey Kislyak now, right, all over the place? Tell me a little bit about him, if you could, Eric. 

He is a long-time Washington presence. He has been the ambassador to Washington for nine, ten years. He is known for throwing excellent parties, cognac, et cetera, and he knows how to work Washington in terms of going to Washington events, inviting prominent people, current ambassadors, past ambassadors, future ambassadors from the U.S. to the embassy, also to the Russian version of Camp David outside Maryland where he hosts some fabulous parties. The last few months with all the talk about Russia's meddling in the election has made him, a little bit of, I don't want to say quite persona non grata, but has caused a little bit of a chill with people being less willing to socialize or take meetings with him. And Jeff Sessions has now found that out himself. 

Karen, the word "spy" is thrown around. I know the Russians push back on that severely. How do we describe what Sergey Kislyak's role and job is? 

Well, certainly the rumors have long been out there that he is either a spy recruiter or obviously gathering intelligence himself. Let's face it, that is, in fact, part of an ambassador's job is to learn as much as possible. So you're right, the Russians are pushing back against that. They're saying he is, you know, a topnotch diplomat, not a spy. But again, this has been sort of the reputation he has had in, especially in intelligence circles in Washington. 

I don't think it matters whether he is really a covert spy and there have been denials he probably isn't, but he is outwardly gathering intelligence. He doesn't have to sneak around in the shadows in alleys. He is meeting with prominent Washington people and he's no doubt passing reports back to Moscow that end up in the hands of intelligence agencies about. Hey, I just met with Senator Sessions who is the key foreign policy advisor for the Republican nominee. Whether he is officially a spy or not is almost irrelevant, I think. 

Also to that point Eric, part and parcel of his job is meeting with lawmakers, whatever side of the aisle they're on and whether that contact is inappropriate or not. 

Well look, the question we we're all asking in Washington is whether these contacts were evidence of something more sinister, was there collusion, is the word that the Democrats keep using. Was there just contact which, of course, had been denied for a long time, or was there some more active engagement during the election season, when, remember, the Russians were actively hacking into the DNC e-mails and John Podesta's e-mails and giving those to WikiLeaks and doing serious harm to the election. Was there anyone in the Trump campaign that knew about or was involved in that effort? That is the ultimate question here. 

Because, Karen, the one Kislyak-Sessions meeting in particular in September was at the very end and in the primary heat of this campaign, correct? 

Yeah, but I really think that, you know, had he been forthright about this in his confirmation hearing when he was, after all, under oath, had he been forthright about this, had he said, you know, I had this meeting, but it was just in the course of my duties as a senator and we talked about foreign policy, it might have caused a stir for a day or two. The real damage right now is being done by the fact that he said there had been no contacts, and then he had come back and tried to parse his sentence and claim that he said something he didn't which is that there had been no communications about the campaign. That is not what he said. 

Because, Eric, he has two issues, he has the testimony and the written response. 

Sure, and I was at the press conference yesterday and I asked him directly, did the campaign or Trump's name come up? And he said, well, I don't recall, which is never a good line in Washington and he said, well, you know, these ambassadors gossip about politics and it was the middle of the campaign but I don't specifically recall politics being discussed and that, to be honest, seemed like a somewhat evasive answer. 

Karen? 

I know, especially at that time in Washington, you know, basically, people were discussing the election with strangers on the subway. 

Karen, one can understand why the administration would push back against a potential special prosecutor. It happened to Bill Clinton and resulted in his impeachment. What might the time frame be or where are the swells going as far as any potential special prosecutor involved in the Russian investigation? 

Well, first of all, there is no law now that allows the kind of independent counsels that we saw during the Clinton administration, the independent counsel statute has expired, so it could not be, again, the kind of sweeping wide-ranging, you don't know where this is going kind of investigations that we saw in the late '80s and in the '90s. But it's just really hard to say where it goes. If these kinds of revelations keep coming on a daily and sometimes practically an hourly basis, there is going to be something. By the way, that isn't the only model we have. I mean, there is also the possibility that the president himself might want to call for something, some sort of commission headed under bipartisan respected leadership, the way that Ronald Reagan did for instance as Iran Contra was breaking, the way that George W. Bush did after 9/11 when there were growing questions about, you know, what had happened to allow the attacks, what could we do to prevent them in the future? There's an argument, you know, that I think that could be made that perhaps the president should step out here and say, look, you know, if in fact -- you know, we need to get to the bottom of whether this is a threat to our security and what we should do about it. 

Eric for Democrats right now, Russia is the first, second, and third plan of attack. 

Absolutely. They obviously thought that Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the case was not enough. They've called for his outright resignation. They called for an investigation into possible perjury in what he told the judiciary committee. They obviously can make some political hay out of this for quite a long time, and having been on the defensive now for as long as they have, I think you clearly see them seizing that. 

Karen, this obviously is the big story that's consumed much of the end of this week, at least, a week that started, relatively speaking, on pretty positive terms for the president after his speech on Tuesday night. From your reporting and what you've seen there, how much disappointment and frustration is there from the White House right now that the week that they had and the positive notes they had have sort of turned sour? 

I think there is a great deal of frustration, not only from the White House but from their Republican allies on Capitol Hill, because, you know, one of the antidotes to all of this is for the president to be seen governing, for the conversation in Washington to switch from this to his policy agenda. And, you know, if so many of those initiatives weren't running into trouble on Capitol Hill, that might actually happen, and that was what he was trying to do with his speech earlier this week. 

Eric, what can we anticipate? Whether it is this story or the tentacles that come from it over the weekend and into next week? 

Well, I think there probably will be more revelations in the media as there have been all this week. Next week, I think the focus will be, somewhat surprisingly, on the confirmation hearing for the deputy attorney general, the U.S. attorney in Maryland, Rob Bornstein, who will be overseeing this investigation now that Sessions has recused himself, so that will turn into a somewhat unexpected event over Russia, because now that has landed in his lap and he is about to come up for confirmation. So I think that will be the immediate focus. You will see ongoing calls from Democrats, and even from some Republicans like Jason Chaffetz and Congressman McCarthy for further action. The Republicans called for recusal which they now got, but, you know, I think the public in general wants answers. I think there is an awful lot of confusion out there and an awful lot of unanswered questions as to what really happened, and you see people wanting to get to the bottom of that as best you can. 

And Karen, the Twitter countdown clock has been reset, right, with the president's talk of Democrats and what he considers their obstruction on his appointees? 

You know, I think that is true, as well, although he now finally does have a cabinet. 

Are there lessons to be learned, Eric, from how the appointment process has taken and those who have moved relatively smoothly through it versus those who've had very rough times and in some cases withdrawing, are there lessons to be learned for the Trump administration or future administrations for that matter? 

Well, I think the confirmation process has obviously become much more adversarial than it ever was before, partly that's because of the growing gridlock in Washington the last few years, partly that's because of President Trump and the feelings he engenders in Democrats. You know, we used to, you know, four or five administrations ago, you would routinely get cabinet nominees approved 97-0 or 98-1. That ain't happening anymore, and we're now seeing straight party line votes, much more contention hearings, questions about the honesty now of three of Trump's nominees and statements that they gave in their confirmation hearings and things that turned out to be untrue. So it's become, you know, much more political theater and really hand-to-hand combat than it ever was before. 

Eric Lichtblau from "The New York Times," Karen Tumulty from "The Washington Post," we appreciate both of your time. 

Great to be here. 

Thank you, pleasure.
