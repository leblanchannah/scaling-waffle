-- coming up. 

Michael Kaiser's been called the ``Mr. Fixit of performing arts institutions.'' Over the past 15 years, he has revived the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, the Washington Opera, the American Ballet Theater and many others. In 1998, he was appointed executive director of the Royal Opera House in London. In his short time there, he was credited with rescuing the company from financial ruin. This year he took over as president of the Kennedy Center in Washington. Already Kaiser has scored a major coup with the recent announcement of a gift from arts patron Alberto Vilar. The $50 million donation is the largest ever made to the 30-year-old performing arts center. It makes Michael Kaiser very happy. Welcome to the broadcast. 

Thank you very much. 

How does this happen? I mean, all of a sudden, there is a man who says, ``I''-- tell me the story. 

Well, I met Alberto in London when I was at the Royal Opera House, and we were fund-raising really aggressively to finish the reconstruction of the opera house. And he expressed some interest in the project through a friend of mine. And we got together, and he decided to make a major 

To the Royal Opera House. 

--to the Royal Opera House, to the finishing of the building. And then he made a second large gift to establish a young artists program. And we became friends in this process. And when I decided to come to the Kennedy Center, he said he wanted to help, and we talked through some projects. And there was the grant. 

Thirty million dollars! 

Fifty million dollars. 

Fifty million dollars! That's help, isn't it. 

It's a big help. 

Why does he do it? 

He has a true-- 

Other than just to help. 

He has a true passion for the arts. He truly loves the arts. And when he meets people in the arts who he trusts, then he decides to invest in them. And it's a wonderful relationship. I think he enjoys his patronage, and we obviously enjoy his patronage, as well. 

We should have more of that. 

Well, I think-- 

And I say that not to be glib, but it is this notion of the significance of culture to the life blood of a nation. And in America, culture needs support. 

Absolutely, it needs support. But I have to say, having worked on the other side of the ocean, I take great pride in being an American because of the huge number of people in this country comparatively who are willing to put their own personal money into the arts. 

There's more government support in countries across the ocean and less private, and here more private and much less government. 

That's true. But what's happening in Europe -- and it's very scary -- is that governments are being forced to cut back on their arts patronage. And the arts institutions there do not really know how to cope with that change because they don't know how to build a private philanthropy. 

And there's no tradition. 

There's no tradition, and there's really no expertise. And one of the reasons that Mr. Vilar gave us this big gift was to establish an arts management training program to train both Americans and foreigners in how do you run an arts organization in this world today. 

Why can't arts institutions make it on their own? Why can't they be profit-making? 

The central problem is one of productivity. In any other industry, you become more productive over time. But we still use the same number of singers to sing Don Giovanni as when it was written 300 years ago. 

Yeah. 

We still have the same number of seats in the Kennedy Center as when it was built 30 years ago. 

And it wouldn't work to have a computer do it, would it. 

No. So we can't improve productivity the way you can in any other industry, and that means over time, it gets harder and harder economically. 

But revenues go up. 

But revenue can't go up to accommodate all of the cost increases, the cost increase is greater than the ability to generate ticket revenue. So you have to look for private support. 

Is there a difference in the appreciation of the arts in other countries, especially Europe, than in America? 

I think there's maybe more of a tradition of attending the classical arts in Europe, although I have to say that we've had incredible growth in this country in attendance at symphonic performances, at operas, at ballet. So I have to say that I've noticed people all over the world enjoy good art. And I've worked in South Africa, and I've worked in London, and I've worked in this country. And if the art is good, people are there. 

How did you get to this kind of work? 

I had a very unusual sort of schizophrenic background. I was trained as an opera singer. I was very, very interested in music and in performing. I just wasn't very good, and I was much better at my studies of math and science. And so I ended up studying economics-- 

Yeah. 

--and had a business career, but also this great love for the arts, and eventually decided that I really was going to do the arts full-time, and here I am. 

And arts need people with sort of superb management skills. 

They do, but it's very important that-- to recognize the difference in running a corporation from running an arts organization. The big difference is one of mission. It's very easy to measure your success in a steel company, an automobile company. If your stock price is high and stays high, you've done a great job. In the arts, it's harder to measure success. Is it your reviews? Is it your attendance? Is it your balance sheet? It's much harder. 

How do you measure it? 

It's a personal measure, a feeling that you have done great art and that you've done great education and that many, many people have been edified by your work. It is not by your income statement at the end of the year, and if the organizations I ran simply had erased their deficits but had produced bad art, I wouldn't have felt like I had been successful. 

You said something interesting which I actually believe in. You know, I have a great appreciation of risk and the idea that, you know, if you don't dare, you will not, you know, find greatness. You once said that you have to have in your budget room for failure. 

Absolutely. If you're going to produce art, you're going to produce some failure. And you have to plan for that economically, and you also have to play for it emotionally. You have to-- you have to get your patrons and your board and your staff ready for not succeeding every now and then. And you hope your track record is a good one at the end of the day, but there will be failure. 

Talk about the Kennedy Center. Now, I mean, you came from-- you've had experience at great institutions and great artistic troupes, or sort of communities. What-- how-- where is the Kennedy Center in terms of where it ought to be, in terms of the reputation and the place it stands in the nation? 

It's a very good question-- 

Does it need work? 

Well, I think every arts organization needs work. And if you're in the arts, you're always striving for perfection, and you never get there. 

Yeah. 

I think the Kennedy Center has done a fantastic job of building high-quality programming in a range of the art forms because the Kennedy Center presents opera and ballet and theater and symphonic music and chamber music and jazz. It's a very wide portfolio. What one is always trying to do is to try and increase the amount and the quality of the programming and of the educational programming. The Kennedy Center does more arts education than any other organization in the world. 

What's arts education? 

It is introducing children to the arts. It is introducing adults to the arts. It is-- it is training young musicians. It's a whole range of programming that we work on throughout the United States. We work in 50 states of the union, and I think that's something that we don't maybe know about the Kennedy Center. And so I'll say that one of the areas I need to work on the most with the Kennedy Center is the marketing because we do a lot more programming in a lot more places than people know of. 

An example? 

We will be going to Oklahoma next month with the National Symphony Orchestra and having a residency where they will be playing concerts and working with children, introducing them to symphonic music throughout the state of Oklahoma. 

Yeah. 

And I'm sure you won't know about that. 

No, you 

And we have to work on that. But this is one program, and we have hundreds of these programs. 

You've got great arts institutions in America. Lincoln Center is here, and others are here. 

Right. 

But-- a place that does a lot of the same things that the Kennedy Center does. You know, what should Kennedy Center represent? Should it be the-- identified as the nation's cultural center? 

It should be and it will be. And what that requires us to do more of is to produce some more unique art at the Kennedy Center. Last autumn, the Kennedy Center hosted a Balanchine festival, which brought performers from around the world to perform-- 

And made people in New York-- --very jealous. 

That's the kind of programming that makes you the national center, and that's the kind of programming that we'll be doing more of in the future. 

And so why -- A -- haven't you been doing more of that? And what does it take to do more of it in the future? 

Takes a lot of planning, and it takes a good amount of fund-raising. And those are the two areas that I like to work in. 

OK, but I mean-- but what does that say? Does that say that the reason the Kennedy Center hasn't achieved its potential is because of planning and fund-raising, rather than the inspiration of artists? 

I hate to say it hasn't achieved its potential because again, you're on this continuum. It's only 30 years old. 

Right. 

And you're constantly trying to do more and-- 

Fair enough, but-- 

--better. 

But you've just said that it ought to be better 

Absolutely. 

--arts institution. 

I would say that has more to do with marketing than with programming. And the truth of the matter is that arts organizations don't know how to market themselves very well. That is not just the Kennedy Center. That is throughout the country and throughout the world. Arts institutions, because they're under such pressure to sell their tickets, have spent so much time focusing on how do you market an individual performance of Giselle or of Tosca or an individual symphonic performance and have spent much too little time worrying about how do you sell your whole institution. And one of the things I've tried to do when I've run each of the organizations you mentioned before was to try and develop the institutional profile. When I got to the Alvin Ailey company and Alex Haley died, I received many, many letters of condolence because the population thought that Alex Haley and Alvin Ailey were the same person. 

Yes! 

I don't think they'd make that same mistake today because-- identity to-- To the Alvin Ailey company. 

--the Alvin Ailey company. 

And that's something that we have to do. When you go to London, you go to the Royal Shakespeare Company, whether they're doing Coriolanus or Macbeth, you go to the Royal Shakespeare Company because you want to see the Royal Shakespeare Company. And one's aim when one runs any arts organization is to create that level of institutional identity. 

And you do that by? 

You do that with PR. You do that with very special events. You do that by constantly pushing what you're doing into the public consciousness. And you do it in a very, very organized fashion. 

But-- and how much of your role -- you role -- is it to be a creative force in terms of bringing the most talented people-- and I mean by this directors and conductors and-- and those kinds of people to the institution? Is that your job, too? 

In part, yes. Absolutely. I have a wonderful staff that works with me, wonderful artistic advisers-- Leonard Slatkin, who's the great music director of the National Symphony Orchestra-- --and Placido Domingo at the Washington Opera and Suzanne Farrell, who is building a ballet company at the Kennedy Center. These are wonderful artistic minds with whom I've very, very honored to collaborate. But yes, my job is to think about artistic ventures, but it's also been to find the resources to pay for those ventures. 

There is always the argument -- and Kennedy Center's gone through this -- that perhaps the-- there is at Lincoln Center and lots of other places, at the ABT and places like that-- a lot of people who are doing traditional culture at the highest level. 

Right. 

What the Kennedy Center ought to be about is the highest level of experimentation. 

I think-- 

Peter Sellers, et cetera, et cetera. 

Sure. I think it has to be about both. And I think if you're going to be the national center, you've an obligation to showcase the greatest work. That work might be more traditional, as you're suggesting, but it also has to be some more experimental work. Right now, we have an AmericArtes festival that's showcasing very, very contemporary Latin American art. You won't see that in most other places in this country or in this world. It's a wonderful festival at the Kennedy Center. So I agree with you, we have an obligation to showcase the very, very cutting-edge work. But we don't do our job if that's all we show because we have a population in the Washington area that also has a right to see the more traditional work, as well. 

And every place they do. 

And every place. 

I mean, there has to be some way to find a combination of those kind of things, and that's why-- that's why you have off-Broadway and Broadway. 

But I think New York's a bad example because there is so much art in New York that various arts institutions can specialize. The Brooklyn Academy of Music can be very different from Lincoln Center. 

Exactly. Exactly. 

In most other cities, you don't have that proliferation of the arts, so that the leading center has to play several roles at once. 

Does-- is somewhere in the back of your head, not at the top of your agenda, this notion that this unachievable dream of having a national theater can be achieved? 

I think it's hard to have a national theater in a country that is as spread out geographically as we are. 

With all the regional theaters and-- 

With all the regional theaters. I mean, who's to say that anyone's going to start a new theater that is the national theater? It is different from the European countries, where the capitals-- 

Right. 

--tend to house the national theaters. And I'm tremendously excited by the proliferation of regional arts in this country. And as the head of the Kennedy Center, I feel an obligation to work with regional arts organizations and bring the best of the regional arts to the Kennedy Center, as well. 

And also give them an opportunity to have the best of the Kennedy Center come to their places-- 

That's it. 

--as you're doing with Leonard Slatkin and-- 

That's correct. In Oklahoma. That's correct. Absolutely. 

Yeah. What scares you the most about this assignment? 

Well, you're-- you're always scared on two fronts. You always want to make sure that the art you're doing is wonderful and great, and you're always afraid that you're not going to be able to pay for it. So there's lots of reasons to be fearful. And-- 

And if you do bad today, you're not going to be able to pay for the next one that comes around because you will have lost some public support. 

That's exactly right. So-- 

Or private support. 

So I spend my life in fear. 

And do you, when you go to the opera, sit there in your privileged chair, look up and say, ``Ah! 

No. What I say is-- what I hope to do-- for a great performance, I sit back and just enjoy it. 

Do you really? I mean-- 

When it's not a great performance, I sit back and think about all the things I'd change. 

I mean, you-- now, no regrets? In other words, you sort of think that, ``Look, things turned out the way they were meant to be. I was-- I have a unique talent for this, and I'd rather be the best institutional leader than just a''-- 

I'd go further. I'd say-- 

--``average singer.'' the stage. Is it really? 

Absolutely. I'm developing a artistic program. I'm developing a marketing program. I'm developing a fund-raising program. It's a very creative field and one that not enough people think about entering. 

And you have all that power. 

It's really not so much about power. It's more about-- about inspiration and the ability to collaborate with so many great people. I mean, if you think about the people I work with -- Judith Jamison and Bernard Haitink in London and now Leonard Slatkin and Placido and Valery Gergiev. I've worked with all these people. Who gets that chance? 

That's a good point. America and-- somebody once said to me about my show-- I think it was my friend, Larry King, once said to me, he said, ``You know, you like to have that ballet and opera stars on that show. We don't do much of that.'' I mean, as if somehow that there wasn't an-- not he thought this, but just the notion that somehow there wasn't a widespread curiosity about ballet and opera and symphonic music and-- 

And I would argue with that. If you look at the numbers, there are just huge numbers of people coming to each of those art forms you just mentioned. I think what is tragic is that we're not introducing in the public school system these art forms as much as we did when I was growing up. And I think the arts organizations have a responsibility now to fill that void. 

It is a real problem, isn't it. I mean, there is no sense of outreach to introduce at the youngest level. 

There is now on the part of the arts organizations, but there isn't on the part of the school systems of most countries-- most counties in this country. 

When you look at the Kennedy Center, you know, and-- what's-- how do you-- how do you make the balance between all the various arts, in terms of budget, in terms of commitment, in terms of-- 

It is somewhat arbitrary. One sits and you look at a year and say, ``How much of each art form can we get that is wonderful? How much of each art form can we get that we can afford? How do we schedule it so that different-- similar attractions don't compete with each other?'' It's a very, very large balancing act, and there's a large staff that worries about the scheduling and the programming of our attractions for that very reason. 

You have turned around places, as we've mentioned. Covent Garden is one. 

Right. 

Is this a turnaround at Kennedy Center, or something else? 

No. No, it's different. I feel like I've spent the last 15 years working with troubled 

Yeah, I was going to say! 

--and the reason why I've done that is to learn what makes a healthy organization. 

Well, I mean, you almost say, ``Well, gee, if he's coming to the Kennedy Center, we must be in trouble because that's the only places he goes.'' 

No, it's absolutely not a turnaround. I now feel like I know how to make a healthy organization, so I hope to take the Kennedy Center to new heights, but it's certainly building on a very strong base. But those that were troubled, what-- was there a common problem that they had, or-- Absolutely. 

It was? 

Absolutely. What happens in so many arts organizations-- and by the way, not-for-profit organizations, not just arts organizations -- is that when you hit a financial bump, the inclination of the staff and the board is always to cut back. And where it's easiest to cut back is on new artistic ventures and on marketing because you don't have to fire anyone to do that. You'll do one old production versus a new one, or you'll spend a little less on advertising. Well, if you think about it, the very things that bring you an audience and patrons are artistic initiative and marketing. So, when you start cutting back on that, you're creating a vicious spiral. You cut back, you have less money. You cut back more, you have less money. And you get into this very, very situation. And the trick to a turnaround is very simple -- marshal all the resources you have, put it into great art and marketing that art. And you'll get a little bit more money and you put it back into art and marketing and you have more money. And that's how I turned around Ailey. That's how we turned around ABT and the Royal Opera House. 

You've just made lots of marketing and advertising and promotional people very happy. 

But the art has to be good. There's no point in the not-for-profit world to try and promote bad art. So the reason you do this is not the marketing, the reason you do this is the good art. But the marketing is required to get the resources to continue to produce good art consistently. 

You don't-- I mean, I assume-- I know there are courses and I know there are places you can go to study art's management. 

Right. 

But I assume you had to-- this is on the job training. I mean, you didn't-- 

It's a relatively young field and it's been taught in university for maybe 20 years. 

Like hotel management or something. 

So much of this I have learned on the job. And the reason to start the Vilar Institute of Arts Management is exactly this. 

Oh, that's what some of this money is going for? 

That's what the vast majority is going for. 

So this $50 million is to do what? 

To do two things. One is to bring the Kirov Opera and Ballet to the Kennedy Center every year for the next 10 years. 

Because he likes the Kirov? 

Because I like the Kirov. He happens to like the Kirov too, but I wouldn't do it just to please the donor. 

You wouldn't? 

Of course not. Of course not. 

Suppose I came to you and said I want to give -- and this is obviously not going to happen -- but I want to give $50 million to the Kennedy Center. And I want part of that money to bring-- let's choose somebody good -- the Paris Opera, to the Kennedy Center every year. I happen to be, as the donor, in love with the Paris Opera, which happens to be run by an American. What would you say? What that be a problem for you? 

It would be a problem for me if I didn't feel that the Paris Opera deserved that kind of showcase at the Kennedy Center and I wouldn't take the money. 

You'd have to feel that it deserved-- that the-- let's take the Paris Opera, deserved that kind of showcase? 

Correct. In a real situation, let's take the Kirov because this is a true situation. I believe the Kirov is producing some of the great opera and the great ballet in the world today. And I do believe it does deserve that kind of showcase every year in this country. And so I am thrilled to bring Valery Gergiev and the Kirov every year to the Kennedy Center. This was my idea. I went to Alberto Vilar with that proposal; he didn't come to me. 

I see. So did he have a special love for the Kirov? Or he just happened to like them? 

It is one of the organizations that he supports. But he supports so many that I had a lot to choose from if that was the only reason I was going after an organization. 

OK, but then here's a question -- were you going to choose one of his for sure? That you knew he had some interest in or he'd given something to? 

Absolutely not. The Kirov, for instance, I had them for eight weeks at Covent Garden last summer. So-- and that was not supported by Mr. Vilar. So I have a commitment and a relationship to that organization that goes certainly beyond any one patron. So that's what some of the money is for. But the majority of the money is to start an institute-- an arts management institute. We're going to be an on the job training-- 

The Kennedy School of Arts Management? 

The Vilar Institute for Arts Management at the Kennedy Center. And we're going to have an on the job training to train young entrepreneurial arts managers. Give them classroom training and practical. 

And so you'll be Professor Kaiser? 

And I've taught at NYU for six years, so it feels natural. 

Back to sort of the arts discussion. Other than the Kirov, what would qualify in your head for things that you think deserve more attention in America, around the world, whether it's Japan or China or Latin America, Europe? 

Well, there's so many great artists. I mean it's hard-- how do I pick one or two. But I think that what I would love to see at the Kennedy Center is some more serious theater, some great theater. Perhaps theater that we produce ourselves. I'd love to see some attention to song. I think we don't spend a lot of time thinking about song in most of our arts institutions today -- the art song. And there are some-- there happen to be at this point in time a whole host of great American singers -- Renee Fleming, Susan Graham, Dawn Upshaw, Tom Hampson -- who are absolute leading proponents of song. We'd love to have more of that at the Kennedy Center. So there's a whole lot to be done. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thank you very much. 

A pleasure to meet you. Michael Kaiser of the Kennedy Center. We'll be right back. Stay with us. PETER EDELMAN has devoted his life to the plight of the poverty-stricken. He began working as an advocate and policy maker alongside Robert Kennedy. After Senator Kennedy's death, he continued his work as a personal memorial to his mentor and friend. He went on to serve under President Clinton as the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the Human Health Services. In 1996, the president signed the new welfare bill into law. PETER EDELMAN resigned in protest, believing the bill ended a 60-year commitment to poor children. In this book, Searching for America's Heart, Edelman proposes an optimistic new idea for reform combining national and local activism. I'm pleased to have him on this program. Welcome. Good to have you here. 

I'm so glad to be here. 

There's a lot to talk about, but let me just take this relationship with Robert Kennedy. What was it about him and his commitment that so infused you to continue in that mission rather than going off to do something different? 

Well, it was so real. It was so every day, all day. He cared so much about people who had less, and especially children in our country. And I had the chance to kind of go to school along with him. He was way ahead of me, but we went around the country. We went to Mississippi. We went to Indian reservations. We went to Appalachia. And I learned firsthand about poverty and got that commitment that he had to really make a difference. He just needed to do something every day to make a difference. That was his creed. 

Because of his own life experiences until he was an adult, until he was attorney general, he never really grasped the impact of poverty in America, as he didn't really grasp the impact of racism of America. It was a profound adult experience for him. 

Yes, yes. There was something there all the time. And Evan Thomas's book talks about his childhood and it's a little bit of psychological theory, but-- 

Being the youngest, what impact it had. Not the youngest, but the smallest. 

And being away at school in the '30s and his father was in England and feeling neglected, whether that's true or not. But it's certainly true that when he became attorney general, the very first thing that he did was to install his high school friend David Hackett in a little office right next to his big office and say, ``You work on juvenile delinquency.'' And they recruited people from all over the government and people from outside. And, of course, that turned into working on poverty. And he went himself, the way he always learned, while Bay of Pigs was going on, all the of the early testing from Krushchev and everything. In 1961, Robert Kennedy goes to Harlem and he meets with groups of young people separately, black and Italian -- young men -- to hear from them what they're concerned about, why they think they're not making it and getting opportunities in the society. That was the way he always learned. 

If he had lived and if he had become president, what do you think he might have done? 

He was deeply committed to healing the racial divisions in our society. And he understood as no one else did who was an elected official, the connections between race and poverty. And he had a very deep commitment to empowering people in their communities to tackle the problems in neighborhoods and to get jobs for people and to have federal policy that would really have the federal money go straight on down to the neighborhoods and get to people there. And, of course, that was what his idea was in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which was one of the early community development corporations in the country. So he would have-- of course he would have worked on-- I think he would have ended the war in Vietnam much, much sooner, saved probably millions of lives. But in our country, he would have worked on healing most divisions. 

Many will argue even today that the principle victim of the war in Vietnam was a great society. 

Absolutely true. Lyndon Johnson was committed to doing something about poverty. And I-- just as he was probably more committed than any president in our history to civil rights, what he did in terms of the civil rights act of '64 and the voting rights act. But it just ran out of gas. There was the money there. 

And then here comes Bill Clinton. Let me make one point here. In-- when you went down to Mississippi with Senator Kennedy -- or was it Attorney General Kennedy? I guess, senator? 

Senator. Senator, yeah. 

When you went down there, you met Marian Wright. 

That's true. 

An African-American woman who had gone to Yale Law School and knew-- did you know her before that? 

No. No, no. 

You met her in Mississippi? 

No, I mean, I met her because of Robert Kennedy, because of the wonderful good fortune of going down there -- if I can say this -- going down there and seeing starving children. And of course he was deeply committed to coming back and doing something about that. And that work led to the food stamp program and to really doing something about hunger in America. But what I got out of it-- 

Was a wife. 

Yep. 

And now three great kids, right? 

Yeah, that's right. Thank you. 

And she has been the great head of the Children's Defense Fund. And Hillary Clinton sat on the board of that and they were chairs as well. 

Yeah. 

President William Jefferson Clinton, 1992, comes to office. You go to HHS. 

I did. 

What happened and what is it that you feel was a -- I don't want to use the word ``betrayal, '' but was a, in a sense, what? Characterize it for me. 

Well, it wasn't a portrayal in a personal sense. I think-- 

I'm not talking about you personally. I really mean in terms of poor children. 

I think it turns out that, and we've seen this in other things that have happened, sad to say, that he's very interested in his own survival. He's interested in himself. And it came to be 1996 and he was running for re-election and the Republicans decided after they had been unwilling to give him a welfare bill that he would sign, they gave him a couple that were so far to the right that he couldn't do it, wouldn't do it. And so they put in front of him a welfare bill that essentially destroyed the idea that anybody had a right to get help. 

After two years you were-- had to go to work. But the big thing is you could only five years of assistance for the whole life of bringing up your children, the whole time of no matter how many children you had, two or three. So over an 18, 20 year period, only five years of assistance. And even more important, or equally important, that the states could have whatever policy they wanted; didn't have to help anybody. And we've seen the results of that. And he was advised, Charlie, by Leon Panetta, George Stephanopolous, Harold Ickes -- close political advisers, not Dick Morris, who advised him the other way. Right I understand that. 

Who advised him to sign the bill. 

Dick Morris said, ``You won't get re-elected if you don't sign this.'' 

His political advisers -- these three that I ``You should veto it.'' And he went ahead and decided-- they said he could survive politically. He said, in effect, ``I don't even want this. I don't even want to take the chance that this will become an issue, so I'm going to sign it.'' And I think that was just really a very bad thing to do. 

And so, seven days later you resigned. 

I resigned, yes, a couple of weeks later. And I think I did the right thing. 

Resignations on principle are rare in American public life. 

It's-- it's not something that's in our tradition. 

Cy Vance did it, I think. 

Cy Vance, although he didn't say so at the time, but he did. And there were three admirable diplomats over the Bosnia issue, you remember, early in the Clinton administration. There certainly have been examples. In the case of Watergate, you remember. 

But here's one which there were all kinds of relationships. I mean, Hillary Clinton. 

Yes. 

Marian Wright-Edelman. 

Yes. 

You. I mean, there was a connection. There was a sense that you had great hope for this president. 

Well, I had great hope for this president. And by that time, I'd been quite disappointed. And in any case, this thing was such a break with 60 years of policy. Now, the welfare system that we had needed to be fixed. It wasn't good. It wasn't helping people get out of poverty. 

Pat Moynihan says the mistake of Bill Clinton was to take on health care before he took on welfare reform; that welfare reform would have been a better first effort. 

I don't agree with that. I think health care reform was for all American people, you know. We had 40-- at that time, 37 million, now it's 42 million people without health care. And I think that was-- meant more to more people and was more of a mandate for him when he was elected. So I don't agree with Senator Moynihan about that. But what I do think is that what he went ahead and did here was just such a break with where we had-- so devastating to too many children in this country. And I just couldn't abide that. 

Just as a moment of history, were you allowed the opportunity to make this case in person with all the passion that you could bring to the subject and with all the calling into the memory of Robert Kennedy, et cetera? 

I was a part of a group at HHS working with Donna Shalala. So for me and Wendell Primus and Mary Jo Bane, who resigned along with me, she was our spokesperson. 

So you made the argument to the secretary and she made the argument to the president? 

Oh, she certainly did. She tried very hard. There was a climactic meeting at the end of July 1996 where she and Bob Rubin and Henry Cisneros and Bob Reich and the three political advisers that I mentioned and the vice president and others were in the group. 

All made what argument? Did they just-- were there? Did Bob Rubin oppose it? 

Yes, Bob Rubin opposed it. 

Did the vice president oppose it? 

No, the vice president urged him to sign the bill. But you had four cabinet members -- Mickey Kantor was there, urged him to to sign the bill. But the majority of people in the room-- 

Former chairman of the campaign. 

Yes. The majority of people in the room, senior advisers, urged him to veto the legislation. And his answer, which I can only attribute to-- I mean, you know, politicians make political calculations, I understand that. I don't think this was a close call in his mind; that he was gravely threatened and therefore he had to do this. The cloud hadn't come up over the horizon yet. 

Wait a minute. I mean, I think he would disagree with that, Peter. I mean, I think he would clearly say to you, I don't think I could have gotten re-elected. Because Dick Morris, who he was believing at that time, was saying that very thing -- you cannot be re-elected if you don't sign this bill. 

Charlie, that's why it's so important to know, and I've talked to Harold Ickes about this, to know that Harold Ickes and George Stephanopolous and Leon Panetta said you can be re-elected. That's so important. Yes, Bob Rubin maybe doesn't know about whether somebody can or can't be re-elected, but these are his political advisers, some of his political advisers who said you will benefit because you will have stood up on principle and you 

Yeah, but Dick Morris had rescued him when he was down before and so he had more confidence in Dick Morris at this time. 

Maybe so. 

Probably. 

Maybe so. But it was a terrible thing to do. 

Let me take you to today. It's unacceptable in America that we have, what, 30 percent of people, what -- living-- what's the poverty consequence in America? 

Well, we have 30-plus million people that would be classified as poor, although I think if you measure it by what it really costs anybody to live-- you know, the poverty line is about $14,000 for a family of three. Who can get by on $14,000 in any major city in this country? I mean, maybe in some small town. And so 30 million probably-- 30 percent probably is the right number in terms of what it really costs to live and the struggles that people are having to make it. And it's why I'm so troubled about this tax cut that we're hearing about that, you know, you have 27 percent of people who are working who aren't paying any taxes-- any income taxes now. They are paying payroll taxes. They're getting no benefit out of this tax cut as it's proposed. This is wrong. 

You know what's interesting? I just saw the Wall Street Journal, I think, Bill Gates's father, I think Warren Buffett and a series of very wealthy people are saying don't eliminate the estate tax to provide a benefit to our heirs because if you do, you will be eliminating a huge amount of revenue coming in to the federal government which ought to be there so that other people don't have to bear the burden of that kind of taxation. 

It's a revenue loss and I think it's going to play havoc with something that's very important, that President Bush ought to think is very important -- which is charitable giving to support the kinds of organizations, whether it's symphonies or museums or libraries or the faith-based organizations that President Bush says are so important to help individuals. This idea of ending the estate tax is really inconsistent with other parts of what Bush says he wants to do. 

So what should we do? What should we do about poverty in America? And what should we do about the worldwide consequences of too many people in a world in which there is enormous prosperity are living on $2 a day. 

Yes. Well, we need to do vastly more, along with all of the wealthy countries in the world who are doing a better job in terms of the percent of their gross national product they spend on helping less advantaged nations, vastly more there to try to bring development, to try to bring better health and everything. And in our country, I think, number one, we need to recognize that we-- our pretension, our ideal, is that we are one country, that everybody who's here is a part of this country. We've turned into two countries. And so wherever you want to break it, whether it's poverty or it's near-poverty, which is where I think the line is, we need to be saying, If you are working, you should get an income, and everything that goes with that in terms of health care and child care, that's enough for you to survive on. And we should be magnanimous enough and have enough heart to say that if you're not in a position to work, we're going to provide protection for your children, because the way they-- the only way they can grow up and make it is if they have a chance through their childhood. And to get good education, we need to fix the public schools in this country. The fundamental point that I make in this book is that it is not just about national policy. And I have a whole long list of things that we ought to do in 

So, in other words, it's not just about how you come down in terms of the role of government and-- in these issues. 

It is certainly not only about the role of 

So it's not just about-- --ideology or, in fact-- 

It's about us. It's about our responsibility, it's about-- It's also, of course, that people need to take responsibility for themselves. 

Yes. 

--Robert Kennedy stood for that was very important. 

Accountability. 

Accountability, that we do all have to be responsible and accountable. That's a part of what the kind of welfare reform that we should have had. But that we have a community responsibility to help, that that's part of the answer. We're not going to get the public schools that we want in this country unless in every community, we really all participate in improving those schools for our children, or a system of child care or jobs in the regional economy-- all of these things require people to make an effort at the community level, as well as volunteer on an individual basis. And there are millions of people who are already volunteering, but we need more of that. 

A lot of your conservative critics would say, PETER EDELMAN is blind to the cycle of dependence, and especially in terms of welfare, and that if it became, notwithstanding there were some people whose life would have been much worse except for it. On the other hand, there were lots of people, in a sense, who were dependent on it and who had become, you know, living testimony to the failure. 

Yes. We had-- it was a failed policy. We had too many people on welfare. We had too many people on welfare because we were not seriously helping people to get jobs, we were not seriously doing what was necessary to help their children at the same time, to make sure that the children would be protected. It was, it was a lousy policy. Dependence is not a good idea. But the answer is not to say to people, bumper sticker, We're going to just kick you off. 

Yes. 

And the thing that troubles me so much about this, we have a lot of people who've gotten jobs as a result 

Shock therapy, so to speak. 

Shock therapy, that's right. We have a lot of people who have gotten jobs, but they're not getting out of poverty. More importantly, we have at least 3 million people right now, as a result of this policy, all around the country who neither have a job nor have cash assistance. And that includes over 2 million children. And they're worse off. The census numbers show that they're worse off. And I just think that's wrong. We could have done it right, and we didn't. 

And you know what's amazing to me? Regardless of where you come down on some of these ideological debates and to me, is that the consequences for a child's life, if poverty means malnutrition, if poverty means the inability to be available to get on the train that America promise offers-- 

Yes. 

--because of poverty, because of the absence of opportunity, because of the fact that poverty and malnutrition and a lot of other things like that, impede your ability to be educated. 

Yes. 

And a lot of other things. This book is called Searching for America's Heart: RFK and the Renewal of Hope, with this rather extraordinary picture of Peter and-- is that in Mississippi, or where is that? 

That's actually-- 

Is that in 

-- in California, with-- when we went to see Cesar Chavez. We're each wearing a Huelga-- a strike great strike button. 

OK. Great to have you, thank you. 

Thank you so much. 

He was the Great Emancipator, she was the daughter of a slave owner. Together they lived, loved, and struggled through personal tragedies, a brutal war, and a heartbreaking descent into madness. 

She was a gentle lady, and he was just one step up from a rube. She had position in society and he didn't. He was still a wannabe. 

Despite their differences, they share a powerful political ambition. 

It's no accident that she fell in love with Abraham Lincoln. She sensed both his ambitions and his capacity to realize those ambitions, of which she would be a part. 

Abraham Lincoln is one of the most revered presidents in our nation's history, if not the most revered. In Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided, filmmaker DAVID GRUBIN explores the personal side of the couple, Mary Todd Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln. Their story is set against the backdrop of the Civil War. The three-part series is the first dual biography of the couple, and here is a look at a clip from the series. 

That evening, the Lincolns attended Ford's Theater with a young major named Henry Rathbone and his fiancee, Clara Harris. The play was a knockabout farce called Our American Cousin. 

--you 

The president seemed to enjoy it. Mary nestled against her husband. 

What will Miss Harris think of my hanging onto you so? 

She won't think anything about it. 

As Lincoln fell forward, Mary screamed. John Wilkes Booth had shot the president of the United States. 

DAVID GRUBIN is the producer and director of this documentary, and I'm pleased to have him back. As you know, he was recently here talking about Napoleon, and now Abraham Lincoln. Based on my conversation with him, Abraham Lincoln is one of his favorite subjects. Welcome to the program. 

Good to be here, Charlie. 

Abraham Lincoln, but this is more than Abraham Lincoln, it's about a relationship. Tell me why you took it there. 

Yes. I think if you want to really understand a man, you ought to understand the woman that he loves, or understand his wife. And Abraham and Mary Lincoln were a close couple. They were married for 23 years. It was a turbulent marriage, but I think it was also a loving marriage. People don't know that. And what they know about Mary is-- if they know anything-- is they think of her as a kind of a crazy lady. So it was also a chance to get close to Mary and to-- hopefully to paint a sympathetic portrait of a woman who suffered tremendous sorrows. 

At the soldier's home, at a clairvoyant's house in Georgetown, even in the White House, Mary attended sÃ©ances. Lincoln himself sat in on at least one. Seances, he said, reminded him of cabinet meetings. The spirits, like members of his cabinet, gave contradictory advice. But he felt that charlatans were exploiting his wife's grief. Mary's behavior continued to alarm him. One evening at the White House, Elizabeth Keckley remembered, Lincoln steered Mary to a window and pointed to a distant building, an asylum. 

``Mother, do you see that large white building on that hill yonder? Try and control your grief, or it will drive you mad. And we may have to send you there.'' 

Mary struggled to regain her equilibrium, for Lincoln's sake if not her own. 

There is the impression, as you say, that she was erratic, different, the kind of words that might not be appropriate, but be truthful too. What was she like? I mean, why-- what kind of influence did she have on him? 

What people don't understand is that when Abraham Lincoln meets Mary Todd, she's the catch-- 

Yes. 

--he's not the catch, she's very well connected. She's fascinated by politics. She's smart, she's well educated, very different from other women of her time, speaks in an-- with an impeccable French accent if she wants to. And they share a keen political ambition. And he's a kind of a backwoods guy who's coming to Springfield, meeting this woman, surrounded by beaux. And he falls in love with her. And she sees something in him. She sees the possibilities in this fellow. 

She was as ambitious for him as he was ambitious for himself. 

They share a keen political ambition. 

They go to the White House. Did she like Washington? Did she fit in in Washington? 

Well, she hit Washington like fireworks. She was excited to be there, she wanted to be the first lady. In fact, the term ``first lady,'' it was first used to apply to Mary Lincoln. The term hadn't been used before. So she hoped to shine. The sad thing is that she is a Southerner, and her brothers are fighting for the Confederacy. Rumors start to spread that she's a Confederate spy. She can't-- she wants to redecorate the White House, make it a special place. But this is a war, it's not a time to be spending that kind of money. So everything she tries to do really falls flat. And it's a terrible time for her. Then, you know, she loses Willy, they lose their son in the White House. And then they-- 

Son that Abraham Lincoln-- 

--had to go back-- 

--loved so much. 

It's really their favorite. And after that, everything just goes black for her. 

That's when she becomes strange. 

I think she's so traumatized by it. She's already lost a son, and now this is the second son. And this is such a terrible thing for her. What is amazing to me is that it's just as terrible for Abraham Lincoln. He experiences terrible grief too. And remember, he was given to depression. He came quite-- twice close to suicide in his life. But he, unlike Mary-- Mary reacts like most of us. I mean, what could be worse than losing a child, two children? And Abraham Lincoln is able to identify with the suffering of Americans all over the country. Because this is a civil war, everybody is losing children, and he's able to articulate the suffering and the grief of everyone. 

And then comes the assassination. 

Well, he's sitting there next to Mary Todd Lincoln. The war's over, they've just had a wonderful carriage ride together in which they're hoping to have a new, a new life together. They've grown apart during the war. 

Because he was fighting the war all the time 

He has no time for her. And as she nestles by his side, she-- he is shot. And this is another trauma that-- I mean, how-- what-- how can you-- but-- be anything but sympathetic to this woman, who's lost two children, now her husband is assassinated as he holds her hand? And then, for most Americans, her story is gone. But in fact, we continue the story in the film, and you see the traumas that continue to beset her. 

She didn't leave the room for how long after his assassination? 

Well, she couldn't go to his funeral. She stayed for weeks in the White House before she could even leave, and finally was able to get back to Chicago, and then drifted from hotel to hotel. 

And how did she finally end up? 

Well, you know, she loses her next son. And that really does traumatize her so deeply that her-- the one son that remains, Robert, puts her into an institution. It's a terrible moment, because she doesn't get a fair trial. She's put away. But it is a calming experience for her. And I think she does find some relief when she comes back, some. But she never-- her grief never, never lets up. It's a, it's a, it's a tragic, tragic tale. I think of Mary Lincoln as-- she's like most of us. I mean, we wouldn't be able to survive these things very well. Somehow Abraham Lincoln survived these sorrows, survived this kind of-- the suffering that he endured and gave meaning to the suffering of all Americans, with the language that he found in the Gettysburg Address for the second inaugural, a kind of political poetry that expressed the sorrows of all Americans and gave it higher meaning. 

I hear all the parts about Mary Todd Lincoln that make her a kind of dual subject matter here. Tell me what you learned about Abraham Lincoln, this man, considered, as we said earlier, certainly among our two or three best presidents, if not our greatest. 

He's endlessly fascinating, because you feel the real human being, the real person there, and you can get close to him in a way that you can't with somebody like George Washington, perhaps. And what is it? What is it that makes him so special? Is it his sense of humor, that he knows how to make people laugh and he knows how to use his humor? Is it his extraordinary capacity for empathy that he has, that he could feel what everyone else was feeling, and articulate it, find words for it? Or is it just his sense of himself? I mean, Abraham Lincoln knew who he was, and it's so refreshing to see a man who seems shrewd. I saw his frailties, I saw his vulnerabilities, but the-- he became for me less like a god, less like the man up on the Lincoln Memorial, and more like a man. And the more that I saw that, the more that I came to be drawn to him. 

DAVID GRUBIN, thank you very much. This series, another in a series of incredible documentaries by DAVID GRUBIN, begins airing on PBS stations on February 19 at 9p.m. Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
