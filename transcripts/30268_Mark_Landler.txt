Good evening everybody. I'm John Hockenberry filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with a look at President Trump's meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It was their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office. In the past, Trump has been critical of Merkel's leadership. He has said that Germany has made a catastrophic mistake in welcoming more than a million migrants and refugees in recent years. During today's summit, Trump expressed his strong support for NATO, but emphasized that member nations must pay what they owe to support the alliance. Mark Landler of "The New York Times" joins me now from Washington. Welcome. 

Good to be here, John. 

So, Mark, would you say that this is a test of the relationship between Merkel and Trump? It seems to me, always, when I look at the body language of Angela Merkel that, she, from the beginning, has not known what to make of this man. Is that settling down? Is there more of a clarity here? 

Well, I think, John, that Angela Merkel is someone who is used to dealing with mercurial sort of testosterone-style men if you will. She's dealt with Vladimir Putin in Russia, Berlusconi in Italy, Xi Jinping in China, Erdogan in Turkey, and now she's dealing with Donald Trump in the United States. The U.S. is such a major trading partner and ally of the U.S. that Merkel has to figure out how to work with the new American President. And I think that's what you saw today. Whatever she may make of him -- and it would be wonderful to know what her inside thoughts or interior thoughts are -- she was going to make this relationship work. She came to Washington to try to find some common ground, and I think the news conference they held together was an illustration of two people who are literally poles apart on some of these crucial issues, but at least from her perspective, trying very hard to find a way to work together. 

I got the sense that she expressed subtly, if you will, to Donald Trump that she'll take care of this part of the relationship and he can take care of this part of the relationship. That she kind of set out domains that she thought Germany was going to be better to handle and that other aspects of the migrant crisis that Trump could deal with on his own, and that that would build into a kind of bifurcated relationship that might function very well. 

Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, I think what she made a point of saying is that she is the leader of Germany, will look after German national interest. She described her response to the migrant crisis that's obviously very different than what President Trump is talking about, but one that she thinks is suited to German interests. And likewise on trade, which is the other major bone of contention between the two of them. She said, look, I'm also here to lobby for and push German interests, and she turned to him at one point and said, A trade deal is only worth doing if both sides win. So I think you're right. She was saying I will play my corner of the court and you play yours, and that way we'll be able to coexist, and perhaps even work together. 

Since before the end of the Cold War, and Merkel was a leader early on in understanding how these forces work, demographics have been a real warning sign in Germany that the workforce needs to grow, it needs to grow somehow. The birthrate needs to rise, it isn't rising. Part of the impetus for migrants to come into Germany is to add to the workforce. It's not an argument that Donald Trump really has much context with. He doesn't think about immigration in those terms. Is it possible that Merkel expressed to him, look, here's another way of looking at it, and a lot of these nations really need to think about bring workers in because it's helpful for them for the precise reasons that we want trade to work. 

Well, you know, people always say that Donald Trump is surprisingly receptive to the arguments of people he meets. That said, I mean, the United States, as you say, is blessed with very different demographics than Germany or other western European countries. It's got a younger population, more young people. So that argument simply isn't particularly applicable to the United States. We have other very valid reasons and historical reasons for being open to immigrants. But replenishing the workforce and creating new younger citizens is not one of them. So I don't actually think that that argument probably makes much of an influence on him. I wonder whether it's more on the trade side, where today the two talked about German companies and the role in apprenticing and training young workers. That might be an area where Chancellor Merkel can actually present Donald Trump some ideas that will make an impact. And that's actually the subject that they discussed after the news conference when they went back into the White House for lunch. 

What do you think the urgency is for Angela Merkel to figure out exactly what Donald Trump's relationship or intentions are with Vladimir Putin right now? 

Well Angela Merkel has always been the leader in the West who has kind of served as the bridge to Vladimir Putin. She understands him perhaps better than any other leader in the West. She's certainly met him more perhaps than any other leader in the West, and so I think it's vitally important for her to figure out what kind of relationship Donald Trump is seeking. And that's not an easy question to answer in the current environment, because while President Trump came into office calling for a new kind of relationship and a reset with Russia, in recent days, and I think it's, in part, because of the continuing questions around the Trump campaign's ties to the Russians during the election, you've seen the administration actually stake out a much more traditional position. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, was quoted as saying we can never trust Russia. So we're in a bit of a fluid moment where you had a president who wanted to change the relationship but perhaps is finding out he has very little room to maneuver to do that, and may, indeed, end up with a relationship that's much closer to the one the Obama Administration had and hence to what chancellor Merkel herself would be comfortable with. 

And would Chancellor Merkel be in a position to say, look, bear down on this if you like, but this isn't going to fly, these things, this never trust Russia. And we have a problem in Ukraine and we need to decide together how we're going to deal with it. That's the priority. 

Yeah, I think probably what she'll really try to do is say, look, I know Vladimir Putin better than anyone. I've been working this issue now for years. The whole Minsk process, this diplomatic process to try to resolve the situation in Ukraine is something the Germans have really spearheaded. And, you know, the American administration said last week to reporters, in advance of this meeting, that Donald Trump would be interested and curious about Chancellor Merkel's take on Vladimir Putin. Remember, for all his talk about Putin, he doesn't actually know Putin at all. So I think he's probably going to ask her, quiz her a little bit about how best to deal with the Russian leader. And perhaps, as I said earlier, she could make an impact on him. He has a penchant for listening to people and taking some of their ideas to heart when they make a persuasive case. 

Did you get any sense of the friendliness of them, the ways in which -- I mean it's so different to see how they address the reporters at a meeting like this? 

Well, to be honest, I thought it was, as I have thought to myself, sort of meticulously formal, very impersonal. There was no chemistry that I could really detect. But to be fair, Chancellor Merkel is a brainy intellectual. She's not a warm person. Even President Obama, with whom she had arguably the best relationship that President Obama had with a foreign leader, there wasn't a whole lot of sentimentality of, you know, putting their arms around each other. She's not like that. You'll remember that famous episode years and years ago where President Bush put his hands on her shoulders, and she sort of recoiled. She's a low-key, very intellectual person, and so I wouldn't have expected to see sort of a very emotional display. That said, these are really two people who have very little in common and are really poles apart on many issues, and that distance came through today in the news conference. 

So no touchy feely. Finally in the last minutes -- 

Far from it. 

-- what about the notions of nationalism building in Europe and some evidence that such nationalist sentiments are building in the United States, what would she want to say to Donald Trump about that? 

Well, you know, she's gotten a bit of good news on that front recently. The far right Populist Party in The Netherlands did not do as well as some thought it would earlier in the week in the election. She's got her own far right party in Germany that, months ago, many in Germany were very worried about. But in recent months, there's also evidence that that party has declined in popularity. And you're beginning to hear a little bit more about what they're calling a sort of a Trump backlash, that some of these far right populist movements in some European countries appear to be running out of steam. So I think that she probably feels better about that issue than she might have last November in the wake of Donald Trump's election. 

Mark Landler, thank you so much. 

Great to be here, John.
