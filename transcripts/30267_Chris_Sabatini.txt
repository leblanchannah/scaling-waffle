Good evening. I'm Ethan Bronner filling in for Charlie Rose. Venezuela, with more proven oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, was once one of the richest countries, not only in Latin America, but in the world. Governed for the past two decades by the socialist Chavista Party and ravaged by corruption and inefficiency, it is now on the verge of collapse, with spreading hunger, rampant violent crime, and triple digit inflation. How bad will it get, is there a solution, and how should the Trump Administration react? Joining me here in New York is Chris Sabatini. He's the executive director of Global Americans and a professor of Latin American Studies at Columbia University. And from Philadelphia is Michael McCarthy. He's a research fellow at American University's Center for Latin American Studies. I'm pleased to welcome them to the program. So, Chris, you're here in the studio with me. I'll start with you. Just speak for a minute or two about how it got so bad given, you know, all the wealth and talent that Venezuela was famous for at one time. 

Well, it was a confluence of issues. First of all, in 1998 when Hugo ChÃ¡vez was elected, it was really the two-party system that had dominated Venezuela for almost 30 years had basically imploded and you had an outsider candidate, a lieutenant colonel who had staged a coup earlier who really came to power promising to clean up the system, and he did, in the sense of he just completely did away with the old system and but in doing so, he also doubled down on Venezuela's oil wealth, which, as you say, is considerable. And over the course of his patronage-driven, very socialist-oriented economy, he basically consolidated the economy around oil. Today 96 percent of Venezuela's exports are based on oil. That was fine when oil was priced at $120 a barrel, but today it's around $40 a barrel, and the country is hurting. 

And beyond that, there are questions of institutions able to withstand the kind of corruption that came in with all of this, right? 

Well, he broke down the barriers between the then semi-state owned oil company, PDVSA, and the government and basically raided its coffers, which also meant that he didn't invest in infrastructure and development, so production has been declining. The central bank has been raided, but as well, he's basically sort of corrupted and undermined and vitiated democratic institutions. The Supreme Court is firmly under his control. The electoral commission is firmly under his control. 

And the congress, which isn't, has no power. 

Has no power. It's been stripped, virtually, of power. 

Michael, a little less than a year ago, you wrote, I think in "The Washington Post," that Venezuela is a powder keg, and you said that there's wide-spread social disorder and triggering instability throughout the continent. Now, I mean, I'm not saying it was sort of a reasonable thing to say, but is that right? Is that still true, or has something shifted and why? 

Great question, Ethan. I think that it's accurate to say that in 2016, the biggest fear those of us who follow Venezuelan politics had was that the possibility of the country exploding in terms of social unrest. And there were, in fact, a number of episodes of instability on a sort of city-wide basis. However, the government hunkered down, deployed the armed forces to repress these protests as much as possible, and it managed to hold onto power. And at the end of 2016, when the opposition managed to mobilize millions of the population on behalf of a recall referendum, the government then blocked that effort, which then set the stage for what people thought was going to be a clash in the last couple of months of 2016. But lo and behold, an international supported dialogue process began immediately, and that cooled the street down and basically de-escalated the situation as 2016 came to an end. And I would describe the Venezuelan population today as basically in a state of depression. They moved through sort of the stages of grief with regards to the death of the recall referendum from mourning to anger to bargaining, and now I think we're in a situation of pretty much depression, where there doesn't feel like there's a sense of possibility or hope about political change. And that helps explain why the beginning of 2017 has been quite a bit calmer on the streets of Venezuela, despite the fact that the country is experiencing a recession marked by hyperinflation -- pardon me, I should say depression, marked by hyperinflation and severe shortages. 

So, I mean, but the thing is that this dialogue that you mentioned, as you say calmed things down, was very much promoted by the United States Government under President Obama. I think the dialogue has essentially collapsed. But I'd be eager to hear from both of you whether you think the dialogue was the right policy. 

First I want to compliment Michael on what he said. It is powder keg. He's absolutely right. It may seem depressed right now, but what has happened in Venezuela, as I mentioned earlier, is this disarticulation of the very institutions and rules that could have mediated and provided some sort of exits. So you've got a hyperpolarized situation, you've got families -- 90 percent of the families are food insecure, are not getting enough, who don't have medicines coming in, people are waiting in long lines. There is a boiling caldron of discontent, and the institutions are simply not there to mediate it. And the government has basically postponed what would have been a constitutional referendum or recall referendum and even elections for the governors. So you really don't have any exits, and the hope was there could be a dialogue. The problem was both the United States, and then later the Vatican, intervened, and also the Union of South American Republics, a South American multilateral organization, tried to foster a dialogue. But there was no rules to the dialogue. They were basically -- they were holding the government unaccountable for the basic rules and rights that it was violating. There were over a hundred political prisoners in Venezuela, and they're not being released or even on the table for discussion. 

So before I get to the dialogue, let me go back to something you said. So Michael said a year ago -- he said it was a powder keg and now he's saying they're in a state of depression. You're saying, no, it is a powder keg. It seems to me there's a difference between whether the place is about to blow or whether the place is just too depressed to do anything. Is it your sense that the streets could explode in Venezuela? 

I still think they could. I think people -- but the problem is, is the situation economically and socially has become so dire that people are pursuing basic human needs and people are basically scrounging in garbage to get food. People are starving. Poverty is at 80 percent. They're pursuing those sort of basic survival needs right now. But that does not mean that there is not deep-seated discontent. 

Of course. 

And a level of repression and obstreperousness from the government that it will, should they begin to protest and take to the streets, I simply don't know where it will go. 

Okay. And, again, before we get to the dialogue, so back to you, Michael, on this question, do you have the sense, actually, when you spoke of moving from powder keg to depression, the impression you gave me was, you know, it's not about to explode. Do you feel it is? Did I misunderstand you? 

No, I think your analysis of my review of 2016 is correct, Ethan. I think at this point the Venezuelan opposition's leadership has a gigantic challenge in front of it, which is to somehow get over the sense of demoralization that exists in the Venezuelan population right now and create a sense of belief again. 

It brings me to asking you whether the dialogue approach was a problematic one from your perspective. 

So, I think that there needs to be some nuancing in terms of how we understand the dialogue's negative effects in country in terms of taking away the opposition's main resource at that time in October and November, which was street mobilization. And that is to say that the opposition accepted a request from the Vatican to not lead a march that was going to culminate in a rally in downtown Caracas. And the Vatican had made that request because it seemed likely that such a rally would result in violence. 

Okay. 

And the opposition basically took a step back. And one could argue that it was a mistake to call off the march completely. But you could also understand why the Vatican made that request, since it's sine qua non for participating in this is that there be some type of peace in the country in terms of the political conflict. But the problem is, is that the Vatican wasn't able to deliver, and at this point, they have somewhat disengaged from the process. And there is a real problem, because in country it's a problem of fire power in Venezuela, and so how do you create a new equilibrium in which the opposition can, in some way, match force with the government? It's going to be very, very difficult. The Trump administration has used the Kingpin authority to make a special designation about the vice president of the country, an unappointed official, that he is a narco-trafficker. That is significant, because it means that should the Maduro government look to make an internal transition, the current vice president would not be viable as the substitute, because how would he travel, right? The other countries would not be able to really recognize this government the same way. So this has been the first attempt by the Trump Administration so far to send a new message. And it's quite clear that the dialogue has basically been put on hold for now. But I think we need to think about talks as a multi-shot game, that is to say it's not just one and done, right? 

Right. 

It's about creating new conditions for a future round. 

Okay. So in the future round you think that the organization for American states might be involved, Chris? 

Currently the secretary general, Luis Almagro, issued a very good report, a 75-page report condemning all of the different abuses. And even the past efforts of dialogue, and saying the government was not held accountable. And as Michael was saying, by engaging in those talks, it basically stripped out the opposition's ability to exercise its fundamental rights, which has really left it somewhat defanged. But I just don't see the Venezuelan government accepting the OES, because the OES has been very outspoken. They've called the secretary general -- or the president has called him trash. It's not a good way to initiate or accept dialogue from that. And dialogue is really, as Michael said, it's not a one and done. This has to be repetitive process. The issue is it has to be done in a way that holds the government accountable. Because right now the government is betting that it can sort of hold the line until next presidential elections in 2018, and at that time, hopefully the price of oil will have gone back up and they can engage in a new round of patronage. 

And do you agree with Michael that this move to name the vice president a drug kingpin by the United States government is an act, in effect, by this administration to say something, to lay a line, because Obama also did the same with the guy who became the interior justice minister as well, and, you know, you do also have the feeling the naming of this man as vice president was also a political act by Maduro, by the President. 

Yeah, this man really is bad news. 

Yeah. He is really one of the most thuggish individuals in power anywhere, right? 

Precisely. He organized for the national policemen. He was head of Aragua governorship, crime spiked. There are very good evidence that he's been involved. You know, the questions are two-fold. One, was this a wise move to spur the dialogue? Some people say no. I think there's another question, and it's a gamble, is that maybe by naming him it will send a message to others within the regime that if you don't sort of start to get in line in the dialogue process, you, too, may lose your privileges to travel to the United States and have bank accounts and yachts and all of your other properties and the goodies in the U.S. that you like to have. 

I imagine those guys aren't moving to the United States very quickly anyway, right? 

Probably not any time soon. But losing those privileges. So I think it's a double-edged sword. It could cut either way. But clearly this government, its immediate reaction was sort of a, you know, basically thumbing its nose at the United States, saying, you know, tough luck. 

Do you guys have the sense that Maduro, as President, will, in fact, allow an election when the electoral calendar turns up? 

I'm not so sure. He basically -- there was a recall referendum that the opposition had demanded that was constitutionally -- and basically they kicked the can down the road, and there was supposed to be gubernatorial and local elections held in December. 

Which they also -- 

They postponed those indefinitely. You know, I think this is a government that realized if it's going to lose an election -- and Maduro's popularity is about 18 percent right now -- they're more than willing to postpone elections. So I think that's the risk, is the dialogue has to get people to elections. But it has to do it under the conditions that elections are free and fair and credible for the opposition to participate. 

This is the thing that the international community has to make sure happens. If there's one thing that we have to ensure in Venezuela is that there's a presidential election within 2018, that we have a clear date for it, with some sort of international guarantee that it takes place. I agree with Chris that it's going to be very difficult. From the government's perspective, the country is in a state of exception. That has been their argument, which is their between-the-lines way of saying, we are in a crisis. They won't say it publicly, but that's what they're really saying when you look at some the rulings by the Supreme Court, for example. And I think that that is the pretext that they're going to try and use to move the date back for those presidential elections for 2019. 

Do you think that the Obama Administration's desire to improve its relations with Cuba and take Cuba out of the freezer the way it's been, caused to have a shortsighted view of what to do in Venezuela? 

I think there's two answers to that question, Ethan. First is, part of the issue is not applying sanctions was, in part, driven by the State Department and a career foreign service officer in the State Department who really wanted to pursue dialogue, who had serious doubts about the opposition. It wasn't just an Obama Administration policy. And I think the Obama Administration made the calculation that Cuba was a lesser national security threat than Venezuela was so went through Cuba. Now did that mean that they trimmed their sales a little bit on being more aggressive on Venezuela? That's possibly true. But I don't think they were linked as directly as one would think. 

Michael, on that? 

Yeah, I mean, I generally agree with Chris there, I mean, I don't think that there's much of a cost to sort of sanctioning Venezuela. There really isn't much of a cost for hitting the country in that regard. It doesn't have even any support for example -- the Chavista Project doesn't have any support internationally, really. Democrats in congress are no longer willing to listen. Liberal democrats are no longer willing to listen to the Maduro government's claims. You have a bipartisan consensus there about the importance of sanctions for standing up for universal human rights. So I think that, although there was that close sequencing, right, December 17th, Obama announced his normalization. December 17th, 2014, he announced his normalization talks with Cuba, and the day after, he signs a bill from Congress, which ultimately resulted in the sanctions in 2015. So there is a connection there. And the point is, is that Venezuela, for the moment, is something where we're trying to really rally the troops. But there still isn't a consensus about what to do, right? No one is really talking about the real value of the most aggressive action, which would be sanctioning Venezuela's oil exports, right? 

Right. 

As you mentioned in the run-up, that would really hit the government where it hurts. But that seems unlikely because of the precedent it would set. We're not talking about a crisis that threatens vital U.S. national security interests, right? So it's a very difficult crisis to manage, and we don't really have that many great options. So the real point here is to argue that there are great costs for disengaging, right? We've made significant progress in ratcheting up pressure, but there still remains a great amount of work to figure out a solution for this highly complicated problem. 

That's a great way to end it, I think. So I want to thank both of our guests tonight, and we'll be back in a minute.
