We begin this evening with this fact: I missed you! And so, it is very good to be back. We have been together, many of us, for more than 25 years. And we have talked about everything from the unfolding discovery of the brain's mysteries to the mind of Russian president Vladimir Putin. And in between, we have seen five presidents, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump. We have met Oscar winners and Nobel laureates, MVP's and Pulitzer Prize recipients and we have met heroes who simply did their duty. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity. Undergoing surgery, no matter how serious, makes you aware of the fragility of life and its purpose. You can only hope that it makes you humble. If you, like me, are one of the lucky ones who get to do what they love to do. So, I come back today rested, ready, and thankful to all who labored while I was gone -- from a great staff to unbelievable substitutes. I come back during a week that suggests how interesting our times are, from the FBI director testifying about a president, to a Supreme Court Justice confirmation, to a vote on the Republican health care plan. Oh, to live in interesting times. I come back thanks to medical science and because of that, I am in the best shape I have been in for a long time. I thank you for your support, and I thank you for staying close. And when we come back, we begin with the testimony of the FBI Director James Comey and the Director of the NSA Mike Rogers and we talk to Representative Adam Schiff and Peter King of the House Intelligence Committee. We begin this evening with the House Intelligence Committee's first public hearing on Russian interference in the presidential election. FBI Director James Comey confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into Russia's meddling, including possible collusion between President Trump's campaign and Russian officials. Director Comey also testified there is no evidence so far to support the president's claims that former President Obama wiretapped him. Lawmakers also heard from NSA Director Mike Rogers. He rejected White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's allegation that the British intelligence agency, GCHQ, conducted surveillance of President Trump. 

I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counter-intelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. And that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts. With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets. 

Did you ever request that your counterparts in GCHQ should wiretap Mr. Trump on behalf of President Obama? 

No sir, nor would I. That would be expressly against the construct of the Five Eyes Agreement that has been in place for decades. 

Joining me now from Washington, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat; and Representative Peter King of New York who also serves on the committee. I am pleased to have both of them on this program. I begin with you, Congressman Schiff, what's the takeaway? What is the impact? What is the significance of what was said today? 

Well, I think there were a few significant things. One, I think the American people got a good sense of why this is such an important matter and really deserves thorough investigation. The breadth of the Russian attack on our democracy, the fact that the FBI has an ongoing investigation to determine whether there was coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, as well as the directors, both of their willingness to establish that there was no evidence to support the president's claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor. Any one of those things, I think on a normal day, would be quite a revelation. But there was a lot packed in today. And I think ultimately the most important thing is it gave a good glimpse of why this is so serious and why we ought to do everything possible to do a thorough investigation and conduct it in a nonpartisan way. 

Why is this so serious? 

Well, because the Intelligence Committee has said this was not a one-off. The Russians will do this again. We can expect them to interfere in our elections again. And in order to inoculate ourselves and to inform the American public so they can evaluate when the Russians meddle again, we have to know exactly what they did here. It's important not only the health of our democracy and our ability to respond to further attacks, but right now Europe is facing the same kind of Russian meddling and obviously we want to do everything in our power to help protect our European allies as well. 

Congressman King, you sat there as well. What did you take away? 

Yes, in somewhat the same takeaway as Adam even though I have a different emphasis. I think it's absolutely essential that we fully investigate the extent of Russian involvement in the campaign. It's disgraceful and as Adam said and as Director Comey said, they're going to come back and do it again, whether it's Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, no matter who the candidate is, they're going to get involved -- try to get involved in the election. And we have to be more alert to it earlier on. I would just say as far as the investigation being conducted by Director Comey, we heard about this some time ago. I know we were officially told a few weeks ago and I recall being at some briefing maybe about a month ago, also hearing. So, we knew the investigation was ongoing. I'm just as glad that it is out there. It gives us a little more freedom to talk and it also may put, not pressure, I shouldn't say that. But usually when something is announced publicly, it's more inclined to move along at a faster pace, but I don't want the director to speed it up. But I think it is important that we try to resolve it. I don't think there is any evidence there so far. I know we can find different people like the Mike Morell, the former acting director of the CIA. He said not only isn't there a fire, there's not even a spark or a campfire, and Director Clapper, we have a disagreement over what he meant by it, but he said that as of January 20th, he was not aware of any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian intelligence or the Russian government. The investigation will go where it goes. Whatever it is, I'll accept it but I think it is important to show that as far as we know there is no evidence yet of any collusion between them. 

Why do you think Clapper said what he said? 

I have to say that Peter is a wonderful colleague and a great member of the committee. I don't share his conviction that there is no evidence here. If there was no evidence, there wouldn't be a basis for Director Comey to have opened the investigation. And certainly on the basis of what I have been briefed in, I think there is more than enough to warrant that investigation as well as our own. Now, I think Director Clapper clarified that what he meant today was that there wasn't conclusive evidence and I would certainly agree with that but let's remember, we're at the beginning of this investigation, not at the end. And at the end of the day, it's my hope that both Peter and I will come to the same conclusion that we were either able to corroborate this, to demonstrate this, to refer this to justice, if that's necessary, or we weren't. And I don't think either one of us should necessarily jump to the conclusion we expect to find at the end of the day. But we ought to, I think, we owe it to the American people to do our best to find out. 

I would just add to that though. You know, there's always some evidence. I would say there is not yet any persuasive or conclusive evidence, but again, if it turns out there is, then I'll accept it. I'm not trying to deny it. I just think that a lot of the stories which were repeated in the media have been as, the assistant director of the FBI, McCabe said, you know, they were B.S., that what his exact term, and so I think we have to be careful before too many allegations are made here. 

As others have noted, the FBI director also spoke to the idea of leaks and how that should be looked into and should be pursued if, in fact, there were leaks that were coming out of the FBI investigation. 

I would say not just looked into. He said he was very alarmed by it. He said he has not seen such a volume of leaks in such a brief period of time going back over the last six to eight weeks. And some of these are clearly top secret, confidential, classified materials coming out, which the director's said do involve felonies, this is very serious. And I'm not talking about palace intrigue or which faction of the White House is fighting with the other. I'm talking about actual evidence which could be gained via FISA wiretaps, which could have been gained by just in the course of an investigation. I have no problem with the investigation. Any investigation is going to have surveillance, it could well have wiretapping. But the misuse of that information is very serious and Director Comey seemed as concerned as anyone by it. So, I think that, I don't, you know, put that off as a side issue, to me it's very significant. 

Why do you think the president continues to insist in the face of all of this denial of anybody having seen any evidence, whether it's conclusive or not, of collusion? 

Well, you know, I can say I think there are only a couple possibilities. Either the president simply cannot back down from a baseless accusation because it would be admitting error. That would be the most benign explanation. The most threatening I think in terms of our country's security explanation would be the president can't tell the difference between fact and fiction. He has now convinced himself that it must be true. And this is a real problem in terms of the future because we know at some point that there will be a crisis, not one that's created within the White House but rather a crisis provoked by North Korea or Iran or some other nation and we're going to need to believe our president. And to the degree he continues to cling to these conspiracy theories with no basis, he's going to make it very hard not only for the American people to believe him, but for our allies. The British already have to have profound questions about this president, considering he and his spokesman are suggesting that they were illegally wiretapping him. So this accusation now has gone way out of control and is doing a lot of damage to our relationships around the world and it's got to stop. And I hope some of the grownups in the White House like General Mattis will sit the president down and say enough is enough. This has got to stop. 

I think the president overshot the mark. I think there are legitimate questions you can raise about whether or not evidence was misused and is being used against him by whoever it is in the Justice Department or the intelligence community or the national security apparatus. But that's a long way from saying the president of the United States ordered a wiretap. I think the president -- he saw what was being leaked against him and he, whether out of anger or whatever, he made these statements. I wish we could back away from it because Adam and I agree. I mean, I want this investigation of Russian collusion, I want it investigated fully. I want it resolved. I don't believe it's going to lead to any, but if it does, it does and whoever is guilty should be prosecuted. On the leaks, I think they have to be fully, fully investigated and the longer we spend talking about whether or not President Obama ordered a wiretap of the president when there is no evidence for it, it just really undercuts all -- what all of us are trying to get done. 

What do we mean by collusion here? I want to come back to the accusation that President Obama had ordered wiretapping. What do we mean by collusion with respect to the campaign? 

The collusion would be mean that whether or not people from the Trump campaign were involved with Russian intelligence or the Russian government in trying to fix the election or actually cooperate in any way. Was there any level of cooperation or collusion depending what term we want to use, or coordination between people in the Trump campaign and anyone involved with the Russian government or Russian intelligence. And that's -- I think Adam would agree, that's the general use the term. There could be modifications to that. It's basically what we are talking about. So far I see no evidence of that, but again, we'll have to see. 

So Congressman Schiff, have you seen evidence of that? 

You know, the way I would describe it, Charlie, is there is circumstantial evidence of coordination. There is direct evidence in my opinion of deception on behalf of many of the people around the president. And of course where people are being dishonest about conversations they have with the Russian ambassador or whether they even met with the Russians, it does provoke questions about why. If this is a policy you're proud of, if this is a policy you're willing to let the country know about and stand behind, then why be deceptive about it? So, these are things that merit investigation. And you know, I completely concur with Peter and I think from the very beginning Peter has said he thought we ought to look into this and look into it, as he always does, in an objective way. 

What happens if the FBI finds there is some collusion? What happens after that? 

If it rises to a criminal level, the person would be prosecuted. And to me, if you are colluding with a foreign government, at the very least, you'd be guilty of lobbying for foreign government without disclosure. That's the very least charge against you. Again, I would leave it to the Justice Department and the FBI. But if you show actual cooperation between an American presidential campaign and any foreign government, certainly a foreign government who is an adversary of ours, there are definitely statutes on the book that would apply and I guess it depends how imaginative the Justice Department want to be. But again, I want to make it clear. I haven't seen any evidence of that, but again, if that's what it turns out to be, I am convinced there'll be prosecutions. 

You've seen circumstantial evidence, you just said, Congressman Schiff. 

Listen, I think there is circumstantial evidence, and again, as the director made clear during the hearing today, he can't chase down every allegation that is presented to the FBI. But when something rises to the level of being credible evidence of either a crime or that someone has become an agent of a foreign power or is coordinating with a foreign power to undermine our election, that it needs to be investigated. He made that decision and I think on the basis of what I have seen, that was a sound decision. But I do think that we shouldn't get too far ahead of ourselves, and think too much about the consequences if that's proven. I think we have a long way to go in the investigation and we ought to let the facts dictate where they take us. 

Who else do you want to see come before the committee? 

You know, I think if we're doing this in a methodical way, we ought to be going through all the raw intelligence, all the documents, allowing those to identify the witnesses we're going to want to bring before the committee. Certainly, I think many of the people whose names you heard today are people of interest to the committee. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we bring them before the committee, but I don't want to get too far ahead in that process. We may or may not get more than one shot with any witness so you want to be prepared, obviously, before they come to the committee. 

Also, it's most likely that, you know, that would be coordinated with the FBI. You don't want to disrupt a criminal investigation, that's always one of those issues. If you bring someone forward, there's a whole question of immunity. There's a whole question of what they would be saying, which gets into other witnesses. So, again, it's a fine line but again, whatever has to be done. I believe that Adam as the ranking member, and Devin Nunes as the chairman of the full committee, will do whatever has to be done to get to the truth here. 

Well, FBI Director Comey said today that it is highly unusual for them to talk about an ongoing investigation. But you have to do it in, when you believe that the national interest demands it, as I remember his statement. 

I think there is so much discussion over this and so many stories, some true, some untrue. And maybe the president brought it to a higher level when he spoke about the wiretapping or he thought was wiretapping. And Director Comey felt he had to come forward and say something. I'm just as glad he did because -- maybe Adam disagrees, but when I'm on a show, several times I found myself saying, talking about an FBI investigation and realized I couldn't even disclose the fact there was an investigation. I think it's important that it is out there. It makes a little bit easier and it also may move the process along. 

Congressman Schiff, when you look at the possibilities here of the president going to the length that he has to continue and to double down on the issue of there being a wiretapping at Trump Tower, and all of the denials that have taken place, why, I ask you why does he do that? And my question now is that at what point does he have the capacity to say if he believes he's wrong, I was wrong? 

Well look, I would have hoped that he would have said that a long time ago. The best course would have been after he sent out those, what may have been early in the morning tweets, to say, OK, somebody needs to take this away from me. I shouldn't have sent those out. I shouldn't have accused my predecessor of gross illegality, but that's not who he is. And I think at some point we have to recognize he is who he is and he will keep doing this and that's going to be a real problem. Again, I hope that someone can talk some sense into him when it comes to making these outlandish accusations because he is undermining his own prospects for success as a president, and he's also undermining our ability to work with our allies. So I hope this stops. I have to say I'm losing confidence it's going to stop. I think this just may be who he is. And you know, this is what you get when you roll the dice, as we have, with someone who has not been elected office before, who we don't really have a track record to evaluate how they would be president of the United States. This may be the way he conducted business. Maybe this is the way he did real estate deals with, you know, half truths and complete untruths, and a lot of bluster. But that is no way to run a country and I'm very concerned about what this means going forward. 

It also says that every president needs somebody that can say no to him or to her. 

Very true. 

True. 

Thank you both. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Congressman Schiff and Congressman King. Back in a moment, stay with us.
