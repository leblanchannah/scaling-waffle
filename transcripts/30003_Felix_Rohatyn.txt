FELIX ROHATYN is here. He is the United States ambassador to France. Before that, he was a very successful investment banker here in New York with a long-standing interest in world affairs. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to talk to him about the role of the ambassador in France and what he is observing over there and a conversation about how he sees the bilateral relationship between the United States and France and how the French see us. Welcome back to the show. It's great have you here. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

You're come back for what reason? 

I came back to vote. 

To vote. Good for you. 

Yes, yes. 

To serve democracy. 

Well, I think it's such a luxury. You know? I'm a new citizen. I mean, I'm a refugee. And I think that voting is just the wonderful experience, and so I really didn't want to vote by mail. I like to go into the booth and pull the-- pull the machine and watch the results at night. I think it's just a great experience. 

Yeah, and you're serving as ambassador to a country that you fled? 

Yes. 

From the Nazis. 

Yes, yes. And, you know, it-- it-- it has mixed feelings-- that memory, but they have received me extremely well. They know my past, and they know the experience I've gone through with my family. And, you know, it's just one of those things. It happened, and the country is very different. The country is very modern. The country is really not at all like its caricature any more than we are the country that they caricature over there. 

How do they see us? And how do they see our present travails? Both in terms of, you know, the investigation into the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and also we're doing in exercising our leadership around the world? 

Well, first in terms of the general caricature, you know. We look at them as sort of an archaic country which is very sort-of-- 

I'll tell you how we look at them. Some people look at them as-- 

Focused on-- 

--as a nation over there that's in love with itself and kinda looks down its nose at the United States, considering us not of their class and not having the sort of-- 

Yeah. Well, there is something to that. We also don't realize at all how modern their industries are or their technology is. And their worldliness in terms of industry. And they kind-of look at us as some kind of a casino society, as a bunch of people who gamble in the stock market all day without any social protection and kind of a-- really, what they call ''capitalism sauvage,'' a savage kind of capitalism. 

Savage capitalism. 

And, of course, that's wrong. And I think it's always bad to have countries with sort-of skewed views of each other because it leads to misunderstandings, and it leads to bad policy. So, one of the things I try to do in every speech I make, in every interview I give, in the way we try to get access to French public opinion is simply to try to explain the United States a little bit better in terms of who we are, how we function, how we see things, and what we do. 

So, what do you say to them when they say that we see you, America, engaged around the world in this savage capitalism and believing that the means to-- the means to achieve any good end is the free market philosophy? 

Well, I say to them that-- to begin with I think that having a 4 percent unemployment rate as opposed to the 12 percent unemployment rate in Europe is probably the best kind of social protection that I can think of and that our policies are geared to this kind of-- this kind of unemployment. We don't want high unemployment. We don't want to pay people not to work. We have a lot of social protection. We have a great deal more than they think we have. We have a riskier type of economy. We're more risk-takers than they are. There's no question about that. I mean, they-- I would say the main difference between the average Frenchman and the average American is that the average Frenchman yearns for a level of equality that we don't aim for. We aim at opportunity rather than equality. And that leads to different priorities in the-- in the-- in the society. But I think it is important, especially now when there is the beginning of-- there is a lot of questioning now of the-- of the open-market system as we've seen the financial crisis in Asia, as we've seen the collapse of societies. 

The role of currency traders and the like and around the world in terms of-- 

Yes, yes. And as you see the election of one left-of-center government after the other in Europe. 

Schroder in Germany-- 

Schroder, Blair-- 

Blair in Britain. 

D'Alema in Italy. Jospin in France. I mean, every major government except Spain and Ireland now in Europe are left or left-of-center governments. 

And what does that say to you. And what do we read from that? 

Well, what they say is they want to look at the market as the servant of society and not as the arbiter of society. They think we view the market as the arbiter of society. And there is something to that. I think there is some illusions on their part about how much you can make the market-- The market's a very power system now and controlling the markets is a difficult exercise. I think-- 

Part of that's what happened in places like Asia, that in combination with corruption. 

Well, it's not only what happened in Asia. It's what happened here with this huge hedge fund that almost brought the whole financial system down. 

Sure, right. Long-Term Planning or whatever it was. 

So, I think there is a point, and I think we all think that way. I think the president talked about it at the meeting of the World Bank and the IMF. Rubin talked about it. It's easier said than done. Transparency is one thing, looking at capital markets and trying to differentiate between short-term capital and long-term capital, between speculative capital and investment capital. These are-- these are-- these are difficult things. But I think that the objective. You can't argue with the objectives of the Europeans to say that we would like the market to be a little more the servant of our society, to have a much more Keynesian type of policies, aimed at employment, for instance, than we believe in. 

John Keynes lives again. 

John Keynes lives again. But John Keynes also said, ''In the long run, we're all dead,'' you know? When you're talkin' about things-- 

That's right. 

Now, you asked me about how they view us at this point in terms of the problems we've had here politically. And I would probably put it on two levels. One -- I think they are completely, completely baffled at an exercise that they see in this country where a president who has performed splendidly with respect to practically every standard you can set about the performance of a country and a government -- economically, politically, militarily -- who has had six years of great success here. 

The foreign policy success have come in the last couple of years. 

Yes, but, you know, they're better than no successes. And they've been very significant. So, they say, ''What are you doing? You know, here you have somebody who's performing exactly what he should be doing, and you're trying to impeach this person for reasons that have nothing to do with his public responsibilities. I mean, you're talking about private behavior on things that are none of the public's business.'' And it kind-of baffles them as to-- as to whether we really have an unstable structure here. And the-- 

Unstable structure? 

Unstable political structure. 

That an independent counsel can have subpoena power to go and dip into the private life of the president of the United States? 

And that the result might be overturning an election of people. You know, that's pretty serious stuff, when your objective is to negate an election, which is the most sacred issue in a democratic society. 

When globalization became the order of the day and money was moving around the world as it was and companies were moving around the world, this was an operative idea -- that the French were not convinced they wanted to jump on that train because they thought it meant somehow sacrificing some elemental quality in their culture that they cherished. 

Mm-hmm (affirmative). 

Are they on-board on globalization? And have they gotten over that fear that somehow globalization was a threat to the French culture? 

Well, the answer is a little bit of both. Big French companies, the main-- the 20, 30 largest French companies are totally globalized. They are totally worldly. They operate just the way American companies operate. 

Right. 

Their CEOs speak English et cetera. At the same time, there is a real fear in France about their culture, about their language, about their way of life, and about this invasion of sort-of English-speaking-- 

They'll be assimilated into a world that-- 

That'll be McDonalds and Coca-Cola and Warner Brothers and Loony Tunes. 

Right. 

On the other hand, what they don't quite understand is that in the United States we have more people speaking Spanish than there are people speaking English in France. And we don't feel threatened by that. 

Yeah. But an interesting idea -- and this is what fascinates me -- one of the most-- one of the things that we import more than anything is our culture, reflected in jeans and movies and those-- I just saw a piece in the New York Times that you may have seen about in Iran the thing that Iranians love -- American movies. 

Mm-hmm (affirmative). 

And their vision of America is in part shaped by American movies. The same thing is true-- 

You see, I have a somewhat different feeling about that. And I've tried to argue the case on these cultural issues, which are very difficult over there-- is that a lot of what they call ''our culture''-- say, McDonalds, Disney, Coke, et cetera. That's really a way of life. It's not so much-- it's not so much a culture. It's we have a different way of life. It's we have people who want to go out to eat. We have people who are in a hurry. He have people who wear their baseball caps backwards because it amuses them, because we're more relaxed, because we're more laid back. So, you know, it's not-- it's not Shakespeare or Gornay or Racine, it's-- 

Yeah. 

--we live differently. 

Not the Western Canon versus something else. 

So, our-- You can say, ''Our popular culture is different because our way of life is different.'' But that's different from talking about the disappearance of a language. 

Right. 

French is not going to disappear. English happens to be the language of business. It happens to be the language of technology. In addition-- 

Around the world? 

Yes. In addition to being the English language, but it has these other attributes which are quite different and, I think, those are things one has to come to grips with. 

Finally, this argument -- you believe-- you, former investment banker, former hugely successful man of capitalism, with always an intellectual bent, believe that the great debate as we enter the next century is gonna be about capitalism? 

Yes. Absolutely. It is going to be about what people view as our kind of capitalism, which I would-- which I would call ''popular capitalism'' with a great deal of participation and stock ownership and profit participation and in the accent being on growth and on opportunity as opposed to the European view-- it's not just the French view, this is a European view of social market capitalism, which is more social democracy. I believe that that is going to be a big argument. Look, we had the argument here when-- 

Is this this-- 

--when New York City was going bankrupt. And we had to put together a plan for the-- for the-- for the-- for the recovery of New York-- is how balanced was the plan going to be as between-- as between social fairness and economic efficiency? 

Do you think that the Europeans and these social democrats have a-- you know, in a sense are-- there is a consensus there that is in opposition to the American consensus? 

I think there is a-- there is a definite-- there is a definite level of kind of philosophical competitiveness with respect to what is the structure of society. What is the optimum structure of society in advanced democracies in the 21st century? I think that's going to be a big issue. I think-- 

Blair articulates this very well. 

It's going to be a big issue in developing countries which have been sort of smashed by the financial crisis and by markets that are, in their view, out of control. I think this is-- this is a big deal. I think there is going to be in this country, I'm afraid, if the economy were to weaken a little bit and if we were to run huge trade deficits as appears likely-- issues of protectionism and isolationism that may come-- may come to the fore, which I'm very, very, very fearful of. 

You're very worried that we will develop-- 

Extreme-- 

--some kind of isolationism. And you think it's reflected in some of the votes in the Congress against the United Nations and against IMF et cetera. 

Yes, I do. And I think that's historically consistent with the history of our country. I mean, if you look back-- if you look back to the '30s, if you look back to before World War I. 

Where-- you seriously believe that this country-- maybe there is a possibility that we will shrink in, that we will move into some kind of isolationist attitude about the world? 

No. I think that there is a risk if things-- if things get difficult and yet we had a very long period of prosperity and people look at a very messy world. I mean, the world is really messy when you look at it out there, whether it's-- whether it's the problems of India and Pakistan, the problems in Japan-- 

Right. 

--the problems in Korea. Everywhere you look, it is difficult. And we're a big country, and people are very self-reliant here. Yes, I could see a time come when people say, ''Well, gee, why do we have to bother with all this stuff? I mean, the Europeans are a big continent. They are wealthy. They have everything we have. Why don't they take care of their business?'' And the Atlantic alliance to me is still the cornerstone of the world's stability, and I think that would be a terrible thing. 

And NATO's playing an increasing role in terms of-- 

I know, when you see what's happening in Kosovo. Yes. 

Yep. It's Kosovo, and-- 

Yeah. 

And other places. It's great to see you again. 

Thank you, Charlie. Happy-- 

Thank you very much. 

It's good to be back even if only for a few days. 

I know, I feel so sorry for you.
