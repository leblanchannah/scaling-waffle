frustration with their government. What is at the heart of this discontent? What is wrong with democracy in America and what can be done about it? Joining me now, 

America in Search of a Public Philosophy. Also ALAN BRINKLEY, professor of history at Columbia, and ERIC ALTERMAN, political columnist for The Nation magazine. In Washington, R.W. APPLE, Jr., of The New York Times. Welcome one and all. Let me begin with you, MICHAEL SANDEL. Tell me what-- in a sense, what you're saying here. It is not an easy read, but it is profound-- raises profound questions about why people do feel disconnected from government and some sense of what you call a procedural-- Right. Well, the starting point, the main idea, is one that I think probably most people would agree with, which is that American politics has stalled. The debate between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, doesn't really reach the things that matter most. And those things, the frustrations and anxieties that have beset American politics for the last 25 years, I think, have to do with two things. One of them is that despite the success of American public life over the last 25 years, the end of the cold war, rising affluence, greater social justice for women and minorities-- despite all of the successes, people feel less and less in control of the forces that govern their lives, a sense of disempowerment. And the second thing, I think, at the heart of the discontent is the sense that from families to neighborhoods to the nation, the moral fabric of community is unraveling around us. And somehow, the reigning political agenda, the debate between Democrats and Republicans, doesn't really address those two things. 

And-- and what-- what do you recommend? 

Well-- and why doesn't it-- 

Yeah, why doesn't it-- (crosstalk) 

Mainly because it's-- it seems to me that American politics has lost its civic voice. It has to do with the public philosophy, with the vision of freedom and citizenship that underlies our political debates. And a central feature of-- of an assumption that all sides share is the idea that government should be neutral toward moral and religious questions. It shouldn't try to affirm any particular idea of the good life. It shouldn't try to cultivate or form civic virtue among citizens. It should leave our character alone and simply aggregate, add up our interests and preferences as if politics and democracy were an extension of a market, where we simply add up and try to cater to people's preferences. But there's an older tradition in American politics that goes back to Jefferson and the founding of the republic, but also extends up through the early part of the 20th century, that doesn't settle for that idea of democracy. It has a stronger idea of citizenship. It says that part of the purpose of public life is to cultivate in citizens the habits and dispositions, the qualities of character that will enable us to be effective citizens, to have a say in shaping the forces that govern our collective destiny. 

Johnny, what do you think of this idea? 

Well, there are several ideas contained in all of that. I think two or three things. I think, first of all, that it overlooks the fact that all of this is taking place during-- is set in the context of a number of worldwide revolutions that our politics is not prepared to deal with. One of the reasons people feel disconnected from their politics, out of control of things, is that we are having a worldwide communications revolution, simultaneously with a worldwide political revolution, simultaneously with a worldwide economic revolution. This feeling of powerlessness or confusion, lack of direction, lack of social anchoring, is not unique to the United States at this late date in the 20th century. It can be found in many Western European countries, as well. I think, further, that the analysis, while I don't disagree with it, ignores the fact that another reason for these feelings is the sense that most Americans have that politicians lie to them all the time and they're in it only for their own selfish interests. I might add that they think that journalists lie to them most of the time, as well. They don't like us any better than they like them. I think those are two elements that we ought to add into this picture of American politics stalled and lost. 

Alan? 

Well, Michael is too modest to say that-- that he is one of the leading voices in a very large group of scholars and intellectuals and, increasingly, politicians who have embraced the idea of community and civic life as something that is worthy of political attention. And I think the reason that this has happened is, in large part, what Michael has said. It's also, I think, because we're living in an age of such profound economic change. There are so many people whose economic lives have become unhinged from the stabilizing forces that 20 years ago, 30 years ago they could have expected to support them. People have become beset with anxiety about their economic lives. In addition to that, over the last 30 years, we've gone through what I don't think it's too much to say is a kind of cultural revolution in which the sort of consensual moral norms that somehow become embedded in our-- in our public life and our popular culture, even, have exploded and there's an enormous array of moral visions that we see when we look at television or movies or read books and newspapers. So I think that the idea of community is so alluring to so many people today because we look around us and we see a society that we have a hard time making sense of. We don't have any answers, any public answers, for the economic problems that are probably the greatest source of popular discontent at the moment, but we do have a vision of what kind of community life that we think, at least, that we can recreate. 

I guess I-- I put myself also in the fans of Michael's book. I've been using it. I've been trying to figure out how the country could democratize its foreign policy, something it never tried to do, even in the heyday of its Republican era. And the questions facing a functioning democracy, given the-- given what the global-- the global economy does to our communities are staggering. But I guess I find the book enormously useful and the argument enormously useful for its historical content. It leaves me cold when we get to the future, though. You can see all over the country, all over the culture, this thirst for community. You can hear it in Bruce Springsteen's lyrics. You can see it if you go see Rent on Broadway. And yet no one is willing to face up to the question of how do we deal with these economic forces, and largely global corporate forces, that are reordering the lives of the American people. Just real quickly-- if you are-- if you've got to commute for two hours to get to your job because that's the only place you can get a high-paying job, or if you work for, say, Boeing, and even in times of profitability, they're-- they're threatening to cut back your job or outsource your work, you haven't got time to be a good communitarian. You haven't got time to take care of your community. And that's the problem that a lot of Americans are facing. Whether-- whether they're up against it or not, they're worried about it. 

Let me come back to-- Johnny? 

Yes, sir? 

This sense of discontent and the sense of-- of the title, Democracy's Discontent, in the sense of this procedural Republican of right over good, right being some procedural right and good being the common good-- I mean, when you-- as you used to do and as you still do, travel around the country, sensing the mood of the-- of the body politic of America, do you feel that there is any connection between the discontent and the absence of participating in self-government? 

I'll have to come back to something I said before, which nobody picked up on. Perhaps they all disagree with me. People who care about these issues, people who feel disconnected, people who feel discontented do not look to government at much of any level as the-- as the solution. The most obvious evidence of that is our voting rates. More subtle evidence is their immersion in pressure groups rather than parties, rather than candidates, rather than electoral politics to seek a remedy. One obvious element of this is the Perot movement. With all of its problems, with all of its fragmentation and controversy, they've still got about a million and a half, a million, three people signing-- signing nominating petitions and those are people who are trying to use politics to reconnect to the system. One thing that interests me greatly about the solutions proffered in the book is that I don't think the American people, at the moment, are willing to give up very much in order to achieve broader common goals. Americans on the doorstep, in focus groups, in town meetings, all talk about how they've been let down by various institutions-- by television, by the political system, by the universities, even by those who labor in the inner cities to try to make life better. What nobody ever says is that it's the individual's fault, in part, that it's the voters' fault, in part. This relentless sense of entitlement, this sense that, ''Yes, we have to change things, but not if it changes anything that I get in an envelope from Washington.'' I think that's one point of attack that we have to choose early, if we're going to make any headway in reestablishing common goals and a public philosophy, both-- both eminently suitable objects of our attention, in my view. 

Okay. Go ahead, Michael. Then I've got a couple questions. Go ahead. 

I wonder if I could quickly try to respond to the challenge that Eric laid on the table about what are the solutions? Even if the diagnosis is persuasive, what are-- what are we left with in the way of solutions or is it just overwhelming? 

Elimination of the nation state. 

Well, I wouldn't say exactly that, but a new way of thinking about politics and debating political issues-- 

Yeah. 

--to try to fill the emptiness, the moral and civic emptiness in our political debate. Look at what's going on now in our politics. I think we see a groping for a language to talk about moral and civic dimension of public life. Some of it may be politically uncontroversial and not very demanding, but-- we hear talk about the V-chip and curfews and school uniforms and Hollywood movies and rap music. Suddenly, this range of questions, moral and cultural and sometimes religiously informed concerns, is becoming prominent on both sides of the political agenda. That seems to me an expression of this yearning for a richer moral and civic language in our politics. But one dimension is missing, and this goes to Eric's challenge, and that is, especially those liberals or progressives who have tried to incorporate -- belatedly, I think -- a moral and civic vocabulary that's richer than merely procedural and rights-oriented. What about the economy? Liberals sometimes have raised the fact, pointed attention to the fact, that the gap between rich and poor in the United States is approaching levels not seen since the late 1920s. But too often, the arguments that liberals make about that has only to do with the unfairness to individuals. And there is grave unfairness, in my view. I agree with that. But what they haven't talked enough about -- and this would be one source of rejuvenated civic vocabulary in our politics -- are the civic consequences of the gap between rich and poor, which has to do with the secession of the affluent from the common life, from the public life-- gated communities where there are private schools, private roads, private police forces, private recreation centers. The more and more we live separate lives, the less it's going to be possible to deliberate about the common good. We haven't heard very much about the economic dimension of the civic traditions. 

But there's a good reason for that and that's because both parties are responsible to the same corporate elite that-- that sets the terms of the debate. In 1968-- I mean, this is in response to Johnny's point that he thought no one picked up. In 1968 we had a presidential election where neither candidate was willing to take the majority position on Vietnam. There was an entire movement that was ripping this country apart, but both candidates were responding to this extremely narrow viewpoint. Now, today we have another moral crisis facing the country and that is what to do about the global onslaught on our economy, on our standard of living, on our communities. And yet both parties are responding exclusively to this very narrow band of opinion, which is in the realm of sort of respectable corporate elite. I think it's amazing-- and Alan made this point in a very good essay last week in The New York Times. It's just amazing that the two-- that the two most exciting-- the only two politicians who are getting a response in America besides Perot are Jesse Jackson, on the one hand, and Pat Buchanan, on the other hand. They've got the same people in their camp. These are people who are thirsting to hear the kind of voice Michael's talking about and they're not getting it from the political system. 

And if Buchanan had been nominated, it would have forced Clinton to address these very-- larger moral and civic concerns in a way that he will not be forced to address them, given that his opponent will be Robert Dole. 

Because they're cut out of the same fabric? 

Because-- who, Dole and-- 

Dole and Clinton. 

Well, because Dole represents a very traditional, unimaginative, standard Republican political position and so he and Clinton will fight for the-- the established, conventional political center. 

Right. 

And he won't be forced to offer a progressive alternative to the politics Buchanan offered when he talked about disempowerment and community and moral authority in his campaign, though from the perspective of, you know, a right-wing version of that. 

Alan? 

Well, I-- I think one of the things that-- that I find most interesting about Michael's very good book is that he links the idea of community, which is so resonant in political rhetoric, although so absent from actual political life and public policy-- but he links it to a tradition that isn't just a kind of romantic vision of small towns and people living happily together. That's a vision that's very popular, particularly with conservatives, but it's not one that leads us to any particular political solution. He links it to a tradition in our national politics that, as he said a moment ago, goes way back in our history and makes it-- it's a tradition that, if we could retrieve it, would make it possible to think of community not just in terms of neighborhoods, but also in terms of the nation as a kind of community. And that's, I think, what-- what everyone here tonight has been saying, in a way, is that we don't have a way of thinking of ourselves as a nation-- as a national community in which we have obligations to one another. You hear this language in Clinton's speeches occasionally and we'll probably hear them in Dole's, but nothing in what any candidate does or says really addresses the central national problems that make people feel so separated from one another. 

It's awfully easy to speak for the voice of the community if you're not asking the community to make any sacrifices. To-- to make the kind of reversal of-- 

This is ''morning in America'' or Reagan's part or-- 

Exactly. I mean, Reagan could speak for a-- Reagan could speak for a certain vision because it was free. Perot could run and independent campaign because he paid for it. But if you ask people to change their lives, to make sacrifices, to give up an hour with their kids or their favorite television show, you have to be able to deliver things which -- A -- people are not certain the system can deliver at all and -- B -- are very difficult to get through the media. That's-- I mean, that's another problem we haven't brought up, but aside from this show, aside from maybe Nightline, aside from Bill Moyers's specials, where are you going to get a chance to discuss these problems in depth and give them even a hint of the complexity that they deserve? It's very difficult. And if you can't give them the complexity they deserve, you're going to lose the sound bite war. The reason the Clinton administration was afraid to propose a single-payer health insurance program at the beginning of the administration was people said ''The Republicans will call it a tax and we don't have a nine-second answer for that.'' Now, 70 percent of the people polled happened to support that when they were told about it, but you never get a chance to explain it in enough detail and it loses the sound bite war. So I think unless we can sensitize the media to some of these complexities, there's no hope of communicating it. 

The element of sacrifice, I think, is an important one and the-- the civic tradition that I've tried to describe in this book-- 

Yeah. 

--is one that always worried about one particular kind of sacrifice, to do with consumption. It was wary of consumption because too much-- civic virtue was a way of reining in people's appetites because if you allow consumption to be the driving force, citizenship gets crowded out to one side. 

John Adams died a despondent man because of the consumption attitudes that he saw developing in the country in 1787. 

And the shift-- one of the shifts -- and Alan has written about this, as well -- in the 20th century is-- is that politics in the 19th century and into the 20th was-- appealed to people, in large part, in their capacity as producers and gradually there was a shift to appeal to people as consumers, citizen consumers. And that leant strength to the idea that politics is really an extension-- is the market by other means, a way of adding up what people want and trying to give it to them. 

Let me transfer this again to candidates, though, and to leadership. I mean, do all of you sense that there is some yearning for a different kind of leadership in America that-- that on the one hand, as Eric says, will call on the country to sacrifice? Because it seems to me that not many candidates win elections by promising tough times, by demanding that people live through tough times. Candidates win elections-- that's not the product of the media, but candidates win elections by, in a sense, appealing to, as Reagan did -- ''morning in America'' -- appealing to what they consider the best instincts of America and hope in America, rather than difficulty. 

Well, I don't-- I don't think it's clear that a candidate who asked people to make real sacrifices would do well in American politics and I think it's-- it's too easy simply to point to the problems of the media and the power of corporate elites, although that's all very true. We don't have a tradition, at least in our recent past, of asking citizens to make sacrifices except in wartime and-- and not even then, in our recent wars, not since World War II. 

Yeah. 

And the sacrifices even in World War 

Charlie? 

Yeah? 

I happened last week to take part in a conference, a one-day conference, with a group of Australian leaders and Paul Kelly (sp? ), the editor of The Australian, the leading newspaper in that country, said that it was his impression that in his country there had developed a crisis represented by a gulf between what politicians knew to be good policy for the health of the society and what was achievable, in a practical sense, through the political system. I've thought about that a fair amount since and tried it out on a lot of leading politicians in Washington and they've all said, ''Absolutely. That's what's going on here.'' And several of them have said to me, ''And that's why I didn't run for president.'' I think that whether they're right or not, they don't believe any longer that there is a reward in politics for proposing what one honestly thinks is the best policy for building the society and ministering to its ills. 

But isn't that apparent, in terms of the debate we're having about economic growth in the country right now? 

Yes. The debate-- 

I lose-- I lose patience with politicians who say they would like to do the right thing, but they can't. These are the guys who are running the system. These are the guys who are not passing a campaign finance law which would allow them to speak truth to power. They-- I mean, who-- who-- what do we elect them for? What is the-- what is the meaning of public trust if not to tell people what they don't want to hear? It's-- it's shameful. They shouldn't be in politics if they're going to talk that way. 

And what is leadership about, in the end? 

Exactly. 

So in a word, sum up for me, Michael. I mean, you are calling for-- 

Calling-- 

--participation in self-government. 

Right. 

And what? 

Calling for a new way, but really reviving an older way, of thinking and arguing about politics. And that civic voice of American politics that I'm arguing we need to try to revitalize and translate into terms relevant to our time-- that civic voice says that the first question we should ask of a law or a policy that we're arguing about is what kind of citizens will it cultivate? What sort of habits and dispositions will it create in us? 

What kind of America will it produce? 

What kind of America will it produce, instead of asking, as we typically ask now, ''What will it-- what will be its effect on economic growth and prosperity and what will be its effect on the individual's capacity to choose his or her own preferences''-- 

What kind of community do we want to live in and what are its values and don't we have a stake in those values and should government be neutral with respect to those values? 

I say that the idea that government can be neutral with respect to values is-- is an illusion. It can't-- 

An illusion. 

It's an illusion. And when we try to be neutral in the name of not coercing people and not legislating morality, what happens is public life becomes emptied out of moral meaning and fundamentalists rush in where liberals fear to tread. 

In the end, a return to some classical republican way of thinking? 

Well, I-- 

Not in terms of party, but in terms of the nature of a republic. 

What I'm for? 

Yes. 

Drawing on the classical republican tradition that put citizenship first, but trying to figure out-- and the questions people have put are important challenges-- trying to figure out how that old tradition that put citizenship first can be translated into a world such as ours where we have-- 

Where there's a global economy and all of that. 

That's it. That's it. 

Okay. Johnny Apple, thank you. I apologize for you having to wait, so-- but as always, it's my pleasure to have you on the program. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Thank you, Eric. Great to have you back, Alan, as always. Michael, I look forward to more conversations about this subject-- America in Search of a Public Philosophy is the subtitle, the title, Democracy's Discontent. No one ever said democracy was easy.
