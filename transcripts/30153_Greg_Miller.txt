Good evening. I am Roger Cohen filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin the program with WikiLeaks. The anti-secrecy organization released thousands of CIA documents and files today. The leaked information exposed tools the agency uses to hack smart phones, computers, and even internet connected televisions. It's believed to be among the biggest leaks of classified information in recent history. The authenticity of the documents has yet to be determined. WikiLeaks has indicated the source of the files is a current or former CIA contractor. Joining me now from Washington is Greg Miller of The Washington Post. Welcome, Greg. 

Thank you. 

Greg, hi. How do you assess the importance of this WikiLeaks disclosure right now? 

Well, that's a good caveat because I actually think it might take weeks, if not longer, to get the full measure of the impact here. But for now, I mean, it looks like the CIA's sort of cyber weapons arsenal has, to a large extent, been laid bare. We haven't seen WikiLeaks posting actual code that somebody could sort of aim and shoot to carry out an actual hack. Instead it looks like blueprints and documents that describe its capabilities, and they are extensive. Including, as you mentioned, the ability to turn every day devices that millions and millions of people use, smart phones, Apple phones, Android phones, iPads, and even television sets, into collection tools for the agency. 

So, you or I might be using What's App or some kind of Samsung TV and unbeknownst to us the CIA might be listening in? 

Well, if you or I were doing that, or at least if I were doing that as a U.S. citizen and the agency were monitoring my communications, it would be in some trouble, hopefully. 

Hopefully, yes. 

But, yes. I mean, that's what these files illuminate. So the CIA has a very distinct role in sort of cyber espionage. It's built up its capability in this realm for years and years. It is more of sort of a black bag shop than is the national security agency, which we read about a couple of years ago amid the Snowden revelations which is scooping up mountains and mountains of data every day from the internet. This is more narrow, more targeted. But, yes, I mean, the capabilities that are revealed here are enormous. 

What do you make of the timing of this, Greg? Why now? Why do you think WikiLeaks chose this moment six weeks into the administration? A lot of tensions with the intelligence services, a lot of unresolved issues, why now? Do you think there was a specific purpose in the timing? 

You know, that is a really god question. I have talked to people who were also very curious about that. It's hard to know. I think that it certainly will please WikiLeaks to be able to sort of poke the CIA in the eye with this revelation right now. It comes -- it's awkward in some ways for the Trump administration because President Trump has declared himself to be such a fan of WikiLeaks, you know, cited the e-mail, the Hillary Clinton e-mails during his campaign, said at one point, I love WikiLeaks. Sided with WikiLeaks over the CIA in terms of whether Russia was behind the theft of all of those Democratic e-mails. 

Do you think he'll still love WikiLeaks after this? 

I mean -- 

Do you think he'll say anything? 

Well, he hasn't so far, and his press secretary has been utterly silent on this, which I think tells you that the U.S. government is really trying to sort out what happened here, was really caught off guard by this. I don't see any indication yet that the CIA saw this coming and had prepared the White House or anyone else. 

Do you expect President Trump to react? I know he's unpredictable. 

It's almost in his nature to react to something like this, right? I mean, yes, I think I do. How he will react to this is hard to know. This is -- the CIA is now run by Mike Pompeo, Trump's pick for that job. Will Trump enjoy seeing the CIA squirm as some of its most sensitive and valuable espionage tools are exposed? I don't know. 

How damaging is this to our national security? 

You know that's a question that we're really trying to sort out. I mean, I think that it is significantly damaging, but not to the extent that it will, you know, make the agency go dark in any way on any important target, right? This reveals how the CIA probably gathers information on a lot of legitimate adversaries, including a terrorist group like the Islamic state whose members use cellphones, cameras, video equipment, computers. I mean, these documents can help you sort out how the agency might go about penetrating those networks and -- 

But that's very useful to our enemies, right? 

Yes. So this could be highly useful to enemies, including, there are snippets of code here that amount to signatures that an adversary like Russia could use to search its systems to see if there are embedded CIA implants in any of its devices and networks. 

What's your sense of who the source might be? And do you think that the president will go after the source? 

Yes. Well, so WikiLeaks in its statement releasing these files, said that its source is a current or former intelligence contractor who obtained these files through some sort of unauthorized disclosure. There is a lot of suspicion among U.S. officials, of course, that Russia may be involved here. U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russia and WikiLeaks often work hand in hand, although, there is a counter argument here. I mean, if these were -- the sensitivity of these files is such that you would expect Russia perhaps to sit on them, take advantage of this knowledge without only using it to embarrass the United States. 

How would you compare this, Greg, to the Snowden revelation? Snowden is in Russia, of course, now, and... 

Yes. 

What sort of -- there are different things going on here, but U.S. intelligence is being compromised in various ways. How would you -- what comparison would you make? 

Right. So there are similarities and differences if we take WikiLeaks at its word, it appears to have another Snowden-type contractor out there providing a lot of secret information to WikiLeaks. There are some differences. So the Snowden revelations had immediate political repercussions and fallout, in large part because they were exposing massive surveillance programs in which millions of Americans' communications were swept up. So that was immediate -- there was an immediate reaction, a visceral reaction from the public that may not come here because these are much more narrow kind of operations that the agency is conducting and there is nothing that we have seen in these files so far that would indicate that any of it is being used against U.S. citizens. 

So are these revelations more gratuitous? In the case of Snowden, you can certainly argue and many have, that this in the end produced some positive effects, very positive effects for U.S. society, and the debate between freedom and security. In this case, it seems on the face of it, more gratuitous. This is just the way the CIA goes about gathering information and these secrets are useful to our enemies, why would anyone want to reveal that? We didn't want to hurt the United States. 

Yes. I think you are right that perhaps it's harder to see a meaningful public debate emerge from this leak, the way we saw after the Snowden revelations. Perhaps you could argue that, you know, Silicon Valley companies, including Apple, Google, and others, they will be implicated here. They are already very nervous about perception overseas that they work with U.S. intelligence agencies, that they designed flaws into their devices that enable the CIA and the NSA to monitor others overseas, and perhaps there will be some sort of reaction in countries like Germany, one of the disclosures, one of these documents suggests that the CIA has a massive hacking enterprise based in Frankfurt, Germany. But I think you're right that it's hard to compare these to the Snowden revelations in terms of the sort of propriety of the collection that they describe. 

We've gone in a very short space of time, Greg, from no drama Obama to high drama, relentless drama, Donald Trump, and an administration that really didn't leak, to an administration that seems to be leaking all over the place. This is -- what is it like working in a Washington where leaks of various kinds are pretty much an everyday occurrence? 

I mean, it's really disorienting, I have to say. I have covered national security in Washington for quite a long time now, and I've never seen anything like this, where every day there is a prospect of an enormous revelation. And this one may not fall into the same category of all of those leaks that seem aimed at that exposing what the Trump administration is doing in its early days. But, yes, it's not how Washington has worked for years and years. I mean, that might sound odd. Of course, leaks have been around forever in Washington, but the volume, the nature, I mean, they reflect a level of tension and distrust between the top levels of the White House and other areas of government that is just in some ways -- 

Particularly the intelligence services in some cases, no? 

Exactly. I mean, Trump has repeatedly disparaged the CIA and other intelligence services, dismissed its conclusions about Russia, an incredibly important subject, accused it of being engaged in using Nazi-like tactics to smear him. And then, seemingly surprised that there could be leaks that would undermine his position or authority. 

How do you think Mike Pompeo will respond to the WikiLeaks revelation today? Do you expect a response of some kind? 

I don't expect necessarily a public response from Mike Pompeo. I think the CIA, so far is declining to comment on this. The White House is declining to comment on this. We are monitoring closely to see what sort of investigation takes shape now, like -- it's clear the CIA will have to mount a really big counter intelligence probe to figure out what happened here, and will probably have to relay a crimes report to the FBI, which will also have to investigate. But I think, right now, I have to say, my impression is that they are just still in sorting out mode, what just happened? 

Will the CIA have to change its methods? 

Undoubtedly, I mean, I think that's clear. Although experts I have talked to have said that that is weirdly manageable, like you would expect that a revelation like this to be such a catastrophic setback that they would send them back to square one. But the reality is that these exploits for things like the iPhone are developed on this errative basis over and over again. Every time there is a new software update that patches some security flaw, there is another counter effort by spy agencies to find something new that they can get their hooks into. There was some confusion initially on these WikiLeaks files about whether the CIA had managed to crack the encryption used in very popular applications like What's App or Signal, that doesn't appear to be the case here. It looks like the agency's ability to work around those encryption programs depends on their ability to manipulate the devices themselves, not the apps that are loaded on to them. 

So it's fixable? 

I mean, I do think so. I think it will require some significant regrouping, but we've seen this over and over again. They certainly regrouped after the Snowden revelations. 

Greg, thank you very much. Thank you. 

Thank you.
