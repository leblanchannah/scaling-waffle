President Trump's vision to remake American healthcare was dealt a surprising and devastating blow today, the president and House Republican leaders decided to pull legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act after facing stiff resistance from both conservative and moderate factions within the party. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan rushed to the White House to alert the president he lacked the votes to move forward. He addressed reporters later this afternoon to explain why the vote did not take place. 

We came really close today, but we came up short. I spoke to the president just a little while ago. I told him that the best thing I think to do is pull this bill and he agreed with that decision. I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. 

Joining me from Capitol Hill is Kelsey Snell. She covers Congress for "The Washington Post." Welcome. 

Thank you so much for having me. 

What a week. 

It has been quite a whirlwind. We started out this week, thinking we would be ending with our first vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and here we are having it all gone up in smoke. 

What does that mean? That it's gone up in smoke, for the future of the president, the Speaker of the House, the Freedom Caucus, and Democrats? 

We've already heard the president say that this is the fault of Democrats and that this didn't work out because Democrats wouldn't help them out. But in reality, what happened here is that the Republican Party just couldn't coalesce around a single message. They couldn't decide what it was they wanted to do once Obamacare was repealed. They all have agreed for many, many years that repeal was the goal, but the finer details wound up getting the best of them. I think there is a real question now about what kind of governing coalition exists within the Republican Party and how Republicans in the House will work together, how they'll work with the president, and if anybody's really in control here. 

Does it mean that the Freedom Caucus has some kind of veto in close votes? 

I mean, they do at this point have enough votes that if they stick together, they can stop any legislation. This was a real test for them. If they had backed down, if they had met with the president and walked away, saying that "he was charming, he was a good salesman and he won us over," and walked away, they wouldn't have that power. But they've reaffirmed something that they've been trying to establish for years, which is that they can stick together better than other factions of the Republican Party. 

What does it mean for President Trump's ability to use the bully pulpit? 

It means that he -- actually, we don't really know. What we know is he can pressure some people but not everybody, and we don't know exactly how voters and his core constituents are going to respond to this. It's entirely possible that they don't blame Trump and they blame House Speaker Paul Ryan, because, as Trump said, he did not want this to be called Trumpcare. He wanted to call it something else and the name Ryancare has kind of stuck, so this failure may fall to the Speaker of the House rather than the president. 

But doesn't the president need Ryan for every other aspect of his agenda? 

He certainly does, but it is important to remember that Ryan shares some of these goals. Ryan desperately would like to get tax reform done, it's something he's been talking about since I can remember. And they agree on that, they agree that this is a goal. And there are some people up here who feel like repealing the Affordable Care Act was kind of an adopted issue for President Trump and that tax reform really is more at the core of the principles that he kind of ran on and things he has believed in his business career. 

Tax reform and reform in regulations together. 

Yes, and those are two things where they can really find a lot of common ground. And you know, tax reform is really hard. I was a tax reporter for many, many years and I think people discount exactly how complicated it can be. There's a reason it hasn't happened in a generation and there's a reason why this is something that takes time. So we'll be watching very closely for when they actually get started on the process of doing tax reform. 

Does it affect immigration? 

I think immigration is its own separate thing. It affects immigration if they want to build coalitions with Democrats and if they want to do some sort of immigration plan that was kind of "Gang of 8" style, that builds consensus, but at this point, it seems like they need to reset and kind of figure out what their next step is first. 

At the end of the week, where is the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch? 

Well, we were expecting that to happen, not this next week, but the week after, and we haven't heard yet from majority leader Mitch McConnell about whether or not he wants to move up that process in any way. So where it stands now is that Democrats say they're willing to filibuster him and we are going to see a big blowout fight in the Senate once that actually happens. The question now is just how long it takes. 

What about infrastructure spending? 

Infrastructure spending is one of those things that we have heard about for a long time, it was a goal of this current White House in the campaign, but we haven't seen any legislation or really any solid proposals beyond the idea that the president wants to make a large investment there. That is also an area where details matter. Are we talking about roads and bridges? Are we talking about highways or trains? That all still needs to be fleshed out before they can move forward. 

Is the president's credibility damaged? 

You know, I think it is for some people. It's yet to be seen how his core voters feel. His core voters have seemed to be flexible in how they view Trump and they support him as a person. It's about personality first, many of his core voters. So this may or may not actually change their feelings about him. If he can successfully deflect the criticism of what happened this week over to the House Speaker or to someone else, then it's possible he walks away unscathed. 

It is a pleasure to meet you, thank you so much for joining us at the end of a long week. 

Thank you so much for having me. 

We continue with Al Hunt of "Bloomberg view." Al, let me just start by, you've seen lots of weeks in Washington both as a reporter on The Hill and in other remarkably interesting stories that you have followed in different places. How does this match up? 

Charlie, when I was with you on Tuesday, I thought it was an exhausting week, and this is -- it's ten times more exhausting today than it was three days ago. This is just -- I don't think I've ever quite seen a week quite like this, maybe Watergate. I suppose you would have to go back 40-some years, but other than that, I've never quite seen a week like this, with all the legislative and the executive and the law enforcement thing. But the vote today in the House and Friday, the decision to pull the healthcare bill, I must admit was a shocker for me. I thought when you get this close, you're going to pass it and the stakes were so big. This is a devastating defeat for Paul Ryan, for Donald Trump, but also for the Republican Party, which, for seven years, has promised something that they couldn't deliver on. 

Does this mean, according to what Paul Ryan said, that after pulling the bill, you know, that for the foreseeable future the Affordable Care Act will remain in place? 

They have no choice. They'll probably, you know, they'll try to nick it, they'll try to do this and that, but Trump wants them to move on to other things, taxes in particular, and they have to. But once there is blood in the water, it doesn't go away, and sharks continue to sense that blood. So, yes, I think they will be able to turn to other issues now, but this defeat will last for a long time, including on the campaign trail next year. As I say, go back to 2010. If there was any centerpiece to what hundreds of Republicans promised, we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. It ended up an empty promise, Charlie, not just because they failed, but because the product they came up with was one that almost one no one liked. Doctors didn't like it. Hospitals didn't like it. Consumers didn't like it. Liberals, conservatives, it had 17 percent approval in a Quinnipiac poll. The old saying, you can market dog food as well and exquisitely as you want to, but if it isn't any good, the dogs won't eat it. And today, you had not only right wing conservatives, members of the Freedom Caucus, but you had people like Rodney Frelinghuysen, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of the cardinals; Barbara Comstock, a really savvy politician from suburban Washington, a moderate who said, no, I don't care what you say are the stakes, we can't do this. 

So what does it mean in terms of the rest of the president's agenda? 

What it means is that they wasted a couple of months. You know, the first was Pat Moynihan who said, "boy, that first year of presidency is so important, that's when you get things done," so, you know, they've now wasted, I don't know, 15 percent of it. Waste in the sense that they couldn't accomplish anything. They will turn to taxes as soon as they can. That is not going to be easy. The one thing that is apparent now, that was probably apparent beforehand, is Trump is really not a political threat to these members unless it's a member from a conservative district who is voting against Trump on liberal grounds or on more moderate grounds. None of these members were afraid that Trump was going to come out against them in a primary and hurt them, they really weren't. Let me give the president his due. I do think he lobbied this and went member to member as effectively as any president in a long time. A lot of people didn't think he could do that. He did that very well, but he had a product that I don't think he knew much about and you couldn't sell. 

We now talk about the House Freedom Caucus. How is it different from the Tea Party and the caucus that it bred in the House, during the reign of John Boehner? 

It is similar and there are many similar members, people like the aforementioned Jim Jordan in Ohio, I think they feel a bit emboldened, they've been elected two, three, four times, they think they are safe now. They're uncomfortable with Trump. There are things they like about Trump a lot -- Immigration and some of the social issues. They don't think he is a real true believing conservative, because he is not. I think they will be with him on some things but they're not afraid to stand up to him on something like this. 

And what about the immigration? 

Well, I think they would be with him on immigration. I think the problem you have there is to put together a coalition -- I don't think you can get any kind of major immigration through, Charlie, without Democrats. Right now, the mood is not very receptive on the Democratic side to work together on much of anything. That may change by the summer, by May, but right now, it's not very promising. 

And what does it do to whatever factions there are within the White House? Does one gain and the other lose? 

As I said earlier, there were hundreds of members. That was the prime commitment they made, we're going to repeal and replace it and, again, the repeal part was very easy. The replace part was impossible. They ended up with a bill that 24 million people lost their insurance. By the time they were making deals, it really wasn't going to cut the deficit any and it was unpopular. So you can't blame this one on the White House. So, therefore, I'm not quite sure it changes the internal dynamics a lot, although, I'm sure that Steve Bannon will say, see, I told you so. 

Al Hunt in Washington, thank you, my friend. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Back in a moment, stay with us. Would they have the votes or not? That was the question in Washington all week long. President Trump insisted House of Representatives vote at 3:30 this afternoon on the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, but at the last minute, the president told Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, to pull the bill. Mike Allen joins me now from Washington, where he has been tracking the story. He is the co-founder of the news service Axios and the editor of the "Axios AM Newsletter. Mike, let me begin with what some might say, an assessment, others might say an autopsy. What happened? 

Well Charlie, we had epic miscalculations at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue from beginning to end. So President Trump, beginning -- we're seeing in "The New York Times" that he decided to go ahead with health care, to plunge ahead with health care rather than taking up the, perhaps, easier win of tax reform almost on a lark, in a very quick conversation where he didn't really delve into the pluses and minuses. At the other end of the Pennsylvania Avenue, at the beginning, Speaker Ryan, looking at this more from a matter of policy than politics. Charlie, when you talk to House leadership about how rough this looked for the different parts of their conference, they would always retreat to policy answers, when in the end, Charlie, this came down to pure raw politics, person to person, miscalculation at the end. So, Charlie, Axios is told that until the very end, people thought it would be nip and tuck, looked very close. They just were hoping they would limp over the line, but in fact, the bottom fell out. The numbers were going to be terrible and that's, in the end, why they reversed their course and pulled the bill instead of having a vote. The thinking in the White House, Charlie, had been to go and have the vote even if you lose, and the calculation was that, say you tried, that you blamed Democrats, and if you're the more Machiavellian members of the White House team, you then have a list of who's with you and who's against you. You have a list of what Republicans weren't being helpful. That was appealing to the White House. Here's where they were wrong, Charlie. They were looking at this as a vote unto itself. But life is not a series of one-offs. Charlie, as you know, life is a story. Life is a tapestry. Whatever happened today is going to have huge consequences for the rest of the Trump agenda. That is the big takeaway from today, Charlie, is that, now everything else will be harder. Tax reform, and eventually infrastructure, and whatever they want to do on immigration, just among Republicans, there isn't trust, there is not appetite, there is not sea legs, there is not confidence that Ryan can deliver, and it makes anything that they want to do more complicated and is going to cause them to have to pull in the sites of their ambition. 

And does it mean that members of Congress and members of the Republican Party, and certainly members of the Freedom Caucus are not afraid of the president? 

Well, that's true and the fact that that's been true for a while is part of this. So, Charlie, you and I have talked about how President Trump, because of the way he was elected, had a very powerful tool, and that is the digital bully pulpit, in a way that no other president has. He could use his Twitter feed and his direct communication to lobby and punish and stroke individual members. But it looks like the president focused on the member-to-member, individual part of this fairly late, and we were talking about how there must have been a lot of trips in the last -- a lot of invitations to Mar-a-Lago, and, So, do you golf? But you would have thought that would've been happening sooner. So the president wasn't directly engaged with these members, and at the same time, he was getting less popular. This is where he is paying the check for some of the distractions that you and I have been covering over these weeks and months. So not only were they not afraid of him, they weren't as aligned with him. Here's the twist in what happened is that there is an argument that, for the politics of 2018, for the politics of 2020, Republicans actually may be better off. The reason that they had so much trouble figuring out how to work this Rubik's cube is the politics of it back home for these members were terrible. Whichever way these members went, they were going to have a problem back home. After campaigning on this for seven years, after taking repeated votes to get rid of Obamacare, they needed to try. But, Charlie, and this is something that you don't very often hear talked about in the Acela Corridor between us and Washington and you in New York, but the real-world effects of this bill were very worrisome to a lot of members of Congress and should have been worrisome to the White House. Charlie, you've covered how much of the Trump coalition, some of the struggling, hard-working Americans who are having a rough time were dependent on Obamacare. A lot of them either needed parts of the Obamacare program, or people that they love were involved with that. And, so, the effect of it hadn't really kicked in and was going to take a while to all kick in. But Republicans may be better off being able to blame Obama, blame Democrats and not own the health care system which, under the best circumstances, was not going to get better overnight and, under this bill, would have given them a lot of explaining to do. 

What does it say about Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, other than he has some of the same problems that John Boehner had? 

Yeah, so a great Tweet said, somewhere John Boehner is sipping a glass of merlot. (LAUGHTER) It's harder than it looks, isn't it, young man? There is no question about that. And this marriage between the Speaker and the President, as you know, was always going to be an arranged and difficult marriage. Then, at the end, when they were in such different places, the White House clearly was planning to take credit if this passed and blame Paul Ryan if it didn't, and the president trying to bully, frankly, the Speaker at the end, telling him to go ahead and take this vote, the president thinking of it in classic deal terms, and that is, on Wall Street, deals die again and again before they're finally done, and, so, the gamble was, you go ahead and get this vote and eventually you're going to be better off. The Speaker saw his support evaporating and knew that that wasn't going to be the case. So, Charlie, the Republicans are now saying that they're going to move on, that they're not going to try and fix this on Monday morning, they're not going to retake this up. Plunging into tax reform this morning at an Axios News Shapers event, I had a conversation with the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, his first on-stage interview. And we talked about tax reform and he was arguing that in some ways, tax reform is simpler than healthcare, and I said, you talk to anybody who was around here in 1986, I think you will get some skeptics on that because he is arguing that tax reform is goodies and, yes, tax reform has goodies in it, but there also are people who lose out on the other end. So now we're plunging into another completely politically-fraught argument, something, again, where, on policy, White House, House, Senate, all in slightly different places, Speaker Ryan insistent on moving ahead with this border adjustment tax, which makes it more expensive to bring goods into the country and could raise a trillion dollars that could be used for tax relief elsewhere, but that makes things cost more at Walmart. If you're a senator from Arkansas, like, that is not a very tough decision. I asked Steve Mnuchin today about the border adjustment tax and I said to him, let's say I work at Walmart, let's say I shop at Walmart, which I do, explain to me why a border adjustment tax is good for me. And you saw in his answer that there was no particular embrace of it by the White House. So why that is important, Charlie, and these packages always come and go, as you know, but the White House already is in a very different place than the House, and in the tax code where a break for one person is an egregious outrage for another, trying to work that tetris after this last experience, very hard. 

I think this week will show President Trump is facing collision of some of his campaign promises. They are in direct collision with each other and some of the things he promised he can't deliver because it affects some other things he promised. 

That's a very brilliant point, and it's like why you couldn't make the math work on health care, that for every single change you made that made it more palatable to conservatives, you not only made it less palatable to moderates, people in tough districts, the few people in swing districts, but you made it less likely to pass the Senate, more likely that these members were, in the very vivid, memorable words of Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas: "walking the plank," taking a tough vote for something that had no chance of becoming law and that is why there was so much pressure on the Speaker in the last 12 hours. There was no way that his members wanted him to have to take a vote that clearly was going to go down or was going to go nowhere. So you're right about this collision, Charlie, not only within the issues but among the issues. 

Michael, thank you so much. 

Treat to be on, happy weekend, Charlie. 

We'll be right back. Stay with us. What is truth in politics, specifically as it applies to President Trump? Is truth dead? That is the cover story of this week "Time" magazine and managing editor Nancy Gibbs is here. "All the President's Lies" is the title of David Leonhardt's latest column in "The New York Times." He joins us now from Washington. Nancy Gibbs, tell me, where are we in this question of truth and how difficult is it for journalists? 

Journalists have been debating for a long time about when you say someone is lying, and the challenge there is that it's much easier for us to check facts. We always do that and know this statement is true, this statement is not true, this statement is partially true. When you talk about whether someone is lying, there is an added layer of intent, of, what is it that they know and believe? Are they mistaken? Are they intentionally stating a falsehood? And I think that is where this president has posed a particular challenge to the people who are covering him. A great many things that he says are demonstrably false. But there is the second question about how many of the things that he says would qualify as lies -- he knows what he is saying is false -- and how many of them are actually things that are untrue but he believes that they are
