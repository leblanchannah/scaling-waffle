when we continue. 

Good evening. I'm Jeff Glor filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with a look at the GOP health-care bill. Yesterday the congressional Budget Office released its assessment of the House republican's health-care proposal, known as the American Healthcare Act. The report found that the bill would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over a decade but would also leave 24 million more Americans uninsured during that same period. The news will likely complicate the parties' efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Joining me now from Washington is Max Ehrenfreund of the Washington Post and Jim Tankersley of Vox. Welcome to both of you. And Max, let me start with you. The CBO report here has now had more than 24 hours to marinate in Washington. How is it sitting? 

Well it's not sitting especially well, to be quite honest. There are a number of moderate republican lawmakers whose votes will be very important for getting this bill passed who are worried about the fact that CBO projects, as you said, some 24 million more Americans could be uninsured at the end of a decade if it's enacted as planned. And that's definitely a concern for the republican leadership. On the other side, there are also some hard-line republicans are really concerned about the fact that although the bill does decrease the deficit by about $337 billion over ten years, that that's probably not enough for them, and they would like to see greater reduction in government borrowing. 

But, Max, the White House knew that the uninsured number was going to be a big number, which is why they started pushing back over the weekend. 

Yeah, I think that's exactly right. It wasn't necessarily a surprise that so many people are likely to become uninsured if this bill is enacted. Republicans have been saying for a long time that they want to reduce federal spending on health care, and health care isn't free, so if the spending is reduced, that implies that more Americans will have to pay more themselves or just go without. So that wasn't a surprise. But I do think that the CBO setting it down in black and white has made the issue a little bit more real for republicans. They're having to confront it now publicly. They're being asked about it by reporters, and probably their constituents as well, and so they're having to think about it in a way that perhaps they didn't before. 

Jim, this is a challenging thing; right, taking on the CBO the nonpartisan CBO, which is headed by a conservative economist, a hand picked by republicans. This is would seem to be a tough row to hoe. 

Yeah, it's a little bit like arguing with the refs in a basketball game. You can make cases on the margins that they're doing things that are not what you would have done, that you would not have call it had fouls that way. But at the end of the day, they are the arbiters of Washington, and have been for a long time. So republicans have had several strategies, it appears, for how they're going to counter this. The White House has sort of tried to undermine the credibility of CBO. Paul Ryan talked about how this is not as bad of a score as he was expecting. There are a bunch of different reactions, but they all boil down to the fact is they're reckoning not so much with an analysis, a particular analysis from CBO, but with a reality of lost coverage. Whether you think it's going to be 24 million or 20 million or however you want to slice it whether other analyses they might produce, the White House might produce its own, for example, they have to reckon with the real possibility here, the very likelihood that Donald Trump is not going to make good on his promise to ensure more people, not fewer, and that is the central problem that we're into. 

Jim, we should point out, the CBO has always had a very tough time predicting what's going to happen in the future. 

Well, sure. As we all do. But health care is actually, to get a little bit nerdy about this, health care is particularly tricky to model, and the CBO was wrong about certain ways that individuals, companies, and marketplaces would react to the Affordable Care Act after it was passed. That said, CBO did a better job than pretty much anybody in getting in the ballpark on that. So, again, I don't think we should treat 24 million as a hard fast, this is absolutely what's going to happen, number, but we should consider that to be, you know, part of a range, a point in a range of possibilities, all of which look very bad for republicans as they try to push a bill that they say is going to improve access, not restrict it. 

And, Max, as that push continues, Paul Ryan wants to do it quickly. The President wanted to do it quickly. Right now it doesn't seem like it's going to happen quickly. 

No, I don't think so. There have also been requests from some of it have senate, especially Senator Tom Cotton, a republican, who have asked the leadership in the house to, you know, slow things down and try to take another crack at the baseball here to address some of the concerns that CBO has raised. But I think Jim's point is a good one. It's very difficult to see how republicans will be able to revise this bill to avoid the fact that, you know, millions of Americans would become uninsured under the republican plan. It's part of what republicans are trying to do, which is reduce the role of government in the health-care sector, one of the most important sectors of the economy. And when it happens, it seems very likely that more people will be uninsured. 

Jim, who wins if a bill like this moves forward? 

Well there are a few big winners. Obviously the wealthy are the biggest winner, because there's a lot of tax cuts for them in this bill. One way you can look at it is this is a bill that reduces taxes, mostly on the rich, by about $600 million over a decade and funds that, more than funds that, by reducing spending on the poor. So if you're rich you're going to pay lower taxes, and you didn't really need government buying health care anyway. The sneaky other winner in this, though, are upper middle class Americans, people who made too much money, like if you're an individual, like from $50,000 to $75,000 a year, you weren't getting help from Obama Care to buy health insurance. Well you actually are going to get help from this bill. CBO pointed out in the score. So while that help will decline over time, in terms of how far it goes to help you buy health care, it still is something in there for a group that I don't think we thought was going to be a big winner in this plan. 

Max, Sean Spicer today talked about this being one of three prongs when it comes to trying to get the health-care legislation through, or repeal and replace. What are the other prongs that we're talking about here? 

The two other prongs that Sean Spicer is referring to are, first, the possibility for regulatory action by the Trump Administration, not to change the law, but to change the way that the current law is implemented and try to move the health-care system in a more market-oriented direction. That's what they're planning to do. And then the third prong is republicans are saying that somehow they're going to come up with 60 votes in the senate and move a bipartisan bill that will address some of the more technical questions in health care legislation that do not directly relate to the budget or the deficit, and, thus, are subject to a democratic filibuster. Now Senator Cotton, who I mentioned earlier, had a very good response to this. He pointed out that it seems very unlikely that republicans will be able to get the 60 votes they need in senate to pursue that third prong without a filibuster. And then on the second prong, we'll have to wait and see what the courts say, because it's likely that democrats will seek to move back against whatever the Trump Administration is doing through the judiciary. 

And whether it's Tom Cotton or Rand Paul, was the White House expecting this senate resistance? 

That's a good question. I think they certainly should have been expecting it. Certainly the intent of republicans in repealing the Affordable Care Act, the kind of system that they wanted, has been clear for a long time. Republicans described their plans in a whitepaper over the summer that speaker Ryan and some of these colleagues in the House put together. And so it's always been clear that what the republicans have hoped to do. And it's always been clear that some republicans would not like that plan, and this is not necessarily a plan that would easily unite the party. Perhaps, you know, republicans have spent a lot of time, especially President Trump and his allies have spent a lot of time saying this process of repeal will be easy, and perhaps, to some degree, they started to believe their own rhetoric on that point. But it's just never been true. 

And, Jim, can you talk about the dynamic right now between Paul Ryan, who is trying to lead this and trying to convince folks in the senate to go along, both that relationship and the continuing and long and interesting relationship between the speaker and the President. 

The speaker of the house has not been a particularly attractive job in Washington for quite a while now, and I think we're seeing why at the moment. Paul Ryan is caught between several different political forces. On one hand you have, like what Max mentioned, the Tom Cottons and Ted Cruz' of the world who are very concerned that this bill is not conservative enough, that it's not doing enough to enact these market-based solutions that conservatives really believe will help Americans buy health care for themselves. On the other hand, you have a whole bunch of senators in particular, and some moderate republicans in the house, who are worried about these big coverage losses that have been highlighted by CBO. And who will probably push for more ways to guard against that sort of coverage loss, which then makes the conservatives, the more conservative members even more upset. And then you have the President who has promised a bunch of things that are, frankly, not possible to deliver all at once, given the bill that he is starting with. So you have Donald Trump's big plans that everyone's going to pay less for health care and everyone's going to be covered, and you have two very different ways of looking at that in the house and in the senate, and Paul Ryan is stuck trying to make all of that into a bill that can pass, and not just pass, but be something that republicans can defend and be proud of going into future elections. 

Do we have a sense right now, Jim, of how similar this bill is to what Paul Ryan was dreaming of, say, a few years ago? 

I think there's some big differences between this and what Paul Ryan is dreaming of. I think the real reasons for that is because this is going through that reconciliation process to try to avoid a filibuster. Look, what republicans really would like, and particularly the party base, and what Paul Ryan, as an adherent of free-market philosophy, really believes in is an idea of really getting the government out of health care, creating more competition, allowing insurers to sell new and different kind of products, and so that basically every American who wants it can afford to buy health care to some degree. The idea that the market will solve the problem, this bill doesn't really do that to anywhere near the extent that I think Paul Ryan or other conservatives would like if they didn't have to run through that little hoop to avoid the filibuster. 

Max, Jim talks about reconciliation, and you wrote about the challenges that republicans have with reconciliation. 

Yeah, that's right. And in that respect, the CBO score that was published Monday did give republicans an important reason to breathe a sigh of relief. I mean, if the CBO had said this bill is going to increase the deficit, if this bill is going to force the government to borrow more money, then it seems that the bill would have been subject to a democratic filibuster in the senate, and basically the whole project would have ended at that point. Instead, the CBO said that this bill is likely to save the government some money, about $30 billion a year, or so, and as a result of that, republicans can move ahead with their plan to avoid a filibuster. But as we have been discussing, there are still some serious challenges. 

Jim, what happens next? 

What happens next is a budget markup, a big hearing in the House on Wednesday, where they're going to just keep moving this thing forward in the House. Let's stop and appreciate just how fast this bill is moving for something that doesn't appear to have, from the outside, a ton of grass roots support and does not have a lot of interest groups or big players in Washington behind it. But what it does have is the leadership in congress and, it appears, the force, to some degree, of the Presidency. So it's going to keep moving through congress. Eventually it will come to a floor vote, and then we'll start to see, I think, the really big challenges. Can they keep enough of the freedom caucus, the most conservative members in the house to get it through there? If they do kick it to the senate, it will almost certainly have to change fairly dramatically to try to get through the senate. And then what happens, these are high hurdles, but they start with just keeping it moving as quickly as republicans can towards some sort of legislative outcome. 

Max, one of the President's big selling points here in the campaign was the deal-making, right? How much of this -- what is his role right now? Is this a light touch or heavy touch behind the scenes? 

From what we understand, it's a light touch, and it's very much behind the scenes. I note that when the speaker, Paul Ryan, went to his home state of Wisconsin to announce the bill last week, President Trump did not go with him. Instead, it was Vice President Pence. And I think that some people in the White House, I'm not sure of this, but it does seem as though perhaps some people in the White House are wary of associating Trump too closely with a bill that could very well fail ultimately. And so we've heard that Trump is meeting with conservative lawmakers. He is trying to get them on board with this project, and so far at least, we're not sure if that effort will be successful on Trump's part. We're not sure if he'll be able to deliver on being the deal maker that he said he was during the campaign. 

Because it was tagged Obama care, and President Obama came to embrace that, eventually, term, he said. But now it's Trump Care. 

That's right. That's right. And today Sean Spicer, the Press Secretary, said that Trump did not want this bill to be called Trump Care, which does raise the question of how seriously Trump is supporting it publicly or behind the scenes. 

All right. Max Ehrenfreund of the Washington Post, and Jim Tankersley of Vox, thank you both very much. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

We continue this evening with a look at new policy on drone strikes. President Trump has reportedly loosened Obama era restrictions applicable to targeted killings outside active war zones. The changes give greater autonomy to the CIA and the pentagon to conduct counterterrorism operations. Joining me now from Washington is Greg Jaffe of the Washington Post and Gordon Lubold of the Wall Street Journal. I'm pleased to welcome them both to this program. Gordon, let me start with you. What is new about this and why is the White House doing this? 

Mr. Trump visit the CIA that first day after being inaugurated and got briefed. And I think, then, soon thereabouts provided essentially an informal authority to the CIA to return to these -- to continue to conduct drone strikes, which they had heretofore not been doing under the Obama Administration, at least in its later years. So what the authority was, was to give the CIA permission to conduct strikes, in particular, in Syria. We have some evidence that suggests that they've also done one in Pakistan as well. But then we saw in Syria about four or five -- three weeks ago, they targeted an Al-Qaeda leader in northern Syria. So that was kind of the first known example of the CIA's taking this authority since they got it from Mr. Trump. 

And so, but, Gordon, there has long been the sort of feisty turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon over drone strikes. 

Right. So there's always been this kind of bureaucratic squabbling over this issue. Under pressure from human rights groups and others, Mr. Obama had kind of settled on getting the kind of hybrid solution, where the CIA and the DOD work together to mount a strike. So it's basically the CIA providing the intelligence and the analysis, and then at the last minute, allowing the DOD to essentially pull the trigger, but thus, allowing that mission to be largely publicly accountable and transparent. And that was a place where Mr. Obama had pushed to have that happen, so now this is the beginning of what could be a reversal of that policy under Mr. Trump, who has clearly signaled that he wants to kind of accelerate the fight against Islamic state and other groups. 

And, Greg, how easy or complicated is it going to be to change the drone rules? 

You know, I think it's relatively easy. They were presidential policy guidance, so it was guidance that President Obama set down that he was hoping to set a standard that would tie the hands of the successor a little bit. But there's no legal mandate that President Trump has to follow those rules. 

Greg, so what was the Obama Administration worried about that the Trump Administration may not be worried about. 

You know, I think the big thing President Obama was worried about was that you have this incredibly powerful tool that allows you to launch strikes anywhere in the world at very low cost to U.S. personnel, and very low cost to taxpayer dollars, and so he wanted some sort of set of rules, particularly outside of active combat areas, that would set a threshold for these strikes. You know, if you're going to use American power to kill somebody, he wanted to make sure that it was absolutely necessary. 

President Obama was not always shy about using that power. 

No, he wasn't. And, in fact, he used it very heavily early in his administration. And so it's around 2013 where he looks at it and thinks, gosh, the technology has really accelerated. His administration was using it quite heavily and felt like, hey, we need to put some rules on the road in place to govern this. 

Gordon, can you talk about more of that technology acceleration and how much better the drone technology has become and how quickly it advances and how easy it can be for the military to rely on this. 

Right. I mean, Greg's right, I mean, if you came home with an addictive tool for the Obama Administration, which was low to send troops into harm's way but you could do this kind of antiseptically. You know, the technology's gotten better. The number of drones, although they're still under high demand by the military, are more plentiful and, you know, U.S. Government has eyes in the sky in all these places. Military commanders will say they never have quite enough. But it is an effective way to conduct counterterrorism operations from the sky and without getting, you know, U.S. troops' feet wet in that sense. I think, you know, we see Mr. Trump wanting to accelerate this fight and thinking this is an easy and good way to do it. But why not bring the CIA back into it so you have essentially both agencies kind of working more closely on this fight. 

Gordon, so can you talk more about how these decisions are made. 

Well, you know, under the Obama Administration, decisions were kept at a very high level. And if you talk to military folks, sometimes they expressed frustration at what they would be perceive, in some cases, as micromanagement by the Obama White House in terms of deciding whether a target vetted, you know, to what degree a target should be vetted. And in some cases, you know, in the case of one target they had in Libya, I think in 2015, it took like eight months to get the decision to green light for that particular operation. So we're seeing, on the military side, Mr. Trump's interest in delegating a lot of that authority down anyway, and now we're seeing, potentially, the camel's nose in the tent with the CIA. The two agencies do have different vetting thresholds, and the CIA's is higher, and this is not in terms of civilian casualties, but just in terms of deciding a certain target is the actual target they're after. CIA's is higher than the military's for different reasons, but it's also just kind of driven by culture of both places being significantly different when comes to doing this. And so what the military would tell you is, is that using their drones by the way, the CIA's use -- you know, these are military drones they're using -- they can take sometimes months to decide and conclude on a target and execute that target, whereas the Defense Department, which is designed to kind of be more results oriented, whatever, could maybe execute that target a lot sooner. So there's a disparity in the thresholds that's going to come into play as they decide how this new authority expands or not. 

So, Greg, the CIA would argue that they're more effective at these strikes. 

Yeah, that certainly was the argument that they made, particularly in Pakistan where they have been operating for a period. You know, you get to know the area and the terrain and the people. In Yemen, for a while, both the CIA and military, I think, were taking drone strikes. And there was a perception, I think in the White House and elsewhere, that the CIA had become better at it because they had been doing for longer. I think the military, in some cases, would push back on the notion. 

Greg, on the broader point here, Sean Spicer addressed ISIS in the briefing, at least yesterday, and a lot of this information is kept under wraps or hasn't been released because they say they don't want those the administration is fighting to figure out what's going on here exactly. But beyond drone strikes, the overall strategy, what more do we know or have we learned from the first month-plus in office for the new administration? 

You know, I think so far we haven't seen major changes. You know, it's still very much sort of what they call the Obama Administration and what, the military calls a by with and through strategy. In other words, we're not going to commit large number of U.S. troops to direct combat. We're going to work through indigenous allies on the ground. And that's largely what's been done in both Iraq and Syria. I think you see a small change in that, you know, there's more -- commanders are being allowed to take more risk in term of pushing U.S. advisors further forward on the battlefield, a little bit more artillery support on the ground, but just not major shifts. 

Gordon, if we see more troops on the ground, where will it be? 

I think largely what a lot of the commanders are going to say, that they need more advisors. We know that in Afghanistan that they would like more advisors, and that is probably going to be likely true in Iraq and Syria. Potentially more combat forces. Greg's right that there's more openness to exposing the military, which are deployed to these places, to more risk, and so you may have, you know, a higher number of Special Forces say, "Go into Syria." We've already seen conventional forces going in there. Because I think that you can't overhaul this whole strategy. It's going to stay the way it really was under Obama, but you can tweak it by adding more troops here and there and just kind of turning it up a little bit. But I think Mr. Trump is probably learning that, you know, there's not a magic bullet to just kind of make this thing happen a lot quicker than it was happening already. 

But, Gordon, the notion of advisors has always been an interesting term; right? 

Well, right, because you could kind of drive a truck through the definition of what an advisor does, and you can also, you know, advisors up to now were supposed to stay far away from actual combat, and they had this kind of weird term of art of, you know, one terrain feature behind the frontline. This has been blurred anyway, even under Mr. Obama, and it was always hard because a lot of journalists like us can't get in and embed with these guys to see what they're actually doing. So it was already blurry. I think it's going to become blurrier. The question will be whether the Trump Administration wants to be more open about what it is the troops are doing. I think Mr. Trump would like to kind of keep most of what the military does under wraps. I don't think we're going to have an embedded media program or whatever, and it's going to be hard to assess what they're doing. But definitely the advising can be a euphemism for just almost actual combat for the U.S. troops. 

Already making it harder to assess what the State Department is doing, and no indications that it's happening on the military side as well. Greg Jaffe from the Washington Post and Gordon Lubold from the Wall Street Journal, thank you both very much. 

Thank you. 

Thanks. 

Danny Boyle is here. He's directed such acclaimed films as "28 Days Later," "127 Hours," and "Steve Jobs." He won the Academy Award for best director in 2009 for "Slumdog Millionaire." Boyle first made a name for himself as a filmmaker with his 1996 cult film "Train spotting." The film followed a group of heroin addicts living in squalor in Scotland. Now over 20 years after the original film, Boyle and the original cast have reunited for a highly anticipated sequel. Here's the trailer for "T2, Trainspotting." 

I missed you, man. 

I missed you, too, Spud. Choose your future. Choose wishing you'd done it all differently. Choose life. 

Twenty years just flowing by, yeah? 

We shared our very first hit. Your blood is in my veins, man. 

Do you still take heroin? 

No, not for 20 years. You're an addict. So be addicted. Just be addicted to something else. Take a deep breath and choose life. 

I'm so happy to have Danny Boyle at this table. Welcome. 

Thank, Jeff. 

So a lot of time there's a pressure after such big hits like Trainspotting to do the sequel right away. 

Yeah. 

This didn't happen right away. 

Well I don't have any memory of it. I mean, you would think -- 

Of them wanting you to do it. 

Of anybody expressing an interest in it. You would normally -- commerce would expect to step in at that moment and say that's an unexpected hit. You know, we could do that again, pay the actors a bit more money and everybody would be happy to do it again, yeah? I don't remember any of that pressure at the time. I think there was so much astonishment that it had worked, and not just in Britain, but also globally as well, that it transferred, because it's so specific. I think people were just frozen. Their minds were frozen in astonishment. I thought it's a one-off. It will never happen again. Irving Welsh who wrote the original book, "Trainspotting," he published a sequel, like, seven years later, which was a ten-years-later sequel, that took the characters ten years on, and we tried. We had a go adapting that to try and see if that could be a sequel. 

Tough subject matter. 

Yeah. And it was also -- it wasn't as -- the book's not a great book, the original book, in my mind, and we didn't do a very good job adapting it, and I knew that people would be very disappointed if we put that out. It would have felt like a quite cheap rehash of what we had done originally. And the original is thought of as being very, very original, and so it would be to besmirch it to follow it with something that was highly repetitive, and so we left it. And it was only when the 20 years later, the 20-year anniversary loomed on the horizon that we sat down around a table very like this down in Edinburgh, the two writers, Irving Welsh and John Hodge, the screenwriter, myself, and the two producers, and we talked about it. And something a bit more personal emerged, a bit more painful really, about men aging over time, really, and what men -- because of course they indulge themselves as much as it was ever possible to imagine someone indulging themselves on the edges of society. And then to be caught in what it means to become -- to move from that boyhood to that manhood, to manhood really, and the film really is a study of male -- of masculinity over that time period. 

It's reflective, and it's sad, because what's happened to them over these 20 years is not necessarily wild success. 

No, it isn't. They feel like they've been treading water at best, and Spud, for instance, has remained an addict, on, off in rehab, back on, back addicted, and Sick Boy is in an ever-decreasing circle of scams, really. And Renton has had this crisis where he's fled to with their money. And he's forced back by this crisis, really, medical crisis. 

This is Mark Renton who took off with all the money at the end of the original movie. 

Yeah. 

-- for those who -- and everyone's still upset with him over this. 

Yeah. So he runs away. 

This is Ewan McGregor. 

This is Ewan McGregor. He runs away, and 20 years later he's still running, on a treadmill now, and then there's -- a wall is hit very, very hard, and he's forced to return to where he comes from and to friends who appear to have just been in status until he gets back. And Begbie, the ferocious Begbie, the Robert Carlyle character, has been, understandably, in jail for 20 years. Given his violence, he ends up in jail. But he comes out of jail, of course, and they all eventually meet to relive the past in one sense, or to take revenge on it really, which is Begbie's preoccupation. 

They weren't role models back then for sure. 

No. 

Do you want them to be role models now? 

No. I don't think you can apply that phrase to them. 

In any way? 

No, I don't think so. I think we look to them for kind of an almost an alternative view. And I think that was the success of the first film, is these were voices from the margins that had such a distinctive point of view and such a coruscating sense of humor that they were attractive despite their circumstances, despite some of the things that they were going through, which one of us would wish upon our enemies really. Today, now, they feel they're washed up more, really, because it's no longer -- although they try to, it's no longer possible for them to endlessly try and repeat the glories of the past as they see them. So I don't think you could see them as role models now. But they certainly look like people that we recognize, probably from the more extreme sides of our experience or our friends, but you recognize them as people that you probably have in your own circle of friends, you know. There's the violent one who's always going to be fighting. There's the chaotic one, the clown, Spud. And you kind of see your own -- I'm sure that's one of the reasons it appealed to people so much, you know. And that it was unapologetic as well. It didn't make any apology for what it was doing, for what it was saying, for what it was looking at, and for their behavior. It didn't condone it, nor did it apologize for it. 

Yeah. More things change the more they stay the same with these guys. 

Indeed, which those sound like old cliches. You realize a cliche is a cliche because they're often -- 

They're often true. 

They're often true. 

The name "T2," so this has gotten a lot of attention; right? I mean, I'm just curious about the genesis of this, because when people think T2, they think "Terminator 2;" right? 

Yeah. 

James Cameron and all that stuff. You didn't want to call it just "Trainspotting. This went through all number of developments in terms of a title. 

Yes, it did actually. We original -- we wouldn't call it "Trainspotting at all originally, and that seems perverse, but it was very important to nourishing the film on its own, so it didn't feel like it was going to be a sequel. Of course it is a sequel. You're bringing back four actors to play the same four characters. It's necessarily so. But you wanted it to develop its own identity and to cherish and nourish that a little before getting into the inevitable. So when we do that, it got on its own feet and we worked out its relationship with the original film in more detail, we admitted to the studio, okay, we will call it -- but we want to call it not quite Trainspotting, we want to call it "T2," and they said, "Why?" They said, "Everybody who goes online is going to go to the James Cameron film. They're going to book for a James Cameron book or DVD." And we said, "No, it's because if they were -- the characters, if we ask the characters themselves, 'What would you call the sequel if you were going to be in it,' they would say, 'well you should name it after that really great sequel, Terminator 2'." So we called it "T2" Terminator -- oh, "T2 Trainspotting" rather. And it is a tribute to James Cameron. That is one to have greatest sequels of all time. And there's never been -- we've never bettered the liquid robots. No one has. And so it's hats off to James Cameron. But it was also to slightly annoy him as well, because that's what these characters' nature, they're perverse and contrary like that. 

You're trolling him a little bit. 

You know, in the nicest possible way. 

So did you talk to James Cameron about the title? 

No, we didn't have to because apparently it's a nickname. It's not a legally declared name for a film. Everybody lazily says "T2" for it. So we thought we'd have a joke. The film is full of that kind of -- both films are full of that kind of irreverence, really. It's a kind of inbuilt part of their -- it's part of their DNA to behave in a disrespectful way to those who have gone before them, really. 

So all the guys had come, or some had never left, but they all come back to Edinburgh, and are sort of trying to figure out the next way to make money. 

Yeah. 

To make a living. To do it in whatever way they can, and they just, in various ways, haven't been successful for two decades. 

Yeah. They scam. They scam. Their nature is to scam, if they can, which is to kind of con people out of money or to steal money, either from individual's wallets, and you see them stealing credit cards from people and PIN numbers from people, or from the European Union actually. They applied for funding for one of their projects to the European Union. And they get it. 

They get it. 

Astonishingly. It can't be that easy, surely. But in this circumstance -- it's a movie -- they do get some funding from them. 

You mentioned the European Union, and this movie, the film was being shot as Brexit was playing out, and now there's talk of another Scottish referendum. This takes place in Scotland. And there are some themes of nationalism here. I'm just wondering how topical you wanted to try to be and how much you were thinking about that as you were making it. 

I mean, obviously some people do choose to make films that they wish to be topical. I find that very difficult because they take so long to make movies that if you want to be -- it's a serious risk if you want to be topical, if that's the reason for your film. I mean, people do read things into them. I was just based more on how the characters behave rather than a kind of world view we might have about politics particularly. It would be impossible. We shot while the BREXIT vote was happening. It literally was. We all voted on the day that we filmed, one of the days we filmed. And even more complicatedly, Scotland -- unlike the United Kingdom voted to leave Europe, Scotland contrarily voted substantially to stay in Europe, 62 percent, and I think it's led to her, just yesterday actually, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, she triggered the next referendum, the process, the legal process by which there will be a second referendum about whether Scotland remains in the United Kingdom, which it was asked previously a couple years ago, and it just decided to stay in the United Kingdom. Now the question will be whether it's on the ballot paper or not -- on the referendum paper or not, is do you wish to be part of Europe still, because the rest of the United Kingdom is withdrawing from it. And I think Scotland will choose to stay in Europe rather than to stay in the UK. I don't think that the Scottish -- I mean I'm English, and I know the Scottish have never had any really great fondness for the English anyway. We've always been at wars with them. We've seen many times. And, actually, if anything, they have an affinity with the French rather than the English. And Mary Queen of Scots used to keep her armies in Scotland ready to attack England, so there's a history there, you know. 

You were dealing with guys 20, 21, 22 years ago who were young, up and coming actors. A number of them have become directors themselves. 

Yeah. 

So they're wiser about the game. 

Yeah, that's true. 

They sort of -- they might have their own opinions on ways things should be. 

Yeah. 

Does that make things easier or more complicated for you? 

Weirdly, I mean, it made it a lot easier. It's not so much directing experience, because I think that Ewan McGregor and Bobby Carlyle have both made movies, feature film movies. I think they were delighted not to have the responsibility of the directing, and they could just think about their character. Where you benefit from is their experience as storytellers, the four of them. They've done so many -- you know a director does maybe one film every two years. Actors can maybe tell four or five different stories in a calendar year, and you realize that they know shortcuts and they know how to help you in a way -- it's almost unspoken. It's almost automatic sometimes. And I did notice it particularly in comparison to when we made the first one, when we were all pretty much stumbling around not really knowing what we were doing, and we kind of got away with it. If you're lucky, you get away with it early days. We all know that experience of seat of our pants, you know, and all that kind of stuff. But now they're much more skilled, but they're impatient because they have the performance ready and they want to give it. And they don't want to be delayed by crews and by delays with lighting and things like that. So it was interesting, me and the crew, we had to really be on top marks, really, in order to capture the performances from them, because they're itching to give them, you know. 

I'm curious about how you pushed these guys now, because since they are comfortable in these roles. Are you still trying to put them in places where they're not comfortable? 

Yeah, a little bit sometimes. You do, after -- they're very brave actors, and certainly the first film, and this film, they're not like mumble core social realist performances. They're quite big and they're quite declared performances. So they're always happy to have a look at the extremes of the way to perform the character. So you can make suggestions like that. They have an automatic -- all actors have an automatic safety where if they sense they're overdoing it, they'll pull back anyway, a good actor anyway. 

But they have -- but it would become too easy for them, these roles; right, because these characters have just existed now for 20 years; right? 

Yeah. Although they were nervous, I think, about going back to them. 

Oh, they were? 

Yeah, initially would they be able to be Renton again or be Begbie again? And until you start doing it you don't know, of course. But the script was an excellent script and that filled them with a lot of confidence, really, I think. You feel an obligation obviously that you are not going to dishonor the past, both in terms of the original film, but also in terms of the tone, Edinburgh, and which was -- it played such a huge part in all our careers. And so the obligation you feel is not so much an ongoing nervousness about can I do it, it's will I do it well enough to make sure -- will we all do it well enough to make sure that we make something that's worthy to stand beside the original, you know. 

Welsh, you mentioned he wrote the sequel that came out a little less than ten years after his original book. He also wrote a prequel -- 

Yes. 

-- to Trainspotting. Has there been any talk of doing that in any way? 

He's very interesting. He visits these characters, and other characters associated with them multiple times in multiple books. And he's done a book "Skagboys," which is about their lives, their younger lives. And there's been talk about the television series in the new television world, you know, extended storytelling over ten hours and maybe multiple series. So there's been talk about that. He's also written an extraordinary book about just Begbie called the "Blade Artist," which is the most recent work he's published, and that is a wonderful book, very interesting. Not written like his other work. Very compact and thriller like. And I know Bobby Carlyle would love to do that. But that may emerge out of this kind of -- it's not really a character spin off like in the Marvel universe, but it's sort of the Trainspotting version of that, yeah. 

Begbie is still the toughest one to watch. 

Yeah. But don't people like him as well, in a way that you wouldn't think. 

You think? 

I mean not like him, like him, but, actually, he's funny. You laugh. You have a good laugh, and -- 

He's funny but -- 

You never want to be caught alone with him in a bar. 

Yeah. 

But he's very tender at the end. Didn't you find that? 

He was, yes. After being untender for -- 

For a long time. 

For a long time. I think it can be very difficult to watch him, because I just think he's -- because, I mean, they're all self-destructive in a way. 

Yes. 

But he can be self-destructive and violent. 

He's actually the most destructive of all of them, yes. 

Yeah. 

He's a very interesting actor, Bobby. He can access that in a terrifying way, and yet he's a sweetheart. But interestingly, he doesn't -- he doesn't go home to his family when he's performing Begbie because he thinks, in some way, that it's sort of -- he doesn't want it -- he thinks it's still in his clothes. This is how he expresses it; that there might be elements still around him that he can't -- that he's not aware of, and that he'll brush against his children in some way. So he always stays in a hotel when he's doing Begbie, which is not so good if you're staying in a hotel with him perhaps. 

I don't blame him. I think we have -- for the sake of his family, I think we have a Begbie clip. Relax, don't do it when you want to go to it. Relax, don't do it when you want to come. Relax, don't do it when you want to come. Relax, don't do it. Relax, don't do it when you want to come. 

Don't stop. 

Another example of Begbie willing to put himself in danger to hurt -- 

To hurt others. Particularly to hurt Renton, if he can. 

Yeah, to hurt someone else. It did surprise me that you did this, a little bit. 

It did, yeah? 

Well, only because you jumped around so successfully into different genres and never sort of have really been pegged into one movie or one film; right? And so that you would return to the same characters -- I don't know, it seems like you would almost -- like your wanderlust would just want to carry you somewhere else and you wouldn't want to go back necessarily. 

Except weirdly, of course, it became the biggest challenge of all, is once you broach the ideas is could you return to it and make something decent that would stand beside it? So it wasn't that you were going to repeat something that you knew you could do or that you were familiar with. And studios often want to hire you because they think you can do a certain genre. They think, oh, he's good at that, let's get him to do that. So it wasn't really that fitting. It was can we move it on. And 20 years is such an extraordinary timespan, because it's the perfect timespan for that telescope of time, where, depending on which way you looked in the telescope, it's either almost out of reach or it's on top of you still. And movies, this is one of the things I learned doing it, and it was so wonderful to do it, was movies are about time. I've never -- when we got in the editing, you realize what movies are, and it's the ultimate art form, is for the study of time, because all you do in the editing, and you know this in editing, you compress time or you extend it, or you make it vanish or you stop it or you start it again. And it's this control of time all the time over the audience's two hours of time that they give you that it's the perfect art form for. And you can literally -- and audiences, if they have a favorite film, and for some people Trainspotting is a very affectionate feeling, an image that they have of it. They have locked to actors in time, and I know that. I've done this with films where -- and know the actors make other films and they're aging over here, but I have that image of them there, and then you can go back to that image and just say, no, they're not mythologized. They're us. They're just like us. They answer time like we all do. You know, it's in the post for all of us. And men especially deny it for so long and so often and so vigorously, we try to kind of keep our backs turned to it. But you realize, ultimately, time doesn't care about you, and you have to make your peace with it somehow. So it was -- I couldn't think of -- there was nothing that I wanted to do more than it once we began working on it in that way, yeah. 

You mentioned the studios and how they want to push you a certain way, and, I mean, you've always resisted that, because you don't -- I think you don't want the stories to go a certain way, or you want them to go the way you think you can tell that story the best way. You're a Hollywood guy. You made a couple Hollywood movies, a couple of American films. 

Yeah. 

But it's mostly -- you'd rather keep the budget a little lower and keep the independence than take the bigger money and get told what to do. 

Yeah. I mean we make the films for a limited budget. It's still a lot of money, because it's usually somewhere south of $20 million, which is a huge amount of money in anybody's life. 

But compared to T2, you know, the other T2, you know, I mean -- 

Yeah. But he's a genius at handling bigger budgets as well. But I don't -- this is just a personal preference. And I love watching the bigger budget movies, especially James Cameron ones. But it's obvious, if a studio gives you $15 million they're going to be worried, but not as worried as the guy they're giving $200 million to. So inevitably you think, well, there's a big of cunning there, we'll keep them off of back as much as possible. And it's not a question of they're not the great evil ones. You want to work with them, and you work with some really good people in the studios as well. But obviously the financial concerns, if you ease them for as long as possible, it gives you freedom to express yourself in the way you want to do. And also, it's provocations like the first Trainspotting film, and there's elements within this, which are really tough choices that you make, which, in a mainstream film that costs a hundred million dollars, you probably wouldn't be wise to include, you know. 

No, probably not, once you see T2. The music, as was the case in the first one, is thundering and prominent, and this isn't just a movie, it's a soundtrack. 

Yeah. 

And so what kind of care in the selection goes into figuring out what makes it in? 

Oh, everything. I mean it's -- I'm a product of music, like so many of us are, the pulse war, really music, and by that, I mean pop music really, is a kind of liquid architecture that runs through our lives backward and forward, and it's defined us and it's sneered often by high culture as low culture. But, actually, for me, it's all culture. And, actually, these characters in the first movie, and in this movie, the music is as important to them and as their dialogue, as the scenarios in the scenes. It stands beside them as an equal character in the film really. And it sets off different emotions in people, which is one of the most extraordinary things about it, especially with this, because we try to trigger that a number of types that muscle memory you have of the first movie, yet you hear cords that you recognize from that first movie, and they're reemerging. We didn't just want to copy, you know, repeat the music from the first film. So it's been reimagined or remixed. But they do trigger emotions in you, which are, in movie terms, it's wonderful to do that, because it's not a conscious thing you're in control of with music. It affects you in different ways and to do with your own memories, often to do with those tracks, or you complement a scene or contradict a scene that you're watching, you know. So that one, you had "Frankie Goes to Hollywood," which is a great gay anthem, really, and it's a character in it, Begbie, who is taking a considerable amount of Viagra before that scene happens. But in the scene we're not allowed to show it on television, you'll have to go to the cinema to see it. You clearly see that his blood lust is excited by the fighting with Renton rather than the way he would conventional challenge it as you think. So you can have tremendous fun with the choice of music as well and trigger lovely connections with people, for whom pop culture is our culture, you know. For us all, we live through music, you know. In the younger generation you look for -- I mean we don't use Rhianna, but you look for a Beyonce, but you look how important it is in their lives. I look at my girls, and the importance of that music in their lives, it's huge, really, and deserves to be cherished as true culture, even if it's only three minutes long. 

A pleasure to see on screen, a pleasure to have you here, Danny Boyle. Thanks so much. 

Lovely. Thanks, Jeff. Cheers, man.
