When Ibsen wrote the play, A Doll's House, in 1879, he never imagined that it would become the feminist literary classic it is today. The play has been produced many times over, but for the first time Olivier Award-winning actress JANET McTEER reinvents the lead role of Nora. While some critics such as John Sumner (sp? ) of New York magazine have said that she may be a little bit over the top, most critics are going wild over her performance. Here is what chief drama critic for The New York Times Ben Brantley said in an earlier broadcast. (April 3, 1997) You just said to me as you sat down, about Doll's House-- 

Uh-huh. 

Repeat it for me. 

Oh, God! This is the sort of thing you shoot yourself for saying later. I'm still high from it. The woman who plays Nora in this, JANET McTEER, gave what may be the single most compelling performance I think I've ever seen on a stage. Again, it's-- it's a little like falling in love when you see a performance like that. You wake up the next morning, you're happy. But this was a play I thought I knew from top to bottom. I thought that it was creaky, that it-- I'd never really seen that part work from beginning to end. And what she does with it, it's like it was just written for her. It's-- it's so exciting! 

One of the extraordinary performances you've ever seen. 

Ever. 

Yeah. 

Ever. I mean, you think of all-- 

And Doll's House becomes fresh again. 

Totally, yeah. And it's-- I mean, the problem has always been, how do you make that final conversion work, where this woman suddenly becomes very articulate and says, ''I'm leaving you. This is what women do,'' and so forth. And she plays it like an actress who's worked too hard all her life and has suddenly just realized that she's been quite grotesque and is still sort of trying to figure it all out. 

So there! Welcome to the-- I mean, what do you think of-- hello? Shall we stop while we're ahead? 

No, that's fine. That's fine. That's a nice (unintelligible) 

Yeah. 

He wrote a nice review. 

He did. 

Well, he cottoned onto the thing-- you know, like, a couple of the things that-- you know, she's over the top, but she is. That's the whole point about the character I've made is that she's-- you know, that-- that she's-- I've created somebody who's acting-- 

Yeah. 

--and doesn't realize she's doing it-- 

All right. I want to get into-- 

--and then gets caught out. 

Okay. Let me-- I want to come back to that. But first, tell us the story of the plot, the sense of what did Ibsen-- what was Ibsen writing? 

Well-- 

Who is Nora? 

Nora was a real woman that he knew and, in actual fact, when she left, she was put into an asylum until she said she'd come back, but he decided not to write that. 

This was written in about what, 1879, 1880? 

In 1872, I think, yeah. And basically, I-- you know, I read everything that he'd written about it and he hated the fact that it was taken over as a feminist drama. And every time I'd seen the play, which is the reason why I wanted to do it in the first place, was I thought it fell apart because of the character of Torvalt, (sp? ) really, and because, you know, you can't have somebody coming back in as Emily Pankhurst, having been an idiot for all that time, to suddenly come in and go, ''I've seen the light.'' 

Yeah. 

You know, it just doesn't mean anything. It's ridiculous. And the character of Torvalt was always played as some crusty old fart that nobody would want to-- 

Yeah. Right. 

You know, and you'd just think, ''Oh, leave him!'' after the first scene. (crosstalk) 

''Why did it take her so long?'' 

''Come on!' ' You know, so when she finally comes back on, you just kind of say-- but basically, my whole take on it was that if you-- if you don't look at it as a feminist drama and look at it as a humanist drama, with possibly feminist-- you can draw feminist conclusions from it, then what you have is somebody who-- a much more flawed person, a much more flawed character, much more flawed relationship. And that stuff at the end-- it's all there. It's brilliantly written, I think. And you know, when-- as soon as she says, ''I don't love you,'' she then says, ''I'm terribly sorry. It hurts me to say it.'' I mean, she's full of doubt and I just thought that-- you know, that it was-- that's what happens when real couples break up. It doesn't matter if you think you're right or know you're right or whatever. Even as you're walking out the door, there's a part of you that-- 

It's hurt and saying, ''What am I doing?'' 

''What have I done?' ' And you're terrifyingly lonely, terrifyingly whatever and, you know, you always wish it could just be better just for a minute and it's-- 

Yeah. 

And that's what-- you know, that's what-- 

Let me just tell the story here. I think probably everybody has-- has read A Doll's House or has seen it performed-- probably more likely to have seen it performed somewhere. It is the story of a woman's awakening through the course of a marriage-- 

Yeah. 

--and finally, in a sense, finding out that she is somebody else or she wants something different-- 

Yeah. 

--or however. 

Yeah. 

And you just said your interpretation is that this was a woman who was not sort of necessarily saying, ''This is an emancipation for all womanhood''-- 

No, not at all. 

''What this is about is I was-- had a great sexuality with this guy''-- 

Uh-huh. 

You know? ''It was a marriage, but all of a sudden, I realized it was hollow.'' 

Well, I think it's-- the reason I think it's such a good play is because I think, like so many marriages, which is why I think people get so affected when they come and see our production, is that, you know, you start out sort of being horribly truthful with each other and it's all absolutely marvelous. And then somewhere down the line, you think, ''I just won't mention that. He's done it again. Never mind. I just won't mention it.'' 

Yeah. 

And somehow these little bits get chipped away. And then you have kids and then, you know, there's too much-- you're too busy with the kids and doing up the house and paying off the mortgage and blah-de-blah. And then there comes a point where suddenly something happens, a crisis happens, and suddenly you're looking at somebody and you go, ''I didn't think he'd act like that.'' And you've grown apart without actually realizing it because the fabric of your life is-- is-- 

Yeah. 

--the bricks and the mortar and the kids and the-- you know. But then, actually, the communication has failed. Somewhere along the line, you've stopped really talking to each other in the way that you do when you're first lovers and you're first together. And basically, that was our take on the play, which was that, you know, she-- basically, just to go over the story, as such, she's borrowed some money-- 

Right. 

--eight years ago to save her husband's life and not told him about it. And they've gone off to Italy. He's got better. Marvelous and marvelous. (? ) They come back and instead of telling him, which is what would have been the right thing to do, because he hates debt and all that sort of stuff, she then sort of makes a bit of this and she makes a bit of that and she doesn't spend all the money and then-- 

Yeah. 

--and she slowly pays it off. And at which point, the big-- he gets promoted and becomes a bank manager and is going to fire the guy who is the money lender and the money lender then blackmails her. And she's convinced that Torvalt would take the blame for her, so it would ruin his life and ruin his career and be such a scandal. The bank manager, you know, has been, you know, borrowing money from this terrible money lender, et cetera, et cetera. So that in order to do-- for her-- rather than let that happen, she's prepared to kill herself and run away, at which point, you know, Torvalt finds out-- 

Yeah. 

--and then goes absolutely-- you know. And she kind of goes, ''Hang on a minute.'' 

Yeah. 

''All of these things that I've done and I've done it for you,'' in the absolute certainty that what's kept them together was-- kept her kind of accepting all the things that he does that sort of-- 

Yeah. Yeah. 

--slightly annoy her or whatever and vice versa-- 

Yeah. 

--is the fact that at the end of the day, he's a really good husband and he'd do anything for her. And when she really needs him, he's just not there, at which point she kind of goes, ''How did this happen? How did I get like this? I don't know who you are anymore. I thought that you would do all these things for me. And actually, a thank you wouldn't go amiss. You know, I've done''-- 

Yeah. 

''I've spent all of these years hiding this secret from you.'' And finally, she realizes that she's-- again, going back to my take on it, she finally realizes that she's-- you know, she didn't have a mother and -- such a clever play -- so she's been brought up to be Daddy's perfect little girl-- 

Yeah. 

--and she's absolutely charming and she does all of that and everyone thinks she's marvelous and she's slightly potty and all of that. And it's-- she's such a delight to have around. She's great fun at parties and all of that. And then she gets handed over from him to Torvalt and then the same thing happens. 

She's his little child. 

Yes. And so suddenly, she kind of goes, ''I've done all of these things in secret, all my secret life, which was my secret self-esteem''-- 

Yeah. 

--''and it's gone. It's not meant anything. I've done it all for nothing. Who am I? I have no idea.'' 

And is she leaving, as you see it, to find out who she is? 

Yes, she's leaving because she doesn't know who she is, but she can't stay here because he's betrayed her so badly. She loved him so much. She loved him more than anything else in the world. She'd have done anything for him. And when she needed him, he wasn't there and she can't live with that. 

You come to watch this play in the first act and you see her moving around and-- 

Oh, yeah. 

And you're six foot, one. 

Yeah. 

Many people wouldn't have thought of you-- 

No. 

--as the right sort of-- 

Neither would 

--anatomical person-- 

No. 

--for the role. 

No. Neither did 

Yeah. You didn't, either? 

No, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not. I mean, I'd seen the play lots of times and every time I'd seen it, I'd sort of gone, ''The biggest mistake of this play is that they play it as the story of a woman. It's not. It's the story of a marriage.'' 

Yeah. 

And it's-- unless you get that marriage right-- you know, unless these people are in love with each other, unless she is so-- she loves her husband so much that, you know-- so Torvalt was the big thing. So I thought, ''I'll direct it, because I'm far too big and Bolshie to kind of play Nora.'' 

Yeah. 

And then I was asked to do it on radio-- 

Yeah. 

--and so I did it with sort of my ideas, like-- you know, and we had a young Torvalt and all of that. And then when I was doing it on radio, I thought, ''Actually, I could do this. It's not to do with being little, as a real person. It's to do with being made to feel little, made to feel small and made to be lesser than you are.'' And she's a person with no self-esteem at all, in the beginning of the play, and very little at the end. 

But-- well, what gives her what little self-esteem that she has? 

Is taken away from her, which is her secret-- 

Right. 

Yeah. And then he takes it away from her, at which point she falls apart and becomes even littler than she ever was at the beginning, at which point she then starts to get angry, probably for the very first time in her life, and then leaves because she just simply-- she's on the verge of a breakdown. 

When do you see in the play-- or when do you, as the principal actor, intend to convey she's beginning to change, she's beginning to rethink? 

I think at somewhere 'round about Act II. I think there's a very-- you know, there's an old saying, isn't there, that-- something about, you know, ''There's no''-- not ''Hell hath no fury.'' That's the wrong one. But something about, ''You'll never see anger like a woman fighting for her children.'' 

Yeah. 

And in a sense, that's what I feel like. There's a part-- a point-- some-- even though she gets more and more neurotic in Act II and more nervous and more frightened-- 

Yeah. 

--there's a point when Cruikshank (sp? ) comes back in and she's actually beginning to discover a bit of anger for the first time, a bit of ''How dare you do this to me and my family?'' and ''I won't let this happen to my family. I will not let my children's lives be ruined and I will not let my husband do this.'' And I think at that point, she starts to change and, at that point, I think also Dr. Rank (sp? ) starts to die and all this and-- 

Yeah. 

--I think she's partly kind of going, ''Excuse me, God. Where-- I mean, I was brought up to believe''-- 

Yeah! 

--''that it was all supposed to be nice. I've done it all right.'' You know, ''I'm wearing the right frock. I'm doing it all right. Where's''-- 

''What the''-- 

''What's going on?' ' 

Exactly. 

''What have I done to deserve this?' ' 

Yes. 

And it all starts-- 

''Why me, Lord?' ' 

Yes. Yes. And it all starts to fall apart. The little house of cards-- 

Yeah. 

--starts to crumble. 

You mentioned the first act. A couple of critics who have said something-- it's-- there's too much of this and there's too much of the-- the-- what-- 

Yeah. 

I wouldn't characterize that-- too much of the sort of-- 

The fluff. 

--the fluff and the baby talk and-- 

Yeah. Well, I mean, you see-- you 

What's that about, in your head? mentioned earlier on, before we started, about being a risk taker. I think the thing is, is that what I wanted to create -- and I knew it was a bit risky -- and what I'm really glad about is that people either have-- most people here, as you said, have really loved it-- Right. Right. 

--and a couple of people have gone, ''Oh, it's dreadful and she's awful!'' And I really like that. 

Yeah. Yes, you do! 

I really like it. What I don't like is mediocrity. 

Exactly. 

''Oh, it's an all right A Doll's House.'' I think I'd slit my wrists. 

''Love me or hate me, but don't''-- 

Yes. 

--''go in between.'' 

''No! Thank you very much.'' 

Right. 

So I think what I want to do is-- you know, there are so many people who you meet and you see them-- and particularly women, I think, and you see them and they present this perfect front and they present this fact that, you know, they don't really tell dirty jokes or they don't do this, that and the other and they always look good and blah, blah, blah, blah and-- you know, it's all sort of slightly not really real. It's a bit Stepford Wives. And when you knock 'em or if you crack 'em, by God, they come-- they've got gumption! 

Yeah. You bet. 

They really have and they're-- you know, and it-- you know-- 

Push them against the wall. 

Absolutely. And they'll be really splendid. And I know that from all of the generations of the women in my family, where I grew up, and I'm the big, noisy, Bolshie one, but they're not. The rest of my family are all sort of-- you know, they're real girls, you know what I mean? 

Yeah. 

They're proper girls and they sort of do all of that stuff and they wear nice clothes and all of that sort of thing. And I don't and never have. So-- you know, I don't wear frocks, you know? 

I can't imagine you in a frock. 

Well, I'm not really a frock kind of girl. And so-- but then-- you know, but they're such fighters-- 

Yeah. 

--and, by God, what they would do for their families. They're fantastic women-- 

Yeah. 

--all of them. But somehow they've been brought up in this world of men and in this world of men-- they pander to this world of men. 

Yeah. And that's the-- 

Oh! 

It's instinctively learned-- 

And that's-- 

--from the world around them. 

Yes. And they're filthy, these women! You get them on their own and they tell filthy jokes! 

Yes. Exactly. 

And they're so funny about when their babies were born-- 

Yeah. Exactly. 

--and things like that. 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Soon as there's a man in the room-- 

If men knew what women say-- 

Oh! 

--together-- 

Yes! And I wanted to create-- 

--they would be overwhelmed. 

--a woman like that. What I really wanted was I loved the idea of an audience-- 

Yeah. 

--going out at the end of Act I, going, ''She's a bit irritating.'' 

Yeah. Exactly. 

''I mean, I really kind of thought I was going to come and see this sort of embryonic kind of''-- 

Yeah. Yeah. 

--''bionic woman and she's just-- actually, she's just quite-- a little bit irritating''-- 

Yeah. 

--''and a bit kind of whatever.'' 

Right. 

And I wanted that to happen. And then, by the end of Act III -- don't ask me they're on your side. how I do it, but I know I do it every night -- They're hooked and they're with you all the way. And it's something to do with-- you know, theater is-- even if you're doing an incredibly naturalistic piece, which this is-- and it gets more naturalistic as the play goes on-- 

Yes. 

--you know? I personally, as a performer, love the idea of chucking somebody a very small, little piece of cotton and by the time you get to the end of the play, they're on a rod of cable and that you've got them and they just-- they can't get off. 

Yeah. 

And then they love you for it, you know? It's great because they've had a really thrilling time in the theater. And that's sort of what I wanted to do. I wanted-- I didn't want to pre-empt anything. I wanted-- every A Doll's House I've ever seen goes from sort of ''H'' to-- you know what I mean? 

Yeah. Right. Right. 

I wanted to go from A to Z, just to see if I could and just to see if we could, as a production, and as a marriage, me and-- oh, and myself-- sorry-- and so that was part of it. And then the other part is I think that you go-- even if you go and see the most naturalistic theater, it's still always heightened, so even though the end is unbelievably naturalistic, I still wanted the whole thing to be a slightly heightened version of what is really real. And the thing is, is that even though, yes, she does flap and she does all of those kind of things and-- but people do-- I don't know. People do-- 

Yeah. 

And also it's-- there's a part of it that just takes over. 

Yeah. But you're saying it's part of the-- 

And all of that stuff goes. By Act 

Yeah. 

--until-- 

That's right. 

--until Torvalt comes back in and them, in Act III, of course, it's not there at all. And again, I don't use my-- my natural voice, which is a big chest voice, until I-- you know, and I don't use my height or anything. 

It's kind of a high, squeaky voice at the beginning. 

Yes. And then I get-- you know, get in there with the-- with the balls! You know, it's really-- you know? 

Yeah. 

So it's-- 

And by Act 

Yeah. 

You're in fifth gear. 

Yeah. 

You are roaring. 

Absolutely. 

You're ready to-- 

Yeah. 

--to unload. 

Yeah. Yeah. 

You know? 

Yeah. 

How much does he and the way he plays the part help you get there? 

Totally. 

Yes. 

Totally. 

Totally. 

Absolutely totally. 

Because you, in part, were responsible for his casting. 

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Very much so. I mean, when-- you know, because I had this idea about the play and I got my producer drunk and said, ''We're doing A Doll's House'' and he (unintelligible) ''Oh, are we, darling?'' And I said, ''Yes, we are.'' ''Jolly good.'' And-- and then-- 

And then the next morning, she got up and said-- 

And then-- ''Janet playing what?'' 

''Surely she meant directing.'' 

Exactly. Yes. I think I (unintelligible) I managed to persuade her I was five foot, two, by a lot of vodka. 

Yeah. 

And yeah, so, you know, then we met Anthony and Anthony thought the idea was a good idea and wanted to explore it. And then we met Owen, whose work I-- I didn't know Owen before-- 

Yeah. 

--and I knew his work and I thought he was fantastic as an actor and-- and then we met and we just kind of kicked it off and there was great chemistry. And he-- he also thought it was a great idea to do the-- the thing about it being-- they're both-- you know, every relationship is symbiotic, every relationship is-- 

Yeah. There's a symbiosis in every relationship. 

Absolutely-- and that they're both complicit in it, so he's-- you know, this-- it's never made clear of what-- why he got ill. 

Yeah. 

You know? He got terribly, terribly ill. Whether that was T.B. or whether he had a nervous breakdown or whatever, you know, he was just working too hard and he couldn't take it and it's something to do with he needs her to be little and do all of these things and to make him feel like a big man. And he can't cope with anything that's not ordered and perfect. Even when he's drunk, he likes to talk about-- 

And does he know what's hit him as she leaves? 

I don't think so. 

I don't, either. 

I think he's beginning to realize that his world's falling apart-- 

Yeah. 

--but I don't think he's-- 

He has no comprehension. 

No, not really. 

And doesn't even know that he should have taken responsibility. 

No. No. And doesn't-- except he very nearly falls apart. 

Yeah. 

When his world nearly falls apart, he nearly falls apart. So between us, it's-- it's very symbiotic. And we chuck it about every night. 

And every good actress wants to play this part because of the-- A -- because it's one of the great parts for women and -- B -- the range of the emotional-- 

Yeah. 

--throw. (? ) 

Yeah. 

Is that it? 

Yeah. I don't-- I have-- I don't know. I just-- I think I wanted to do it because I thought it-- I'd never seen it done the way I thought it should be done-- 

Yeah. 

--so I thought, ''Well, I'll do it, then.'' 

Right. 

So I did. 

I want to talk about you, but first let's see some tape from this. This is from the-- this is where you return from shopping, the so-called-- 

Oh, right at the beginning. 

--first part of the play, and Torvalt chides you for spending too much money. And here is that scene. Take a look. 

Now, what do we call the little birds that like to fritter money all the time? 

(unintelligible) 

That's right. Well, this little fritter bird is very, very sweet, but she does waste an awful lot of money. Now, who would believe how much it costs me to keep that little bird? 

Darling, how can you say that? (unintelligible) Well, I try and save as much as I can. 

Yes, you do. You do all that you can, but you can't. 

Oh! (unintelligible) If only you knew how many expenses singing birds and squirrels have. 

Oh, you're a funny little creature. You really are. You're just like your father, aren't you. Oh, Nora. You try every trick in the book to get at money and then, when you do get it, it just slips through your fingers. You never know how you spent it. 

Well, I wish I were more like (unintelligible) 

What? No, no, no, no. You stay exactly as you are. I wouldn't want you any other way. You're my lovely little singing bird. 

Now, he-- don't you think-- I mean, if you look at this, having seen the whole play, you can see a little bit of it there. Even there-- 

Oh, yeah. That's why it's-- 

--you know, it's there. 

--such a good play. 

Yeah. 

It's just a tiny little thing and-- 

Yeah. 

--it's-- because-- 

The way you turn your head and you know-- ''It's not quite like that, Buster.'' 

Yeah. It's all of what it is. It's-- it's-- but I mean, I defy any relationship to-- you know, ''If he-- if he keeps wearing his socks like that, I'm going to divorce him. If he doesn't (unintelligible)''-- and we've all got them-- 

Yeah. 

--you know? And then sometimes they're just-- they're just a bit too far and you go, ''Darling''-- 

Yeah. 

I think they all have that. 

This is another scene. Roll tape -- in this-- which Nora tells Christina (sp? ) she's found the way to finance the trip to Italy herself, not by borrowing money from her father, as everyone believes. Here it is. 

It was me who saved Torvalt's life, Christina. I did. I saved his life. 

You saved it? 

Yes. 

How did you save it? 

Well, you know, the trip to Italy that I told you about? Yes? Torvalt would be dead if we hadn't gone there, you see. 

Well, yes. Your father gave you the money that-- 

No, no, no. That's what Torvalt thinks. No. No. Actually, that's what everybody thinks. But-- 

But? 

Not a penny from Papa. Honestly, not one. I found the money. I did. 

You? 

Yes. 

So much money? 

Four thousand, eight hundred krone. There you are. What do you say to that? 

Where did you get it? 

Well, let me think. 

Well, you couldn't have borrowed it. 

Really? Why not? 

Well, a wife is not allowed to borrow money without her husband's consent. 

What if the wife knows something about business, though, hm? What if the wife knows how you use her brains? What then? 

No, I don't understand. 

Anyway-- now, did I say I'd borrowed the money? Did I? 

No. 

No? Well, there you are, then, you see? Lots of different ways of getting money, aren't there. 

We'll come back to another clip, but let me-- York-- grew up in York? 

Yeah. 

Okay. How early did you know-- because at 16 or soon thereafter, aren't you on your way to RADA? 

Yeah. It's a bit of a potty story, really. I was-- 

A ''potty'' story? 

''Mad.'' 

Oh, ''mad.'' Okay. 

You know, balmy. 

Bonkers, yeah. 

Well, no, I'd never been on a state or anything. I'd never done anything. I did one school play, I think, when I was about 12 and I was a bit of a hit, and-- 

Did well first time out? 

Yeah, playing a boy. What a shock. And-- 

Because you were the tallest person around. 

Yeah. Exactly. 

Yeah. Yeah. 

And I think at that time, I was the skinniest, as well! And then-- so that was the only thing I'd ever done and-- and then I just always sort of felt like a fish out of water, really, where I grew up and-- 

You didn't know where you belonged-- 

Yeah. 

--didn't know who you belonged with. 

Yeah. And I-- and, you know, and you kind of think, ''Oh, that's quite glamorous,'' but I'm sure I-- that was exactly the same as every other teenager, to be perfectly frank. 

Yeah. Right. 

But anyway-- and then, when I was about 15 or 16, I got a job selling coffees at York Theater, for my Saturday job, you know, to earn-- 

Yeah. Right. 

--a bit of money. And that was why I wanted to do it. Nothing to do with the acting, because I'd never done it, but I met all of these people and-- 

Yeah. 

--I just thought, ''They're my kind of people.'' And so I thought, ''I'll direct a play because that's a proper job.'' 

Your kind of people because they just-- 

I don't know. They just felt comfortable. They felt like me. 

Yeah. 

They felt like people I could talk to and-- 

These are fellow travelers. 

Yes. Yeah. And so I used to-- they used to sneak me in to see all the plays and all of that and I thought, ''I'll direct because then I can get a job in a theater and have a proper job and,'' you know, ''and a proper wage and things like that.'' And then-- 

You didn't see yourself as Vanessa Redgrave. 

No, no, no. Not at all. And then when I was-- and then about-- that went on for sort of a few months and then I was watching She Stoops to Conquer one day and the lights went down and I got this buzz that I always get when I go and see a piece of theater-- 

Yeah. 

--and I just thought, ''If I don't have a go at this, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.'' So I came out and I said-- 

See, I think that's the greatest notion-- 

''I'm going to be an actor!' ' 

Yeah. When somebody says, ''If I don't do this, I'll regret it''-- 

Oh, yes. 

--''the rest of my life.'' 

Life's too short. 

''If I don't take this step''-- it's back to what you and were talking about, the risk-- 

Yeah. Yes. 

--factor in those-- 

Absolutely. 

--of us who say-- 

Life's too short. 

You know? 

It really is too short. 

''If I don't jump on this train, it'll never come back maybe.'' 

No. Absolutely. I have a-- you know, I sometimes take students, young students who have just left college and stuff-- 

Yeah. 

--and work with them and help them out and-- 

Workshops. 

Yeah, that sort of stuff-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, at the National in London. And I do that for fun-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, to just kind of make them feel like the people who are, you know-- and I always have one thing I always say to them, which is what I thought even then, and I don't know how. I don't know who was looking after me, but-- which was that somebody's got to succeed. There's no reason why it shouldn't be me. 

Exactly. 

And I-- so I went to drama school and I got into drama school having never been on the stage. 

But what (unintelligible) 

Seriously. I had gotten-- 

Did you audition? 

Yes, I audition, and I got into RADA and-- 

Yeah. Right. 

--and I'd done one school play when I was 12. That was it, the sum total of my acting. And I remember I-- 

Well, what did they say? I mean-- 

They said, ''Why didn't you ever tell us this?'' 

''You lied to us.'' 

Yeah. They said, ''Where did you rehearse this? Who gave you lessons?'' And I said, ''Nobody.'' 

Yeah. 

They said, ''Where did you rehearse this?'' 

So what does that-- 

I said, ''In my bedroom.'' 

What does that say to you? 

I don't know. I think-- 

I mean-- 

--I've had a few sort of major revelations in my life and that was one of them. 

That ''I can do this.'' 

Yes. That sort of instinct, where you kind of go, ''That's what I want to do!'' 

Yeah. And what are the-- (crosstalk) What's another revelation in your life? 

Doing A Doll's House. I literally-- you know, one day I woke up and, you know, decided to do it on radio-- 

Yeah. 

--did it on radio, then went out for a drink with my producer, who happens to be one of my best friends-- 

Yeah. 

--and said, ''We're doing it next year, by the way.'' Didn't even think about it. And that was it. The rest is ''Here we are now.'' 

And you've done Uncle Vanya and you have done-- 

Yeah. 

--Shakespeare, Much Ado-- 

Yeah. Yeah. 

--and you desperately-- I mean, ''desperately'' is not the right word. You very much want to be Cleopatra. 

One day, yeah. 

Well, how long do you have to wait? 

I don't know. 

But it's not like Lear, having to wait to be old enough to be Lear. 

No, no, no. But I mean, to a certain extent, if it-- this sounds absolutely terrible. I don't mean it to sound terrible, but, you know, I'm 35 now-- 

Right. 

--and I've played virtually all the great classical women that I can play of-- of-- you know? 

Uh-huh. 

I'd quite like to leave myself a few. 

So it's a sense of not doing everything now? 

Yeah. You know, there's a part of me-- 

Yeah. 

--that goes, ''Well, you can play it''-- I mean, in actual fact, Cleopatra died when she was 28. I could play her now. 

Yes. Exactly. 

And I might. You never know. 

Yeah. 

But there's a sense that kind of goes, ''Well, why?'' 

Does-- 

''Why play her now? Play her when you're 40.'' 

Yeah. We first got to know you because of Portrait of a Marriage. You played Vita Sackville-West. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. You-- do you want to be a movie star? 

Do I want to be a movie star? 

And let's assume that Meryl Streep is a movie star. 

Yeah. 

And let's assume that-- 

Yeah. No. Yeah. I mean, the-- 

--people that you admire-- 

Yes. 

--are movie stars. 

Oh, yes. Inasmuch as there are certain people I think are absolutely sensational and who, you know, I would absolutely die to work with and to the sort of films that I would like to do, like Streep and-- 

Yeah. 

--Susan Sarandon-- 

Right. 

--those kind of people, you know, and-- oh, yeah. In that sense, I would. Absolutely. But I went to-- I went to L.A. once when I was about in my late 20s and I just hated it. I thought I was-- 

What, a fish-- 

--too tall or-- 

--out of water or just-- 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

No, I just thought I was too tall and not pretty enough and all of those kind of things and I just thought, ''Oh, sod it. I'm going home.'' But now that I'm here, I don't feel-- if somebody offered me one, I'd jump at the chance. 

Now that you're here. 

Yeah. Exactly. 

Yeah. 

Now that I'm here, you know, yeah. 

Yeah. 

But of course, you know, if there's anything for sort of a leading lady in Britain-- 

Yeah. 

--it goes to Emma Thompson, so I don't go looking. (crosstalk) 

I mean, if there's a great role, her fingerprints are on it. 

It's true. Yeah. Oh-- 

If they show you the script-- (crosstalk) Yeah. 

Yeah. So, you know-- 

Yeah. 

But yeah, now I'd love it. 

Yeah. 

I'd love it. I want to-do an action movie. That's what I really want to-- 

You do? 

Yes, I do. I want to be in a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I'm his biggest fan. I really am. I think it's because I spend my whole life steeped in culture, you know, steeped in all this-- 

See, we want what we are not. You know that. 

Well, exactly. My idea of a great Sunday is at least three Arnie movies. Chuck in a Sylvester Stallone movie. 

Yeah. 

And I'm just, like (unintelligible) 

And what it is, it's just different? 

It's because-- 

It's what you're not. 

Yes. It's-- I want to be in a boys' movie. I really do. I do. I want to-- 

This is going to be easy. You know-- 

--be trained and have-- 

--that. Now that you've-- 

--big muscles and do all that and-- 

Now that you've said this, this is easy. You are also tough. I mean, there is a sense to read about you, nothing pleases you more than dinner at your house and a very good conversation-- 

Oh, yeah. 

--where you can play the opposite side of whatever. You can take the contrary position. Yes? 

Sometimes. No, I prefer to-- I just like to hear other people's opinions. 

Yeah. 

I love talking to people who have opinions that are different to mine, not because I wish to change their minds, but because I wish to-- 

The engagement. You like-- 

--learn something that-- 

--the engagement that-- 

--I might-- yeah. 

All right. 

I mean, you know, the-- it's great. And I think the older you get, the more opinionated you get, so it's really nice to meet people who have different opinions because then you have to challenge your own opinions all the time. 

This is old news. Not married. 

Not married, no. 

No children. 

No children, no. Nephews. 

Left the Catholic church to become perhaps something else. Yes? 

No, I was never-- 

Or-- or Church of England maybe, whatever it was. 

The church-- the Church of England, yeah. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. No, I'm not a Christian. 

Not moving towards Buddhism or-- 

Well, I suppose I'm more Buddhist than anything else, but I wouldn't say that I'm a Buddhist. 

Yeah. When does this end? 

When does what end? 

A Doll's House. 

July the 27th. 

Why such a short run? 

Because otherwise I think I'd go mad. 

Yeah. Because-- 

I mean, if you think about what I have to do every night-- 

I know. I don't know how you do it every night. 

Yeah. I mean, neither do I, to be perfectly honest. 

Do you have to-- you really have to-- and when you get up in the morning, every day is a count-- every-- every minute, every hour is a countdown to going-- 

Absolutely. 

--on stage because of these-- 

Oh, yeah. 

You're on stage for every moment. 

Apart from one scene, yeah. 

One scene, yeah. 

And even then, I'm doing a quick change and having a cup of a tea and a quick pee. 

A quick pee during that time? 

Yeah! 

Yeah. 

I fit it all in. 

Yeah. And you do not have a plan for where you're going to be when you leave this-- 

No. I'll tell you what I'm not doing. I only know that I'm not going to cry! If it says, ''She cries! Page 4''-- no! 

Is that right? 

Yes. That's-- you know-- no, I think I'd like to be here for a while. 

Yeah. 

I love it here and I have a Green Card and-- I don't know. I just love it here and-- 

Yeah. 

--I've wanted to come here for quite a long time. I was going to come here last year and then I didn't and then we were doing-- 

Yeah. 

--A Doll's House and I was working, doing some other stuff. And now we're here and it's a big hit. It's so exciting. And great shopping and all of that sort of thing. I love it. 

But people don't recognize you, I suspect. 

People don't even recognize me when I walk out the stage door. You know, my fellow comes and picks me up-- 

It's the hair or-- (crosstalk) 

I don't know. And every night we walk out the stage door and every night there's people there and every night I get embarrassed because every night-- 

And they say, ''When's Janet coming out?'' 

''Is the tall girl with''-- you know, and I'm-- (crosstalk) 

Getting on your motorcycle! 

Yes! And they-- and they just-- and you just think, ''How many six-foot birds are there walking out this door?'' 

Not that many. Right. 

And they just don't, no. 

Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for coming. 

Thank you very much. 

Great to have you. I love the play. It's extraordinary and-- 

Thank you very much, indeed. 

--it is really what acting is about. You do see the spectrum of a performance there and-- and the other characters are very well as-- are good, as well. Thank you very much. 

Thank you very much. 

JANET McTEER. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you next time.
