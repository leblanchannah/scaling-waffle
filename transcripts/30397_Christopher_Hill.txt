Tensions with North Korea continue to rise this week, and so does the rhetoric. Vice President Pence was in South Korea where he promised an overwhelming and effective response to any use of nuclear or conventional weapons by the north. And North Korea's state-run media threatened a super mighty preemptive strike that would reduce South Korea and the United States to ashes. Joining me now from Denver is Ambassador Christopher Hill. He's a former ambassador to South Korea. He headed up the U.S. delegation during the Korea nuclear talks. He's now the dean of the Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. Welcome, Chris, it's great to have you here. 

Thank you very much. 

I have in my hand the new 100 most influential people from "Time Magazine." They announced today that among those people is the leader of North Korea, Kim Jung-un. And guess who they asked to write the profile of Kim Jung-un? You. So tell me what you said about him because everybody wants to know, you know, who, in fact, is he and what should we expect from him. 

Well, he's been in power some five years. And there doesn't look like there's any mellowing of his position. He has really accelerated the nuclear program. In 2016, he had two nuclear tests. It's widely believed he's going to have another one very soon. He's had some 25, 30 missile tests. And it's believed that that will just continue through the year. And meantime, he's gone on, how to put it, a bit of a murder spree. He's had executed over 300 people, usually in public executions by firing squad. He's thrown in flamethrowers and other things. In short, he does not appear to be any kind of reformer as some people thought he was. And indeed, he's proving to be a very irascible, difficult leader. The Chinese can't deal with him. No one can deal with him. And yet, we have this looming crisis to deal with. So I think this is something the Trump administration is going to have be to seized with for some time or they'll come to 2020 and have to explain to the American people what all happened. 

How would you deal with him? 

Well, I think first of all, it's essential to have a serious discussion with the Chinese. And by serious, I mean not just about, you know, whether they'll comply with some sanctions, regimes, which they do need to do. But a serious understanding that if North Korea were to go down by whatever means, we would not in any way try to disadvantage China's strategic interests, we would not be putting troops up in the -- and other things like that. So we need a really serious deep dive with the Chinese. Secondly, and this is part of why we've seen Vice President Pence and Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis recently in the region. We need to reassure our allies. I mean, I was just in South Korea a few days ago. There's a lot of concern not only about the North Koreans, but also how the new U.S. administration is managing this. 

So with respect to him, based on what you said, I mean, can you expect to have a reasonable agreement that satisfies the interest of both countries? 

Well, you notice I talk about what we have to do with our allies there, and I talk about what we need to do with China. But I'm not sure there is really a scope for negotiation at this point with the North Koreans. I mean, they agreed to give up their nuclear weapons. And then they abandoned what they agreed to. And now they would like to talk to us, of course, but as one nuclear power to another. So I'm not sure that's really going to lead us anywhere. I think we need to have a serious, closer understanding with the Chinese. In particular, we need to set some priorities with the Chinese. And I think, frankly, President Trump said it best when he said I can't start a trade war with them when we're trying to deal with this tough issue with North Korea. How we deal with it, what are the elements of it? Probably in the space between peace and war, probably along the lines of trying to slow down their program through some sort of clandestine means. But meanwhile, really try to put the screws to this regime because it is truly intolerable and it's not getting better on its own. 

But you do not, I would assume, recommend some kind of military strike at this point, or some kind of effort to change regime in North Korea? 

You know, if there were means to change the regime, sure. I mean, it would not be a bad day if we all woke up and found that he was gone. But I think when people talk blithely about military strikes they need to keep in mind the fact that our ally there, by far the most important country for us in the Korean peninsula, has some 20 million people of its population, some half of its population within artillery range of the North Koreans. So to talk about somehow having some punitive attack on the North Koreans, similar to Syria, or using some enormous bomb similar to the one we saw last week in Afghanistan, is really to invite the question, would they retaliate? And if they do, we are pretty much treaty-bound to go after them as well. And so before you know it, we're in a second Korean war. If people want to do that, they ought to think through it and know that that's exactly what they're doing. So this idea there's some quick military solution to this, I think it's not quite accurate. 

You were in South Korea. What do they want us to do? 

I think the South Koreans want us to be in close contact with them. They want us to understand that we can talk about what we want in places like Washington. But when you live some 20 miles from North Korea, you need to be pretty sober about what you're saying. I think they would like to see us talk to the Chinese and have an understanding of how we might cooperate to alleviate the pressure from the North Korean regime. Again, I don't want to talk about coups and things like that, but we need to have an understanding with China that North Korea, as it's presently constituted, is not a stable element for the future. And I think the South Koreans would like to see that, but with one caveat. I don't think they want us going and talking to the Chinese about the future of the Korean peninsula unless they are part and parcel of the thoughts that go on in such a conversation. In short, I think their mantra would be nothing about us without us. 

Is that a reasonable idea for them? Clearly, it is. Is that a reasonable idea for the Chinese and for the United States? 

Well, I think it's a very reasonable idea for the South Koreans and for us because we're allies. And if there is a perception in South Korea that we're cutting our own deals with the Chinese without them involved, I think that would very much weaken this alliance, which I think has stood very well since the end of the Korean War. So, I think from their perspective, it's vital. I think the Chinese have to kind of over the years they've kind of learned that they no longer have tributary states around them, they have sovereign countries around them. And I think they need to take that a little more to heart and understand that we cannot do things without the South Koreans in accord with what we're doing. Now China and South Korea have had a good relationship over the years, but the way China has gone after South Korea for the fact that South Korea and the U.S. agree to put in an antiballistic missile system, the way China has gone after South Korea, tried to punish them is really not a good way to treat neighbors who, after all, are going to be there for the next thousand years. 

I assume they're against that because they think it questions their own use of weapons if they should find it in their national interest to do so. 

Well, I think from China's point of view, putting in the so-called terminal high altitude area defense system, so-called THAAD, it has a very robust radar, and the Chinese are worrying that, although nominally it's there to deal with the North Korean threat, it could ultimately get some information against China, such that it would diminish China's own deterrence. So the Chinese worry about those kinds of things. But if they want to worry about it they ought to talk to us about them, and the South Koreans, not just try to make life miserable for the South Korean state, which after all is going through some tough times. The president was impeached and now in prison. They have an election coming up on May 9th. These are tough times and it's very important that we hold the South Koreans close. And it's very important that China understands that South Korea is a very stable element on the Korean peninsula and one that they should welcome should they become their neighbor. 

And with respect to the election on May 9th, who's likely to win, and is that person likely to accept the previous policy with respect to the United States and South Korea? 

Well, right now it's quite a horse race. There is a candidate, Moon Jae-in, who is the chief of staff to Moo-Hyun, who is the last leftist, left of center Korean president. Moon is known to harbor kind of a view that somehow we are not doing enough dialogue with the North Koreans. And he has a kind of sympathetic ear for the North Koreans from time to time, or at least that's his reputation. So what is happening is as North Korea has continued to threaten South Korea, and by the way, these threats to turn it into ashes, goes along with the sea of fire threat a few years ago. But, so, the more North Korea threatens them, the more it helps the other candidate, his name is Ahn. And so, Ahn, has kind of drawn even in the polls even though he does not represent this left of center option, he's more in the continuity of the President Park Geun-hye now awaiting trial in prison. So it's a bit of a horse race. We don't really know how it will turn out. But it's all the more reason why the U.S. needs to be very careful in managing it because we don't want a situation where the South Korean public kind of turns on us. And while, you know, it is true in life that 50 percent is showing up; in diplomacy, the other 50 percent is following through. And we have a government now in Washington where Rex Tillerson is essentially home alone at the State Department, he goes out and talks to people, but there is very little follow-up. And I think that needs to be addressed as well because it's not enough to go and talk to the South Koreans and leave, and they sort of wonder what's next. 

When you travel around the world and certainly when you travel in Asia to South Korea and Japan, what are our allies thinking about President Trump? 

Well, you know, if you take the totality of President Trump that is starting with reality show Trump and then going to candidate Trump and then now President Trump, there is a lot to be concerned about in terms of statements that seem, how to put it, not to have been fully staffed or thought through. So there is some concern among our allies about what kind of -- what will the alliance look like going forward. And so I think it is really behooves this administration to get its adults out there in the field, whether it's Secretary Mattis or Secretary Tillerson. But they also want to see sort of a follow-through and they would like to see some continuity. I think the Trump administration has spent a lot of time stressing that there will not be continuity with previous policies. And it's kind of hard to hear them talk about a situation in Korea without somehow acting as if the problem here is Barack Obama rather than Kim Jong-un. And so that worries people because they would like to see more continuity from us. They don't have the concerns about Trump that many people in the U.S. do. They think he might be a strong leader. They welcome strong American leadership, but they would like to see that strength accompanied by knowledge and wisdom. 

Then there's the element of predictability or non-predictability, unpredictability, seems to cut both ways. Some suggest it has its advantages, if you change your position and it's unpredictable where you may be next week. On the other hand, as you suggested, predictability is something that allies depend on. 

Yes, it's a delicate game. You want to kind of make your adversaries sort of wonder what you are going to do and sometimes the creative ambiguity as Henry Kissinger used to talk about it, is I think valuable. But on the other hand, they want some predictability. They want to know what our real interests are, how we look at them long-term. And when the administration spent so much time repudiating anything that went on before. I mean, it was quite remarkable to hear the vice president speaking in South Korea about -- or decrying the Obama policy as strategic patience. But he also linked that to every other president before. So I think there is a lot to be -- there's a lot that they are worried about. And there is a lot of diplomatic work for this new administration to accomplish to deal with that. 

Do you think they meant to say we're no longer patient? 

Yes, I think the idea was look, being patient, of course they put the word strategic to convey a kind of wisdom in being patient. But I think the idea is to say that kind of strategic patience hasn't gotten us anywhere and we need to deal with this issue. It's not -- I don't think the Trump administration is trying to say we're done with talking, we need to move on to some military solution. I think they're simply saying we can't let this issue bedevil us for the next 20 years as it has done for the previous 20 years. And by the way, I share that view. I think the fact that North Korea is getting very close to a deliverable nuclear weapon is something that we have to be very concerned about. I am not in a position to say with 100 percent certainty that they wouldn't use such a thing. And I think North Korea looks at their nuclear arsenal not just in terms of regime survival, as some apologists for them suggests, but rather I think they look at it from the point of view of how can we split the United States from these alliances, from Japan and South Korea? And so they could put the United States in a position that unless you back off, we may use this arsenal against you. And of course our comeback is we will obliterate you. But is that a good enough trade to obliterate North Korea in return for an American city? And if you are a U.S. president, you may not look at it that way. So the stakes are very high and tensions are very high. And we need some real serious thinking and serious approach to this. And we're not going to be able to do it without our allies as Secretary Mattis wisely suggested. 

But also China, we have to have China to become engaged, and to change, which raises one question about China. Did -- is there anything that you know that came out of the meeting in Palm Beach that suggested a different kind of or an evolving relationship with China with respect specifically to North Korea, perhaps also to trade? 

I like to think and maybe this is a triumph of hope over expectation, but I like to think that they had a serious discussion in which they put North Korea at the top of the agenda. I think like in everything, you have to set priorities. And I think too often in our conversations with China, we've gotten into this sort of desultory list of issues with no real issue rising to the top. So I think North Korea did rise to the top. Now it's not easy to find a way forward. You know, people often talk about how the Chinese are worried about issues like refugees. Well, that's probably true. But they're also worried about what happens if there is a North Korean demise? What is the perception? Is this going to look like an American victory, a Chinese defeat? There's a lot of this kind of zero sum thinking going on in China. They worry that if you lose this last Marxist-Leninist Bastion, how will that affect the internal discussion within China about China's own internal system? So there is a lot of -- there is a lot of different opinions about China. It really shouldn't be said that a country with 1.4 billion people has one opinion on something. So in this lack of consensus in China on these issues, there's been a lack of resolve and a lack of clear policy going forward. And I think maybe President Trump may have helped to focus them on what needs to be done. And suggesting to them look, we're looking very carefully at this, we're not looking at trade wars or other things right now, so we'll have to see how this turns out. But I really think they need to do this with more of a team than they've got fielded right now. 

And the Secretary of State needs more help. Back to the question about dealing with the Chinese. It's a long way from Mao, the present Chinese leadership and the present Chinese economy, so it's less Marxist-Leninist is one thing. The other thing is that Xi Jinping has an election coming up with the congress, and will meet with the congress, Chinese congress in October or November. And he wants to change the nature of his own government, who he puts on the standing committee, and that kind of thing, a kind of strengthening of his own authority. And therefore, he doesn't want any problems between now and then, correct? 

That's absolutely correct. And to use an American political term, for Chinese, North Korea is a wedge issue. There are people, especially among the security services, who feel this is a historic ally. Obviously, their system that they have in North Korea has little similarity to the system they have in China although they both call them communist systems. But the concern is that somehow if you let this old historic neighbor go down, you kind of started the unraveling of China. So there is that view. And then you go to other parts of China and people have no patience with dealing with North Korea. They would like to throw them under the bus in a New York minute. But there are, opinions are split and for Xi Jinping to kind of come out on one side or the other, invites more controversy just as he's trying to consolidate his power. So there is no question these domestic factors in China loom very large, as they do in any great power. They certainly loom large in our country. 

What do you make finally of this controversy about the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson? 

Well, on one level, it looks like a sort of confusion of talking points between the Pacific command, the Pentagon, the White House. On the one hand, it looks just sort of bureaucratic snafu, maybe related to some of the lack of staffing. On the other hand, it has a look that maybe our president was trying to sell something that wasn't quite all there, for he suggested that we would have, he used the term armada. 

Right. 

Normally used for the Spanish armada some 500 years ago, but he used that term, okay. And he implied that that would be somehow part of last week's solution in terms of getting North Korea to back off. And then we find that it was -- it had things to do or exercises to do in Australia and it wasn't going to be deployed for some time. And so I guess the problem is when you are president and you say something, and even if you think you are saying something accurately, people need to be able to take that to the bank. And I think the whole operation there has to be very -- has to be really tightened up to make sure there is not the kinds of confusion that has kind of emerged in the last couple of days. Because the next time he says something, will people believe him literally or will it be some sort of figurative notion that, oh, at some point, we'll get an American ship up there. 

I got you. This is the last paragraph of what you wrote about Kim Jong-un. "Initial hopes that the Swiss-educated, third-generation dictator would be a reformer and accede to international demands to abandon his nuclear program have long died along with his victims. There are no good options for stopping Kim, but cooperating with China and reinforcing alliances with Japan and South Korea is a start." Chris Hill, great to see you, thank you for joining us. 

Thank you. 

Chris Hill from Denver. Back in a moment.
