Bernard-Henri Levy is here. He is a philosopher and author, a filmmaker and a friend. His new documentary is called "The Battle of Mosul." It takes viewers on the front lines of the fight to recapture the Iraqi City from ISIS. Here is a look at the trailer. (GUNFIRE) (MUSIC) (MUSIC) (GUNFIRE) (GUNFIRE) (MUSIC) (GUNFIRE) (MUSIC) Levy's earlier film "Peshmerga" was selected for the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. It focused on the Kurdish militia's fight against ISIS in Syria. I am pleased to have Bernard-Henri Levy back at this table. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

So what is it between you and the Kurds? 

A sort of love story, but a political love story. They are so brave. They are so liberal. And they are such an exception in this area. They are pro-West. They practice equality between women and men. You have women fighting in the same battalions as the men. They are tolerant towards the other regions. You showed this image of this Christian church which has been vandalized by ISIS. It is Muslim Kurds who put the cross back. And they are very valiant. I had the chance and the honor to escort them, to go with them on the front lines. I could be a testimony for their bravery. For the atrocities of the war and for the bravery with which they confront this war. 

So in "The Battle for Mosul," they are fighting at the same time as Iraqis are fighting, other Iraqis from the Iraqi army. How do they get along together? 

There is a coalition with also western forces -- 

And with American air support. 

Air support, ground support. I met some American officers, American special forces. They are in the movie. They are on the ground. French also. It is coalition of men and women of goodwill against barbarity. It is a coalition. In this coalition, there is a share of tasks. The Kurds have part of the job, they open the gates of Mosul. They liberated older villages around. And the Iraqi army is dealing with the battle inside Mosul. I followed both of them. I was embedded or I signed up in a way with my camera, with both the Kurds and the golden division of the Iraqi army. 

Do you now care more about making films, documentary films, than you do about writing books about those experiences like this? 

It depends. This war, I had the chance to be a firsthand witness. I had the chance to be taken really with my team -- on the very front line. I felt the duty to see what I saw, to show what I saw. And this could not be shown in a better way than with a documentary. You have to see these women wounded to death. You have to see this population of Mosul surging from the ruins with hunger. You have to see these women sniped when they get the little food, the snipers from the roof who snipe them. You have to see this ruined city, the Kurds and the Iraqis, they fight and liberate a ruined city. This is so heartbreaking. It is the same in Berlin in 1944, 1945. It repeats today. 

Why do they fight? 

They fight for us. They fight for themselves first of all, for their families, for their country, but also for us. They are the Kurds and the Iraqi army. They are our boots on the ground. And they have really -- all the Kurds with whom I spent night and day, told me, we fight and live in it. We fight for civilization. We fight for values of freedom. The famous question of Capra in 1943 in America. Why do we combat? Why do we fight? The Kurds ask the same question and they say, we fight for freedom, we fight for America, we fight for France, we fight against Jihadiism. And this is a great thing to see. Muslim, because they are devoted Muslim, they are pious Muslim, they are true Muslim, fighting against radical Islam. This is a great experience and it is a great proof that the battle is not between the West and the rest. 

It is within Islam. 

Inside the rest, inside Islam, within Islam, between two conceptions of Islam. I am proud to have escorted, to have filmed, to have shared some experience with these liberal and democratic Muslims who are the Kurds. 

How do the Kurds in Iraq differ? How do they differ from the Kurds in Syria? 

In a way, they are the same. They are brothers. The heart of every Iraqi Kurd beats at the same pace as the heart of the Syrian Kurd. But of course, as in all great peoples, there are some political differences. In Iraq, the Peshmergas, who are the ones whom I followed, are probably more pro-West. They are probably -- in Syria, there is some remnants of Marxism-Leninism of before, so there are some political differences, but they are Kurds. And they share these great patriotic hope of a nation for the Kurds. 

How does the United States handle the issue that we support some of the Kurds which drives the president, former prime minister of Turkey crazy? 

America is right to support the Kurds. We are -- you Americans and we French, we are supporting our brothers in arms. And our brothers in spirit. 

He sees them as terrorists, in some cases, as terrorists who want to take part of his country back, part of Turkey back. 

The Kurds I saw, the Kurds I accompanied in the war, I can tell you, are not terrorists. They are again -- 

Terrorists with respect to, a different definition than ISIS, for example. 

Certainly. But for the moment, they are those who fight ISIS. They are those who fight for our values. For example, I give you one example which, for me, is a little test. The relationship with the Jews in the Muslim world, this is a real test, the relationship with the Jews. In Kurdistan, it is the only place in this part of the Muslim world where relationship with the Jews and with Israel is a pride, not a shame. I remember one day, I was taken by my little escort to a village. I did not understand why it was far from the front line. They knew that I was interested in the front line, that I was there to film the front line. They insisted to bring me to a village of Ikrit. When I arrived in this village of Ikrit, I understood. They wanted to show me a place of great pride for them, not sacred but very honorable, which was the house where was born a former defense minister of Israel. So you have the Muslim country where the birthplace of a former minister of Israel is not something which they have to hide. 

Do you remember which defense minister it was? 

Yes, Yitzhak Mordechai. So I know a lot of Muslim countries where this sort of place would be hidden as a sort of shame which has to be forgotten. There, it is something which has to be praised and shown to a visitor. It makes a big difference. Maybe it doesn't please Mr. Erdogan, but for an American citizen, for a French citizen, it makes a very big difference. 

So you have the Kurds and you have the Iraqi army and you have the American army all fighting. How long will it take them to completely retake Mosul? 

I cannot say that. I really -- I made my point of honor in this film to show what I saw, as I saw it, and when I saw it. So what is happening now, I have no special insight. My feeling is that it will take some more time because ISIS are fighting in a coward but desperate way. 

Cowardly but desperate way. 

Yes, they are cowards, of course. They use the weapon of cowards which is suicide cars, which is human shields, hostages. They use children which they put on the front line. Disarm the children which is a shame. But they are the back against the wall and they will fight 'til the end. The battle which began now is in very tiny and narrow streets where the Humvees, in which you just saw my team in the trailer, cannot enter. No Humvees, no tanks, no armored weapons. It has to be taken house by house so it will take some time. But they will be defeated. And it will be very important because Mosul is important for two reasons. First of all, it is a biblical city. It is a biblical home of evil from 3,000 years ago 'til now. And number two -- 

Biblical home of? 

Of evil. 

Evil. 

Evil, yes. 

Right. 

And number two, it is the capital of ISIS. All the terrorist attacks which did hit us in the last month or years, have their brain in Raqqa in Syria, or Mosul. So this battle is absolutely crucial for the civilization, for America. 

The next target after that is Raqqa. 

The next target would be Tal Afar, first of all. Tal Afar which is a city in Iraq where there is a lot of, a big part of the leadership of ISIS, and after that, Raqqa, yes. 

Put that on. Yes. 

And we are going to enter in Fasliya? 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. (GUNFIRE) 

My great friend, it's great to have you here on the program. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
