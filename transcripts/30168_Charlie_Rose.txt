Kristin Scott Thomas. Stay with us. Katharine Clifton 

After studying drama in Paris, Kristin Scott Thomas landed her first film role in the singer Prince's 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. Since then she's established herself as a kind of epitome of British restraint in films like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Angels and Insects and A Handful of Dust. But it is her role in The English Patient that is bringing her extraordinary attention, earned her a Golden Globe nomination, a probable Oscar and praise from film critics like Janet Maslin of The New York Times, who said, ''The English Patient sets off sparks with the grand entrance of Katharine, (sp? ) played by Kristin Scott Thomas in a great, career-altering change of pace.'' Joining me now Kristin Scott Thomas. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

With that introduction. Let me just jump right into the movie itself, though. You read the book where? When did you first read this book? 

I read the book in Romania. 

You were making a film in Romania? 

I was making a film in Romania, a film with a very interesting director called Lucien Pantine. (sp? ) 

Yes. 

I didn't know if you've seen The Oak? 

I've not seen it, but-- 

That was a really great film. 

Yeah. 

Anyway, I was making that film there and desperate for sort of all things exotic and warm and sort of, I don't know, opposite of Romanian. And I read this book and got to the end and was so devastated at having no more pages to turn that I just went back to the beginning. And I did this three times. 

You read it-- 

I read it three times-- 

--three times? 

--cover to cover, yeah. 

And Katharine said what to you? 

Katharine said-- you know, Katharine-- Katharine wasn't really why I loved it so much. Why I loved it so much was the imagery and the-- and it was really Hana and Kip. 

Yeah. That affair. 

Yeah, because Katharine, in the book, I find she's sort of ghostly and-- 

Yeah. She's more-- 

--not really there. 

--seductive and more something else in the film. 

Well, she-- yeah, she-- but no, she has a really strong passion and really strong sort of-- what's the word? She's really vibrant in the book, but she's not really there. Or perhaps I didn't see her. Maybe it was on purpose. 

Yeah. 

I don't know. 

Then why were you desperate to play her? 

Well, because then I read the screenplay and what Anthony had done in his adaptation was to make-- it's more like a brother or a sister to the book, rather than an adaptation of it-- 

Yeah. 

--because he has altered things in it and he's-- he brought out from the dark-- he brought out from the sort of dream world-- 

Yeah. 

--Katharine Clifton and that suddenly she was there, you know, on the page with you and that's when I-- that's what I must do in this film because I just wanted to be part of it. I didn't know, you know, to what-- how I could possibly be involved in this film because I wasn't right for Hana. You know, what could I do? 

Yes. 

And then there was Katharine. 

Tell me about Katharine, though, because we're going to see you as Katharine. What-- how did you see her and how did you change as you began to prepare for the role? 

That's such a difficult question for me to answer because these things, I-- I saw Katharine-- I don't know how I changed at all. I don't know how I got to where-- all I seemed to be doing, as far as I was concerned, was saying the words and saying the words in the right environment with the right clothes, with the right person answering me and the right person pushing me onto the stage. 

Yeah. 

It was as simple as that. I-- there was quite a long process of actually getting to the first day of shooting, like the things I read. I read a bit of-- a bit about the desert -- you know, not much -- and a bit about women exploring the desert and-- 

Yeah. 

--women of that period and things. And I just felt I wanted to play someone who was-- who just opened up, who was just open and assured and confident and-- 

Here's what-- 

--sunny and up and-- 

Yeah, and wanted everything. 

And wanted everything. 

Everything. 

That's the only thing I have in common with her! 

You want everything. 

Uh-huh. I think so. 

Do you? 

Well, you try. I think-- 

Yeah. 

--most people do. They just don't admit it. 

But you've got most of it, don't you? You have a marriage. You have two kids. 

I have a lot of things that-- 

You have a role that has catapulted you-- 

Yeah. 

--to where you'd like to be. 

Yeah. And I've got lots more things to do. 

Why do you think this film has captured such-- other than performance and other than good direction-- I mean, Janet Maslin-- 

I think-- 

--and all the film critics I had here unanimously -- unanimously -- when we looked at films for 1996, selected it number one. 

I just think that it's-- it's a story-- the book was the same. Well, the book did it for me, anyway. There was something so intimate about the writing and through the writing, that became the screenplay and that became what we say to each other-- i.e., the action that's happening on the screen. And I think that it's-- it's so-- it touches everybody. There isn't one person-- I don't know. I mean, there may be, but-- 

Yeah. 

When you go to the film, everybody has different moments in the film where they just think-- a moment of sort of enlightenment-- 

Yeah. 

--and that's when-- 

It's like-- 

That's-- ''He's talking to me! He's talking to me''-- 

Yeah. Exactly. 

--''about me and my life.'' 

Yeah. ''He knows me.'' 

And there's something sort of-- 

''He knows my experience'' or ''His experience is''-- 

Yeah, just sort of intimate, but that just sort of applies to everybody. It's extraordinary that the subject and-- and then, of course, it's so beautiful and I think we really need that kind of beauty to be reminded-- 

Yeah. 

--about how-- 

It has almost an epic-- 

--beautiful the world is. 

--quality because-- 

Yeah. 

--the small, intimate story set against this larger background-- 

Sure. 

--of the desert and the war. Roll tape. Here is a clip from The English Patient. 

Why did you follow me yesterday? 

I'm sorry. What? 

After the market you followed me to the hotel. 

I was concerned, a woman in that part of Cairo, a European woman, and I felt obliged to. 

You felt obliged to? 

As the wife of one of our party. 

So why follow me? Escort me, by all means, but following me is predatory, isn't it? 

We were talking about this attraction between these two people while we were watching that. He's attracted to her because what? 

I think it's because she's-- she just-- she's the only one who actually dares tease him like that-- 

Yeah. 

--and see through him and see the child there is standing there, this child that's stomping through the desert, collecting things to stick in his book. 

Yeah. 

And I think that-- that he's just-- he just can't resist. And I think he's probably a terrible playboy when he gets to Cairo and-- this I get from the book-- 

Yeah. 

--that he hung around in bars and things like this. And so-- and this woman, who is so unattainable because she's married to somebody else-- 

Yeah. 

--because she's-- she's sort of glamorous and comes from England, where everything's sort of organized and-- 

Yeah. And in the end, an act of betrayal for her is unacceptable? That's why she can't-- 

I think it's-- it's more than unacceptable. It's just-- it's-- 

Unimaginable? 

Yeah, it's-- she just cannot-- she's physically incapable of coping with it. I think she just feels completely-- she's the sort of person who would always be able to find her center and find her balance and then this-- this thing that happens to her and she gets drawn, irresistably drawn to this man, sets her off balance and she just can't bear it, I think. And the love for her husband is something that is so-- so strong and has been there forever. She's always known this man. 

There must have been-- I assume, to make these kinds of things work, there has to be some kind of chemistry. I mean, you and Ralph had something. I mean, Anthony said-- 

Definitely. 

--that he saw you almost like two thoroughbreds who were quite-- as you peeled away layers, there was always more, and unrestrained and all of that. I mean, there-- it was like these two people, in the end, in terms of the actors he had. 

I think that the-- the thing that made it work for Ralph and me, and I think for all the other people in the cast, as well, is that we were both passionately in love with the story-- 

Yeah. 

--and these characters and that it-- I so wanted to be-- to be Katharine Clifton and he so wanted to be Almasy that we were both sort of completely locked into this little-- 

''To be,'' meaning what? You mean you wanted to make sure you fully-- 

That we-- that we-- 

--filled the vessel-- 

That-- 

--that is them? 

Exactly. Yeah. And that it was-- that it could be seen to be-- that the end result, that what we were going to give the director and the editor to put together was going to make the characters that we wanted-- would want to see-- 

In a way, is-- 

--and want to believe in. 

Is this the film experience that you'd always dreamed that filmmaking would be about? 

Yeah. Sometimes it's like this. It's been like this a couple of times. 

Where else? 

Well, this Romanian film-- 

Yeah. 

--that I made that-- 

Where you spoke some Romanian, I hear? 

I spoke all Romanian. 

All Romanian. 

But learned like a parrot, you know? Not very-- 

Yeah. Right. 

Not particularly clever. And I think, also, in Angels and Insects, there were some times like that which were-- we just felt that the piece was just flying and it's some-- it's to do with the director and it's to do with your partners and how much you all want to do the same thing and how much you are prepared to tell the story-- 

Yeah. 

--as honestly as you can. 

Here's another scene-- English Patient. Take a look. 

This is not very good, is it. 

No. 

Will we be all right? 

Yes. Yes. Absolutely. 

''Yes'' is a comfort. ''Absolutely'' is not. 

That scene-- what was funny about it? 

Well, this was a scene that we did for the audition and I remember sitting there on this sort of bench thing in this office and starting off the scene and saying, ''This isn't very good, is it.'' And Ralph goes to me, ''It is. You're doing fine!'' And I was so angry-- 

Yeah. 

--because, you know, I don't-- 

Because you knew or because-- (crosstalk) 

Because I was-- I was doing the scene. I was-- 

Yeah. Oh, yeah. 

--acting. You know, ''This isn't very good, is it.'' And he thought that I was being insecure about, you know, what I was doing and he-- so I felt that he must have thought that it wasn't very. Very complicated! But I-- (crosstalk) 

--reassuring you or whether he was-- 

Yeah, he was reassuring me or something terrible. 

Yeah. She represents freedom, we said. 

Uh-huh. I think so. 

She really does represent somebody who-- 

I think she represents freedom simply because she's so sure of her own-- her own needs and her own-- where she is and who she is that she can just about do anything she likes because she-- she can-- she has this, as I said, this sense of balance, so she can-- she'll always come back to-- 

Center. 

--to center. 

To foundation. 

So she can really-- I mean, she can-- she can really do what she likes and say what she likes and that's what I love about her. 

And she assumes she can always come back, there will always be a place for her because she's so-- something. 

Because she's so something. I haven't quite found a word yet. 

Yeah. All right. Roll tape. This is a scene with Ralph. Take a look. 

You sew very badly. 

Well, you don't sew at all. 

A woman should never learn to sew and if she can, she shouldn't admit to it. Close your eyes. 

Makes it harder still. When were you most happy? 

Now. 

And when were you least happy? 

Now. 

What do you love? 

What do I love? 

Say everything. 

Let's see. Water-- 

Uh-huh. 

With fish in it. Hedgehogs. Hedgehogs. 

And what else? 

Marmite. (unintelligible) And baths. But not with other people. (unintelligible) Your handwriting. I could go on all day. 

Go on all day. 

About you a little bit. When you-- rowing up in England, knew that you wanted to be an actress when? 

Well, it sounds awful, but I mean, I can't-- I've always wanted to be an actress. I can't think of a time when I didn't want to be an actress. 

Why? 

I don't know. I suppose it's just showing off. 

Really? 

I don't know. I don't know. 

I mean, was it somebody on the screen that you said, ''That's who I want to be and that's what I want to do and''-- 

I don't-- I don't-- I don't know. I-- I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, I was-- I was brought up on sort of T.V. and-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, and terrible sitcoms about children running away from home with-- getting horses and-- I don't know. And all that sort of thing seemed so wonderful and I-- you know, I was always-- I-- as a child, I used to write stories about other people the whole time, so I don't-- I don't know. Maybe I was just-- 

You had an imagination. 

I had a bit of an imagination, yeah. 

Yeah. And then you leave when you're 17 or 18 to go to Paris. 

Yeah, which was-- which people say to me often, ''What a brave thing to do'' and I think, actually, it was rather a cowardly thing to do. It was-- 

Because you had been rejected some way that you-- 

Well, I had wanted to be an actress and never really dared tell anybody about it, never really dared admit to wanting to be an actress. And then I managed to get myself into a drama school where I was doing a teaching course. 

Yeah. 

And I was miserable. I didn't want to be a teacher at all, but I had managed to persuade them that I did and so they gave me this-- this place and I was just miserable there. And it was so difficult for me to be amongst all these people who were actually trying to become actors and-- and I just thought, ''No, I can't be here anymore,'' and so I went off to Paris to sort of sulk and then I just stayed. 

And what was the break? 

Well, my-- 

You got married. You had two kids. 

Well, I had-- I got married 10 years ago this year, yeah, but the-- I think my first big break was-- well, it was. I mean, it was when Prince found me for-- 

How did he find you? 

Well, that was because he was making a film in the south of France and he was casting to find young girls to play the kind of-- young girls. And I turned up and-- 

You had the look. 

Yeah, I had the look that he wanted and he said, ''Well, have you considered-- would you like to read for the lead?'' And I said, ''Well, yeah.'' 

''Of course I''-- yeah. 

And so I did and that was that. Then suddenly I was being whisked off to the south of France in limousines and having manicures and things. 

Yeah. 

I'd never even stayed in a hotel before I took that, so it was all very, very new and-- 

And you were what, 20? 

I was 22 or something like this-- 22 or 23, something like that. 

Yeah. Have you stayed friends with him? 

Yeah. 

Really? 

Yeah. 

And you've gone through all the sort of-- 

Yeah. 

--permutations in his life. 

Well, I haven't a clue. 

Yeah. 

I don't know how-- what to call him. I just-- 

Yeah, I don't, either. 

I just sort of grunt. 

What is his name today? Yeah. 

I kind of grunt when I say-- 

Yeah, grunt. 

--it on the phone. 

Yeah. But you became friends and stayed friends. 

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Yeah. There is about you a sort of extraordinary but not just ambition, almost like Katharine, to do everything, yet at the same time, there's something else there. I mean, ambition is not all of it for you. 

I think-- I think it depends what you call ambition. I mean, there's an ambition to be an important actress. 

Yeah. 

But there's also an ambition to be someone who stays at home and-- 

Yeah. 

--looks after the children and-- 

Yeah. 

You know, but, I mean, there's just two things that I-- and it's all a question of keeping them in balance and sort of juggling. I mean, I'm a juggler. 

Yeah. 

I'm not really an actress. 

Angels and Insects-- what did that do? 

I loved making that picture. I think it was one of the best experiences I've had working on a film, working with a director, very closely with the director, working very closely with the other-- we were really a group making that film and that really gave me the taste of what it's like to work as a group. And that's what we found when we made English Patient, as well, is everybody working the same direction for the same thing. 

Yeah. 

That's a really great thing. I loved that character dearly. She's one of my favorite-- favorite characters. 

Because? 

I love Antonia Bart's (sp? ) world. I love her universe-- 

Yeah. 

--the dark and detailed and-- and these-- the strange things that she writes about, like the wrists and all these things that I found again in Michael Ondaatje's writing, a sort of-- it's interest with odd parts of the body and-- 

Yeah. 

--strange imagery that-- that-- I really love that. 

Take a look at Angels and Insects. Here it is. 

All right. All right. Tell me. Since you invite the question, how old are you? 

I'm 27. I've one life and 27 years of it are past and I intend to begin living. 

Not in the rain forest, not in the Amazon. The place is very much an inferno. 

But you will go there. 

My work is there, Mattie. I know how to live that life. 

I can learn. I'm strong. I'm resourceful. I have not (unintelligible) contrary to appearances. (unintelligible) me once the voyage is over. 

It's a daydream. 

No, it is what I will do! 

Mattie-- Miss Crompton-- (sp? ) 

Up here at night, there is no Mattie. My name is Matilda. Look at me! 

I have looked at you. I've seen your wrists, Matilda. 

I only wanted you to see me. 

I don't think that was all you wanted. Shall I stay here or shall I go back now? 

I should like you to stay (unintelligible) comfortably. 

Yeah. Tell me about the actor. 

Mark Rylance. He's a theater actor and I-- I think the director is the right title. I think he's the director of the Globe Theatre-- 

Of the Globe Theatre, yeah. 

--in London now. 

He might not make another film again? 

I don't know. I mean, I-- he might take a long time to make another one. I think he found it a very frustrating experience. 

Because he wasn't in control? 

No, I think it was because he didn't find that there was enough time and-- 

Yeah. 

He's very, very detailed and-- but he is an extraordinary actor, yes. 

You have no idea what you would do if you weren't an actor, no idea, because you wanted it-- 

I'm afraid not! It's terribly sad, isn't it. I just-- I think-- the more I work on films, the more I love it and the more I think if I had to stop being an actress for X, Z reasons-- 

Yeah. 

-- I would like to do something in film. I'd love to be an editor. I think that's where it all happens, actually. 

For many of them, it does, in the edit room. 

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

Yeah. This is Four Weddings and a Funeral. Most people -- most people-- you know what I'm going to say-- think, can't comprehend why your character and the performance you gave didn't make you inevitable the one to be chosen. Here's the film. 

My name's Fiona. 

I'm Gerald. 

And what do you do? 

I'm training to be a priest. 

Good lord! Do you do weddings? 

No. No, not yet. I will, though, of course. Jolly nerve-wracking. 

Yes. Rather like the first time one has sex. 

What-- well, I suppose so. 

Though rather less messy, of course, and far less call for condoms. 

You haven't seen that in a long time. 

No, I haven't seen that for ages. 

Yeah. What film have you missed that you very much thought was just perfect for you, a character? 

It's so funny. It's such a funny question because my answer is that I-- the ones you miss, you just forget them very quickly. 

Yeah. There's no obvious. 

None that spring to mind. I'm sure there will be and I'll get-- 

Katharine would have been there if you hadn't-- 

Oh, Katharine! It would have been impossible. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to play Katharine. I really don't. I think I'm-- I think I might have really-- 

Yeah. 

--gone and done something. You know, I would have done a sitcom or something after that, I think, if I hadn't done that. I mean, there's nothing-- and it would have been a completely different-- I would have taken a real U-turn-- 

Yeah. 

--if I had-- if I had lost that part. 

How hard was it for you, and difficult for you, because of your own personal experience with your father and stepfather, to be there with-- 

It was very hard, actually. It was-- 

Your father and stepfather-- 

--not easy to-- 

--both pilots who-- 

Yeah, but I-- it was-- 

--were killed-- 

I knew that that was one of the reasons the book appealed to me was this-- pilots crashing and-- 

Yeah. 

--all this sort of thing. I mean, obviously, it's pressing the right buttons, you know? 

Sure. 

And I really didn't think how that was going to affect me when we were shooting because I thought, ''Oh, come on. Don't be silly,'' you know? ''Get your act together.'' 

''You're a professional.'' 

You know, ''You're a professional. You're grown up now.'' 

Right. 

You know, all that sort of thing. And really, actually, I think, to be in the plane that crashed-- I found that terribly difficult. I'll tell you, the worst thing that I had to shoot, I think, was, surprisingly enough, was dying. I thought dying for the movies was going to be easy. I mean, it happens such a lot, you know? 

Yeah. 

Lots of people die in movies. And that was really terrible to do because-- it wasn't so much the dying, it was just-- it was sort of sustaining the hope-- 

Yeah. 

--that, you know, he's going to come back and fetch me. And that I found really hard. That was a real ''go home and blubber.'' 

Yeah, and I thought about that, too. I mean, to be in a cave alone and not to know, and it's almost like a flickering light, which there was. 

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It was very, very frightening. 

Yeah. 

Very, very frightening. To play somebody like Katharine with so much-- who is so self-revealing-- I mean, not-- who is somebody who-- the other characters I've played, like Fiona, who you saw in Four Weddings, and Mattie in-- 

Right. 

--Angels and Insects, have all been characters who've been hiding behind things and sort of keeping everything quiet, under wraps, until-- 

Painfully so. 

--D-Day-- 

Yeah. 

--and then at a given moment, they will then reveal all, and their secret-- their personality that they've been hiding for many years will sort of be released. But Katharine is not like that at all. She comes out with everything showing, you know, all guns firing. 

Yeah. 

She's there. 

Right. 

And you know-- 

When she comes off the plane-- 

--you like it or you don't like it. 

--and-- and-- 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

And to be able to play that self-confidence and-- 

Yeah. 

--sort of-- and kind of openness, somehow I had to get to that myself. 

What's next? 

Don't know, either. 

You don't know? 

No. I'm keeping-- 

And that's good? 

I'm keeping things sort of open because-- I'm driving everybody mad, I know. 

You mean agents, friends-- 

Uh-huh. Yeah. 

--people who are waiting for you-- 

People who-- 

--to make a decision. 

People who are wanting me to-- and I-- just want to go very gently now. 

Is it important for you now to choose extremely well? 

It's very important to me to choose extremely well because now I've made this film and it's getting the-- it's getting the-- whatever-- you know, people are loving it and it's working very well and it's-- it's so good to do that. I can't tell you how-- how many times I've made a picture, for example, my Romanian film, for example, which is a tiny little film, you know, and it's so sad when people don't go and see it and-- 

Because you think it's-- 

Because I-- you know, I believed in it and now I-- and I really believed in The English Patient and it's like-- we all did and-- and here is the film that we thought we were making and it's working and it's just the most thrilling thing and I-- and I want to do this again. 

Find another one. 

Yeah, I want to find another one that I believe in and that then will work. 

What do you fear the most? 

Sort of-- I fear-- I don't-- I don't know. Kind of mediocrity, I think. But you know, that's-- even admitting that is pretty dangerous, I think. 

Because the bar is higher now. 

Because the bar is higher and-- yeah. 

More is expected. 

More's expected and-- more's expected by other people. More's expected by-- from-- by myself-- 

Yeah. More-- 

--for myself, whatever. 

Yeah. You demand more of yourself. 

I demand more of myself. 

They demand more of you. Yeah. Thank you. 

Not at all. 

A pleasure. The English Patient-- Kristin Scott Thomas. Thank you for joining us.
