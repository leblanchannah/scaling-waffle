Forest Whitaker is here. Over the past few decades, his impressive roles in front of and behind the camera have yielded powerful films. Here is a look at some of his work as an actor and as a director. 

Listen, if I don`t get to my class, there will be a bunch of Vietnamese speaking in short, choppy sentences. 

Look, we`ve got to talk and we`ve got to talk now. 

Not now, man, come on. 

I can`t believe you. 

What? 

You`re going to leave (inaudible) leave everything (EXPLETIVE DELETED) hanging. People are depending on you. In the fire of spring, the winter garment of repentance fling. The bird of time is but a little way to flutter. And the bird is on the wing. They`re not going to let the guy out, and you`re going to have to kill me. 

They`ll let him out. 

You want to bet? 

I`m not a gambling man. 

And even if they do it, you can`t just let me loose. 

Why can`t we? 

Not your nature. 

Yes, nice meeting you. Hope to see you again real soon. 

Oh, God, I hope he`s not watching me walk away. 

All right. 

He`s watching. 

I don`t know how I treated you in high school. I`m guessing it was pretty bad, seeing how you`re hell bent on putting me in my place right now. That`s OK. Just put me in a job too. 

I`m afraid that I`m going to be standing by, and my men are going to shoot some guy, and when we find out what he has in his hand, we have to turn over his dead body and we see the thing that he was threatening people with, we realize that it was just a little black Bible. 

Or a cell phone. 

Do I have to remind you how many rungs detective falls below lieutenant on the department ladder? You get your ass out of that chair, and (inaudible) before I open an subordination file on you and put your picture up on my wall. 

In his latest picture, "The Last King of Scotland," he embodies former Ugandan President Idi Amin Dada. Here is the trailer for the film. 

How many doctors do you have here? 

Well, there`s me and now there's you. 

You seem an unlikely candidate for this kind of work. 

I want to make a difference, you know. 

I wear the uniform of a general. But in my heart, I am a simple man. I am you. 

What`s going on? 

The president wants to see you now. 

You are British. 

I`m Scottish. 

Scottish? Why didn`t you say so? This is the sort of man a president needs around him. 

You want me to be your physician? 

I want to introduce you to my wife. I want you to have some fun. 

Have you ever known to devour your enemies? 

Eating my enemies? I eat chicken. 

Do you have any idea what`s going on in this country? They`re not even bothering to dig graves anymore. They`re simply feeding them to the crocodiles. 

Nicholas, tell me what is on your mind. 

I have to go home now. 

You cannot. You are like my own son. 

I`m Nicholas Garrigan, and I`m from Scotland. 

Your home is here. 

He`s changed, hasn`t he? 

He`s always been like this. You have to find a way to get out. 

(inaudible). These are lies. 

They are going to kill us, Nicholas. 

Tell the world the truth about Amin. They will believe you. You are a white man. 

I will not die. You have grossly offended your father. 

Forest Whitaker has also recently made notable appearances on FX`s "The Shield," and has an upcoming story arc on NBC`s "ER." I am pleased to have him here back at this table. Welcome back. 

Good to be here. 

Good to see you. 

Great to see you. 

I read this part about this, that the director, you know, had in the beginning real reservations as to whether you had something within you that was right for Idi Amin. 

Yes, he was concerned about the reservoir of anger, or whether or not I could play the big largeness of the character that he was envisioning, the brutality, really. And so I had to actually do a work session with him. I had to do really what`s another term for an audition. 

What did you do? Just to convince him that you had that within you and you saw it in the character? 

I did, like, two scenes for him, I believe. And I had worked the night before with a dialect coach, Bob Easton. We were working on that. I wasn`t sure. Can I pull this off in a day or so? And he thought I could. And finally I just said, OK, I`m going to go in and do this. It worked out. It worked out. 

Tell me about Idi Amin. 

Wow, that`s a big question. 

I know it is. But-- 

Yeah. 

He`s a guy who had an impressive record in the military. 

In the military. Yeah. He was born up in the north Uganda, in Arua. And then he joined the army. And during that time, he also became the heavyweight champion of Uganda for about nine years. And he rose from really a private in the King`s African Rifles upward to corporal. They sent him out to Sandhurst to train. He was one of the two people they chose. They loved him. He was one of their best soldiers. 

Sandhurst is a military college in England. 

Exactly. That`s like their West Point. 

Right, exactly. 

And then he studied with the Israelis paratrooping. And slowly, he continued to rise because of his success in battle and because of his nature. People loved him. And so he became the head underneath Obote, the general, the chief of staff there. And when he went away, he was informed by the British that he was about to be arrested by Obote because of his popularity. He came back to the country and took it over. And then from that point, he tried to help the country, but slow decline through fear, anger and feeling isolated, he started to commit a lot of crimes, brutal crimes against the people, and like maybe 300,000 people died. 

Just atrocities. He saw them as -- why did he do it? You explained in just a minute. He thought they were his enemies. He had -- he was paranoid. 

No, it`s true. 

Saw conspiracies everywhere. 

But the thing is, I think there were some conspiracies too. I mean, I just think that he just got them blown out. He was easy manipulated. He was a soldier, you know, he was not a politician. He went in office thinking maybe I could make a change. And in African culture, when you`re the father of a place, a patriarch like that, it`s a great responsibility. And he took it on. I think the British misunderstood. They thought they were able to control him up to that time, but him being the father was a problem. You know, and so now he`s surrounded by the former president, all the people and countries around. Then the British won`t help him. So he finally kicks them out. He kicks the Israelis out. The Americans leave. And he`s surrounded, he thinks, by people who are trying to destroy him. And it just starts to escalate from there. 

There were assassination attempts, too. 

There were assassination attempts. There were like 11 camps around Uganda trying to take him over. And he did have legitimate reasons for thinking that people were trying to destroy him. But I think that because of his lack of political savvy, you`ll see that in the Barbet Schroeder documentary, there`s one point where he tells his cabinet, you know, look, if you see a traitor, just kill them you know, tell me later. I can`t do everything. You know what I mean? It`s the lack of political savvy that happened and naivete, not realizing what it would have, the power of even his word at that time. 

And there were people who surrounded him who only wanted to stay in power and did not care about anything else. 

And they were authorized in their way to act with autonomy. They were able to do all kinds of things. 

Now, let me just do the arc of his life. So there was the -- we`ll talk about it later, in which the plane was kidnapped, the Israelis came in and rescued their people and lost Benjamin Netanyahu`s brother was killed in that raid. Jonathan Netanyahu was a great Israeli hero, was killed, shot in the back as they were leaving, actually. He was the commander, he was the lead for the raid. Then he escaped, had I read 30 mistresses, four or five wives, a retinue of people -- to a neighboring African country. Yes? 

Yes, but then he went over to the Middle East. 

Saudi Arabia. 

Yes. 

And they gave him refuge. 

They gave him refuge. Because he didn`t actually take money from the country or anything. So they actually took care of him, and gave him a place to live. 

Why did they do that? 

Well, when you start to watch, you know, look at him during the middle, at first he was really close with the Israelis. Very close. He was (inaudible) with Golda Meir, close with them, he`d visit there often. But then he wanted arms. They wouldn`t help him. They got in all these disputes, and he kicked them out. He became close with Gadhafi and close with the PLO, as you`re talking about, and the whole Middle East. He was a Muslim, you know. He would make frequent trips there. You know? And so it was only natural at the end that he would go seek refuge there, because even when he kicked the Israelis out of their embassy, he allowed the Saudis to take that position. 

So then he ends up -- so he dies -- he tries to come back after he`s in exile in Saudi Arabia. But he`s stopped. 

You mean by the -- well, see, what`s really interesting is because when the country was taken back, there was a number of consecutive leaders that didn`t work out. You know what I mean? And then finally Obote gets over there again, and you know obviously he`s like testing the waters to see if it`s possible for him to come back and retake the country and take his position. But mainly, in the end, he just lived quietly, really. He only did I think one interview. Someone told me it was two, but I only know of one interview in Saudi Arabia. And he loved the press. He was dealing with the press all the time. 

So here is this guy, who has a certain charm, who has a certain style. Who is a bit larger than life because of size. 

Yes. 

And yet at the same time, there is this whatever, caused him to order, be involved in, permit these extraordinary atrocities. You can`t dismiss them by saying, well, a lot of other people killed more people than he did. These were crimes in the name of the state. 

They were crimes. 

So how do you get your hands on one hand this awful criminal, and on the other hand this engaging character, who had charm? 

But I think -- I think there is a key there. I mean, we can`t dismiss him by talking about the other people who have done that, but we have to look at the character and nature of some of those people. And they have to have a certain degree of charisma in order to be able to capture a country, to capture a nation, to be followed with the kind of devotion that`s necessary for them to take over a country like that. That was I think one of the key elements to his character. And in fact, it was a key element to why the press never really reported for long periods of time about what was really going on in the country. Because they were just seduced by this man, by what they would consider his buffoonery or his parties or his charm, what he was wearing. 

And do you think they didn`t take him seriously? 

I think they didn`t. I don`t think he was taken seriously in the beginning enough -- from the beginning, from the first moment the British maneuvered to get him into the presidency to get Obote out, so they wouldn`t have a communist country. They were concerned about having a communist country. There was this communist bloc forming there. And I think they thought, OK, he was a soldier, he`s followed us all these years. He`ll just do what we tell him to do. He`ll just -- we can control him. 

And he was an independent spirit. 

Yes, wasn`t right. And I think they underestimated him then, they underestimated him all the way through. 

Here is a scene from "The Last King of Scotland." We`ll tell you why the movie is called "The Last King of Scotland" when we return, but here is Forest Whitaker`s Idi Amin. Take a look. 

I am Idi Amin Dada, and I want to promise you this will be a government of action. There will be new (inaudible), new laws and a new focus! I may wear the uniform of a general, but in my heart, I am a simple man. Like you. I know who you are and everything that you are. I am you. Ask my soldiers. All my life, I never eat food until my soldiers have eaten first. It would be like this in Uganda now. Together, we will make this country better. 

You know about this speech. You know a bit about this speech. It has all the power of a successful demagogue. 

Yes. 

This is the way he talks. I never eat until my soldiers eat. 

Yes. 

You have the power. I work for you. That kind of stuff. 

Yes. And in the beginning, that is like -- this speech is from his early -- in the beginning, when he first was taking power. And he actually -- because he wasn`t the president first. He was -- the army asked him to take over the presidency. And the people asked him to take over the presidency. And he was telling them about the things that he could do, all these great things. He was going to build these roads, build houses, fix the economy in all kinds of ways. And unfortunately, it just didn`t work out that way for him. 

Has anybody come to you and said, you know, in the end, this was a genocidal killer, you know, and why are we making a movie about him and glorifying him? 

I mean, people have definitely spoken to me about the fact that-- But you know, it was interesting. In fact, I -- (inaudible) -- I think I do. She just wrote a book. She won a Pulitzer last year. And gosh, on genocide. Either Sam or Samantha-- 

Samantha Power. 

Yes, exactly. 

She is at Harvard at -- teaches at Harvard for the--. 

Exactly. I met with her. She saw the film. And she wanted to talk to me because she said, this is -- it was, for her, one of the most true depictions of this type of a dictator. She`s met, she said, a number. And it`s like when you meet them, you do -- there`s a charm, there`s a way of making you feel like you`re one of the only people in the room, that you`re invited into this secret place and stuff. So it was really interesting, her response, and I think it`s really important to know that these figures, who we consider so dark, can be this charming or we won`t be able to see them. 

But what`s interesting about that, there is this relationship, a fictional relationship, created to show how he had this great affection for this young British doctor. 

Yes. I mean, Nicholas, James McAvoy`s character, he`s a composite of like three different people. One was a Scottish doctor. And one of them was an expatriate who did become an adviser to Idi Amin. He married an Ugandan wife, (inaudible), he became -- even committed some of the atrocities. He`s a much darker figure than Nicholas, who is still alive today, and then also a Ugandan doctor who had an affair with his wife Kay. As well as-- 

This is all in one character. 

This is all in one character to kind of bring us through-- 

Nicholas. 

Nicholas represents the West and all those people. 

Roll tape. This is when Idi Amin meets Nicholas Garrigan, played by James McAvoy, for the first time. 

Sorry. I couldn`t hear myself think. 

You took my gun? 

Yes. 

Who are you? 

Nicholas Garrigan. I`m doctor Nicholas Garrigan. I work at the medical compound in Gambon. I`m a doctor. 

You are British. 

Well, I`m Scottish. Yes. I`m Scottish. 

Scottish! Why didn`t you say so? I fought with (inaudible). Great soldiers. Very brave and good people. Completely. Let me tell you, if I can be anything instead of a Ugandan, I would be a Scot. 

Really? 

Except for the red hair. Which I`m sure is attractive to your women. But which we Africans, we find quite disgusting. Thank you, Dr. Garrigan. A very good job. 

Now you know why it`s "The Last King of Scotland." He did have this great--. 

Fascination with the Scottish. He liked them. 

Because he fought with them. 

Yes. And they fought alongside him. And he felt that they were more of a common man. They were like -- they treated him more as an equal than the British officers. And then he did make that statement about being the last king of Scotland, because he felt that they were oppressed by the Brits, just like they were, and then he`s like, I`m going to free the Scottish people, I`ll be the last king of Scotland, there will be no others. That was something that he did say. 

Do we know when he turned? I mean, historians clearly know. When he sort of lost it and he went from great aspirations to a despotic character? Was there a moment? Was there an event? Was there anything? 

I think some of the reporting after the expulsion of the Asians paid a heavy toll on him. 

Why did he do that? 

Well, I mean, I think from his point of view, he had offered them citizenship as Ugandan citizens, and they could stay. But they have to give up their British citizenship. None of them really wanted to do that. But I think the Asians controlled 80 to 90 percent of the economy of Uganda. They controlled basically everything. And he was trying to find a balance in his way. He said he had a dream. I mean, he woke up one morning and said I have a dream, I have to expel the Asians from the country. But those were the facts. And it was disappointing, because you know, East Indians were, you know, second, third generation Ugandans. So it was very emotional for them. But it did change the face of the country. I mean, today there are a lot of Ugandan businessmen that there weren`t -- at that time, there weren`t any at all. 

Actually, among African countries, Uganda has shown the most progressive attitude about AIDS. 

It`s true. Originally for a moment-- 

South Africa on the other hand for a long time wouldn`t accept it. And the Ugandans for some reason-- 

Yes, under Museveni, the current president, they`ve really like changed around the AIDS problem. The AIDS problem has like really lowered to what they might consider really manageable. 

One more look at Idi Amin as played by Forest Whitaker. People are raving about his portrayal across the board and talking about Oscar nominations and things like that. But he`s been around enough to know that there`s always talk and then there are nominations. But lots of people look at this performance and say it has all the makings of that, because he`s able to capture the whole arc of this. And here is one of those moments, in which Idi Amin is talking with Nicholas Garrigan about who he is. 

I can`t think. I can`t sleep. Look at this. Look at this. The British newspapers said I am a madman. The American newspapers say I am a cannibal. I am a cannibal, huh? These are lies. I should throw them out for good. All the Ugandan press. 

Do you want something for the headache, sir? 

No. 

Something to help you sleep perhaps? 

Later. I want you to tell me what to do. 

You want me to tell you what to do? 

Yes, you are my adviser. You are the only one I can trust in here. You should have told me not to throw the Asians out in the first place. 

I did. 

But you did not persuade me, Nicholas. You did not persuade me. Tell me what to do here. 

Don`t throw the journalists out. They`re only going to write more lies about you. Invite them to meet you face to face. You charm them. You show them what kind of a man you are. 

This is what you said about playing Idi Amin. "I`ve played real characters before and I`ve done accents before, but the combination of skills necessary for this movie -- learning Swahili and mastering the dialect, figuring out Amin`s history and what it`s like to be an African, learning the accordion -- it was a lot. Actually, the accordion wasn`t so bad. In fact, it taught me how to breathe for the character." Tell me about this process of getting there. First, you have got to understand the man and his passion. Then you have got to figure out how you can communicate that. 

Exactly. You can get -- you get all this information, and then you start working on the accent, the dialect. You know, the way he spoke to you, like I`m looking at it and listening to is trying to get a key. Trying to get a clue into it. And working on the Swahili, to kind of train my mind, to know that`s my language, and then just studying the history not just of Idi but of the past leaders of Uganda and then going meeting all these people, his brothers, sisters, generals, ministers. Soaking in Uganda in an organic way, like it`s some sort of eucharistic thing that you eat and it becomes a part of you is what I needed it to be. So it became an organic thing for me so that his spirit would be able to sort of envelope me, because it was his spirit I was trying to find. Idi Amin is one thing. The spirit and the image and the myth and the way people think of this man is even larger than that. And so I was trying to embody that. And that took some internal work, really, going inside of myself. 

And how did you do that? And what did you find? 

Internally? 

Yes. 

I mean, one, I look for the places where I -- inside of me that could be (inaudible), rooms inside of me that could be bigger. You know, that understood that this confidence in my place. That`s why some of those gestures and some of the things he did helped me. Lowering my voice because I feel stronger. You know what I mean? But then also like looking for the darkness. Not necessarily for some personal experience, but that feeling. And I think sometimes-- 

A sense of rage? 

Yes, that feeling. And making myself so passionate about certain things in one direction that it can set me off in something else. Just that thought of what you`re saying, and letting that build. And that took like a lot of -- sometimes meditative work, by sitting still and like letting that build and build and build. And living with the character pretty much most of the time I was there so that I could make that come out. 

Great to have you here. 

It`s great to be here. 

"The Last King of Scotland." A brilliant performance by Forest Whitaker. Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
