Joe Pytka has been called the King of Commercials by advertising executives and critics alike. The director of acclaimed ad for products like Pepsi, McDonald's and Nike has worked with everyone from Madonna to Shaquille O'Neal. The man who has won countless awards, added 1 more last night with his Grammy for best music video, short form for the Beetles, "Free as a bird." (music playing) Last year he turned his directing talent to the screen with a box office smash, Space Jam starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny and I am pleased to have him here. First of all, congratulations for that. 

Thank you very much. 

The Beetles, what did you come away from this kind of experience thinking about the Beetles? 

I kind of grew up with the Beetles, I was a little older than the normal fans at the time and they were an important part of my culture, just like Miles Davis or someone like that, they were part of it. Not probably as important to my thoughts as other people. I was consumed by them but they were profound. When I heard Sergeant Peppers for first time, I was blown away because we hadn't heard music like that for a long time. I've always been a huge admirer of them and I was appalled when they broke up and we understood all that. Then when this project came up, I was sort of totally surprised, caught me totally off guard. I don't know why -- I never found out why they contacted me or why they chose me to do this because I know everybody in the world knew about this. Me being in my little tunnel like I am, I didn't realize what was happening. They called me out of the blue to get involved and I got involved. 

They being the Beetles? 

Actually I was contacted first by a production executive at ABC, David Schultz, who was involved with the ampalogy project. Who in a very casual way, asked if I would like to be involved with the Beetles video. I said "sure." A month or so later I get another call and then I met with Neil Aspenall, who runs Apple. 

Was this before or after Space Jam? 

Well before. 

Well before? 

Yeah, this was like 3 or 4 months before Space Jam. 

Grew up in Pittsburgh, you? 

Yeah. 

Was is Pittsburgh itself? 

Actually it was small town outside of Pittsburgh called (Braddick) -- 

Part of the greater Pittsburgh area. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

Absolutely. 

Wanted to be a painter. 

I went to school for a long time, there was my -- I had a slight gift as a painter, I went to the same schools Andy Warhol went to. 

Yeah. 

They have a wonderful program in Pittsburgh, sponsored by the the museum, the Carnegie museum that starts when you're in 3rd or 4th grade. You work your way through the system and they weed you out until you get through and they send you to Carnegie, then it was Carnegie Tech, now it's Carnegie Mellon. I went through that entire program and then when it was time to go to college, I got diverted to engineering. 

Your father probably had an influence. 

Yeah, yeah (crosstalk) How are you going to make it as a painter son? I don't know dad. 

Then you fell in love with video. You dropped out and fell in love with video? 

In college, I went to study chemical engineering, which was a total disaster and I had a creative thing going and film was sort of my second -- It was probably my first love but at the time it's my second love and I tried to get into a theater program while I was in college and the people were very standoffish, it was a clickish kind of atmosphere and I was offended by that. I still wanted to get into theater and through a stroke of luck, my best friend at the time got me a job at a small motion picture company developing news film at night. 

Tell me what it is you do. We know you make these extraordinarily successful and highly paid for making these commercials that are seen, certainly in the Super Bowl but other times too. 

Right. 

You have the ability to make commercials that live. 

Well -- 

You tell me then what it is. Why are you singled out as a maker of television commercials? 

I've had a lot of fortunate experiences working with really good, creative people that come up with the ideas. Truth, I can't do anything without a good text and I might be in the business to long. I think that everybody else has moved on and have a -- 

You're still there. 

-- Handful of clients that are fabulous, creative people and their the real heart of the thing. I serve the text, I don't create the ideas, I execute the ideas. 

Okay, what's the challenge each time you go to bat is to what? Tell a story and-- 

Yeah, tell the story the best way. Simple. Tell the story the best way it can be told with the resources at hand. 

That's exactly my challenge right here, in an interesting way its the same thing. 

Everywhere. 

Tell a story in the best way you can. 

In every creative profession and even in the sciences. If you're a musician and you're playing a song, you want to play it in a way that becomes your story. If you're a composer, you want to write the music down, you're telling a story in music. It's anything. If you're a writer, you tell the story in a compelling way. You remember the famous story about Hemingway and at the end of -- "For Whom the Bell Tolls" or something. He wrote the last page 50 times and they published every version. Some of them were atrocious, he analyzed them all and finally published the right one. 

Yeah, I remember Hemingway -- Once somebody once said that Hemingway -- there was nothing that he ever wrote that he didn't rewrite 32 times. 

Absolutely. Now we don't have that chance except in terms of some of the editing and some of the takes during the thing. You kind of do that before you film because a film is an incredibly expensive medium. You don't have the opportunity to play so much during the fact or after the fact. You do all that ahead of the game and you have an instinctive feeling about what will work and what won't work. 

Okay, roll tape. Here are some of those commercials. 

Bo knows baseball. 

Bo knows football. 

Bo knows basketball too. 

Bo knows tennis? 

No. 

Bo knows weights. 

Bo, you don't know didly. 

First one that misses. 

Watches the winner eat lunch. Got it. 

Off the glass. Get in there. 

Nice shot. 

One knee. 

Switch knee. Get in there. 

Off the floor, off the scoreboard, off the bankboard, no rim. 

This is your brain. This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions? 

(singing) 

(inaudible). I never could afford Santino but I didn't know until this day that it was (inaudible) all along. 

Mama says stupid is as stupid does. 

I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore. 

The force is with you, young Skywalker. 

Toga, toga, toga, toga, toga, toga, toga- 

September 19th, their inexplicable behavior continues. 

Yo Adrian, I did it! 

I've got to go now, Braveheart is on. 

Now, our feature presentation. 

I look at that stuff. I mean, I don't want to praise you here, but that's talent, putting that together, telling a story. 

There's a huge amount of talent in the people that wrote this stuff. I don't want to harp on that. 

What is this humble pie you're giving me? 

It's not humble, it's reality. I would never come up with an idea like that thing in (indiscernible). The guys at the agency came up with that. They were brilliant. The wrecking ball commercial, that Nike, the thing that's interesting there is there's a whole body of different kinds of work and all I do is figure out how to tell their stories as well as can be done. I put my input into it but the basic idea is theirs. I'm a director, I'm not a writer, I'm not an art director. All I do is collaborate with these guys and do the thing. I think if I have a skill at that, is choosing the work I want to do. I would love to do everything myself but that's not the way the business works, you see. The wrecking ball commercial, where the posters come to life, that is a brilliant conceptual idea because it's so -- It's kind of self-serving in a positive way. Here, you have Nike ads on buildings coming to life in a Nike commercial on television and it's a pure advertising idea. The guy that conceived this thing, his name is Warren Eakens, had these little sketches. I saw these little sketches, I said, "This is a great idea." He said, "How can we do this?" I said, "Warren." We were in Brazil shooting a World Cup Match and I think he got the idea down there. I said, "Warren, I have the slightest idea. All I know is if you do it, it has to be perfect." At that time, the technology did not exist to do it as well as it was. It took us about a year and a half to complete the commercial. By the time we got to the end part of the process, the technology had caught up with the idea and we were able to do it. Since then, the technology has gotten so good that you could do the commercial for half what it cost. 

Yeah, what'd it cost then? 

That thing cost a million and a half dollars or something. They spent at least, I would say five or six hundred thousand dollars of that just on the digital effects. 

Yeah, before we leave those slough of commercials, competitive guys. You don't get any tougher and more competitive than those two. 

Brutal. 

I mean, they must have cho- 

Brutal. They chewed me up and spit me out in little pieces. When we were shooting that, it was in the middle of a blizzard in Chicago. Now, talk about guns to your head. We had four hours a day to shoot that commercial. Two days, four hours each day. Impossible, absolutely impossible to do. I walked on the set, "We're never going to get this done. The first day, Michael Jordan is two hours late. Now, Michael doesn't give you the two hours late. In other words, if he's two hours late, the four hours still stands so now, I have six hours to do these commercials. In the time we're waiting for Michael to show up, I'm so bored we start to play basketball, just clowning around on the -- 

You've always got a basketball (crosstalk). 

It's get rid of nervous energy and hostility and tension and all that stuff. I'm playing basketball with the stand ins for Michael and Larry and I have a kid that plays with me, my assistant camera manager, really young, athletic kid. Fantastic athlete. We're just playing for maybe an hour, hour and a half. I walk off the court and Larry Byrd says, "Boy, you really love a game of basketball, don't you?" I said, "Yeah, I do." He says, "You know, you are the worst basketball player I've ever seen." Now, I just met this guy. We haven't worked together, we haven't done a thing and he starts on me already. 

Choppy right there. 

We played a little bit and he killed me, didn't give me a bit. Pounded me just as if I were- 

And they share the quality of being so damn competitive. 

These two guys? Unbelievable. I wish that Michael was either a little older or Larry was a little younger so they could play against each other more. The old Magic Johnson and Larry Byrd thing, it would love to have this sort of triangle- 

What was great about those two, about Larry and about Magic is they really loved each other. There was a great sense of -- Magic used to say you go to any black playground in the country and Larry could walk on the court. 

Because Larry was a player. Larry Byrd was a player. There are a lot of guys that pretend to be players but Larry Byrd was a player, had a huge heart, hugely competitive, and he was honest. He would go in your face. You heard the famous story about he and Julius Irving? 

No. 

Oh man, that's a great story. 

Tell me. 

Late in Irving's career, they're going head to head. I'm not sure how accurate this -- Forgive me Julius, forgive me Larry. Larry Byrd is killing him and they were running down the court together and Larry Byrd turns over to Julius saying, "forty two to six," and that's the point spread. Irving almost killed him. I think they almost started a fight or something. That's how competitive he was. Then, there's the thing he said to me when we were shooting. He said, "Here's what I used to love to do." He'd be by the three point line. He said, "When the other guy's bench is here, I'd stand back, I'd just take one step back over the three point line, shoot the ball, and before it hits, turn, say, 'Merry Christmas,' and start down court and the ball would go through." How can you not love the guy? Amazing, amazing. The best thing about guys like Magic and Larry is that they made their teammates better. 

Yeah, but are they actors? Can they act? Is that a problem? 

As long as they play themselves. Can they act? Larry was- 

And how's their attention span? 

Attention span is gone. You have to keep them occupied. The athletes have an attention span of the sport that they're in. Two hours. Two hours, two and a half hours. They get bored, you have to keep them totally occupied, it's only fair to them. You have to make sure that they are secure in you knowing what you're doing. That's the most important thing I could bring, that I am prepared to make them look good. You saw the Bo knows commercial, right? We're doing a show with Kurt Gibson and it was the Spring after he hit the great homerun. 

Right. 

Now, Kurt Gibson, we're down in (inaudible), down in Florida. We set up a batting cage as the background prop. The shot is a shot of his head, doesn't matter where the batting cage is. Well, they set the batting cage up about six feet in front of home plate. He comes over to me, and he looks at me in the eye and he says, "Is that where you want the batting cage?" I couldn't tell him that the shot was going to be this and go through this long explanation. I said, "Where should it be?" He says, "It should be over there." We put it there. I lost face in front of the guy. He thought I was an idiot. 

Doesn't know. 

I'm not going to explain to him where the batting cage should be for the shot. You just have to make yourself look good. 

Space Jam made a lot of money, a hundred thirty, eighty, forty something million dollars. 

It's about two hundred and something worldwide now. It's doing huge in Europe. It's number one all over Europe. 

Why is that? 

I don't know. 

Is it Michael? 

I don't know. It's hard for me to know who likes who or whatever. There's never been a precedent for a movie like Space Jam. It's a miracle that the movie even got made and now it's been successful, which is another miracle. Someone out there is smarter than I am about putting the piece together. It was a very successful commercial, Michael and Bugs on the Superbowl. The second one we did was not as successful. 

How do you measure success? 

Public response, that thing they have in USA Today, the poll, and then Nike sold a lot of stuff and Warner Bros. sold a lot of stuff. In both ways, the public pushed the button the right way and then they sold a lot of stuff. It seems that Michael is a bigger star in the world than we think or Bugs is, but the movie is far more successful than I ever dreamed it would be, especially in Europe. It's been the number one movie in every country that's played in its timeframe. 

You made a move with Richard Dryfus, whose title I forgot. 

Let It Ride. 

Let It Ride. 

About horse racing. 

Yeah, and you liked it. 

I love it. 

Yeah, you think it's a great movie. 

I don't think anything I've ever done is great. 

It's better than it was received? 

Something happens, people like to categorize everything. The movie was dumped by the studio, Paramount. 

Say it out loud. 

I could care less. They screwed this movie up. They made a cult movie and they didn't know it. It's sad. The only reason I did the movie was the script was the weirdest script I've ever read. I had another movie that I'd written somewhere else and my agent, it was not going anywhere. It was sitting around the studio, going around the re-write stage. My agent said, "You got to do a movie soon or nobody's ever going to want to work with you." They sent me a bunch of scripts and I read Let It Ride and I thought it was the quirkiest thing I'd ever read and I couldn't figure out why a major studio was doing this movie. Richard was attached and the only reason I wanted to do the movie was it was a quirky script, and Richard was there. Richard's a brilliant actor. 

Right, brilliant guy. 

Yeah. 

You don't think so. 

No, I didn't say that. Yeah, he's brilliant. Richard's brilliant. He did a great job in the movie. Best work he's ever done. I looked at all of his movies. His performance in that movie is amazing and is courageous but it's not likable in a conventional sense. Now, what's happened to the movie in the ten years or whatever, we did it in '88, is that people have rediscovered it. Siskel and Ebert reviewed it about two years ago. They didn't know about it. Siskel said, "I don't know how the hell I missed this movie, but this is a great movie." He went down every point that I tried to do in the film and hit it on the head. There's a terrific critic in 

Roll tape, this is Space Jam. We'll see this and then we'll close out here. Here it is. 

The Monstars 

Oh, that's got to hurt. 

The Monstars. The Monstars stole the talent from the NBA players. 

So that's what happened to those guys. 

I think we should qui, qui, qui, forfeit. 

Yeah. 

Listen, I didn't get dragged down here just to get my butt whipped by a bunch of ugly Monstars. I ain't going out like that. We're letting them push us around. We got to fight them back. We got to take it to them. We got to get right in their faces. What do you say? Are you with me or not? 

You finished? Great speech and all, doc, you had them riveted. 

So why don't you make more movies? 

Boy, I just don't watch me. 

No, come on. Are you hungry to do that? Do you want to do it? 

I love movies. The business has gotten to the point where it's a lot of blockbusters, a lot of small movies. I had about 4-5 scripts that I worked on on my own for years, and I've not been able to get them done properly, and I get very busy doing what I do. Time goes by quickly. I love what I do and I try to spend as much time with my family when I'm not working. I would have to commit to movies. I can't do what I've been doing now. If I have a chance to do Free as a Bird, where I work with Michael Jordan, or like I told you earlier, George Plimpton, that does great things. I just would have to quit what I'm doing and devote my time to movies to do the films I'd like to do. 

Your client like Nike, like Pepsi-Co, like whoever the big ones are, might walk away to somewhere else if you're not available. 

I've been working with it for a long time, and as a continuity, there's an overlap factor that goes on and then a year goes by. Two years go by. Ten years go by. Hopefully I'll do another movie or two, but if I don't, I'm not going to be brokenhearted because I'd like top put Free as a Bird up against any movie last year. 

Yeah. 

That's inventive, and it drives from a fabulous source and it will make a lot of people happy, as did Space Jam. 

Great to have you here. 

Thank you very much. Been a huge pleasure. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
