If you're having trouble reaching an office in the next few weeks, it might be because the workers are too busy checking their brackets, seeing how their choices are doing as they make their way through three weeks of competition that will decide who wins the NCAA's men's basketball title. March Madness is one of America's biggest sports spectacles, and the money at stake is also very big. CBS and Turner Sports are in the midst of a 20 year $19.6 billion deal for broadcast rights. A single ad in the Finals goes for $1.5 million, and Americans will bet an estimated $9 billion on the games. While the tournament produces memorable moments like this game-winning shot by Villanova's Kris Jenkins at the buzzer last year, there is also a long record of scandals and controversies, players coddled through their academic work, shady recruitment practices, and the bigger question of whether those athletes are exploited by their schools and by the NCAA. Joining me in New York, Bill Rhoden. He's a columnist and editor at large for ESPN's Undefeated, and author of "Forty Million Dollar Slaves." Joe Nocera is a columnist for Bloomberg View and author of "Indentured: The Inside Story of the Rebellion Against the NCAA." And from Orlando, John Feinstein, a sports columnist for the Washington Post and author of, among many books, "The Legends Club." Pleased to have them all. Welcome. I want to start with you, John, explain to the uninitiated what makes the March Madness so compelling? 

Well, Jeff, I think it's two things. It's the one-and-out nature of the event. It's not best of seven teams. It can be the number one seed, the number two seed, whatever. They lose, they have a bad shooting night, somebody's hurt at the wrong time, they're done. But more than that, it's the true underdog aspect of the so-called double digit seeds, those teams seeded ten and higher, who have a real chance to win early round games, and in some cases actually get to the Final Four. George Mason got to the Final Four in 2006. VCU got to the Final Four in 2011, and Butler, which is now in a big-time league, but wasn't at the time, got to the Final Four in 2010 and 2011, to the championship game in both cases. We love to root for underdogs, and the NCAA tournament gives us underdogs like no other event in sports does. 

Yeah, this may be the only arena where the men of Princeton are considered underdogs in life. I take your point. Is it also the nature of the competition that there are individuals that we're going to keep a special eye on? I'm thinking of a certain 17-year-old from UCLA for instance. 

Yes. And the shame of it, though, Jeff, is that Lonzo Ball will not be a sophomore at UCLA. He won't be a junior at UCLA. He's going to be playing in the NBA next year. That's one thing that has changed over the years, because the NBA passed a rule saying you must go to college for one year before you can go in the NBA draft, but after that, you can. It used to be that a great player like LeBron James or Kobe Bryant might skip college altogether and go to the pros, but most guys who didn't do that would stay at least three or four years, and we got to know them. They were almost part of our family. A kid like Grant Hill who stayed at Duke for four years almost became part of people's families. That's why he's so popular even now 23 years after he graduated. It's not the same, but there's no doubt that somebody will emerge as a star at the end of this tournament. Last year it was Kris Jenkins making that shot that you showed us. And by the way, he is a senior at Villanova. 

Bill, let's stay with the tournament itself for a minute or two. Handicap this for us. 

Oh, God, I mean, that's best -- 

Putting you too much on the spot? 

Well, no. Well, no. I mean, it's great. I mean, because nobody knows. I'm on the spot. Who knows? I mean, maybe John knows, you know. But, you know -- 

I'm glad you got that question, Bill. 

Yeah. Yeah, I know. You know, the thing is, and John touched on it, the beauty of this is -- and for me, the most compelling part are these next two weeks, when you've got the quote, unquote, so-called underdogs. Because, John, we all know that after these two weeks it's pretty much going to end up with big money. It's going to be either Duke or North Carolina. I mean in this context if UCLA makes the Final Four it's kind of an upset, because, A, they're in another time zone. So I would not be surprised if the Final Four is Duke/Carolina. I don't know if that could happen. But, you know, Duke, Carolina, Kansas, and I think I would put in UCLA just because it's a really good story. But this whole idea of the underdog, I mean, after these two weeks, to me, it becomes very predictable. 

There's another aspect to this, because you've written not just about the surface of sports but what's underneath it. To some extent, when you watch this tournament, is it a guilty pleasure; that is, do you watch it knowing full well some of the less attractive aspects of this? 

Not me. I mean we all know where all the bodies are buried. And if I'm tearing up, it's not because I'm crying from the exploitation of the athletes, it's the makeup. But, no, you know, we're all big guys now. And I tell kids from the age of 16 that you're either going to be -- or 14 -- that you're either going to be the tool or you're going to be the carpenter. You make that choice. You know, you make the choice. So by this time, when we see the competition, you know, you've got an opportunity to get an education. You make that call. I mean, I think morally exploitation is this idea of making people have to go somewhere, go to UCLA for a year or two, as opposed to let them do what tennis players do, anybody else. If you're good enough to play professionally, go. But this idea of making them kind of have to make them stay for a year, it does turn things into a farce. 

Now I don't think anyone has written more critically about the NCAA as an institution, than you. So, despite that, do you watch this tournament with at least one eye as a fan, or do you watch with the knowledge of what you see as a pretty unpleasant -- 

I definitely watch it as a fan. I can enjoy it. I grew up in Providence. I wrote for the Providence College Friars all my life. I love college basketball my whole life. That hasn't really changed. But I go in knowing that every aspect of this tournament is about maximizing revenue, every aspect. You can't walk into your seat with a product that's not NCAA sponsored. They actually take them away from you as you walk in through the gate to take your seat. Every aspect of this is commercial. They maximize the revenues, except for the labor force, as I like to put it. The labor force does it for free. So, you know, you know that. You know the players are enjoying it, but there is something wrong. There is something wrong. 

To what extent do you think the way that the fans get immersed in these two weeks, particularly the bracketology, the betting of an estimated $9 billion, to what extent do you think that that, in a way, shields this event and the institution like the NCAA from a more public accounting of what they've done? 

You don't need bracketology to shield the NCAA. The average college sports fan, whether it's football or basketball, does not care. If you go to an Alabama football game and you start to ask people about the exploitation of athletes, they'll laugh at you. If you go to an NCAA Final Four game, they'll laugh at you. There's a segment of the society that has come to view this as a problem. I'm among those people that something wrong is happening here and the way they're treated, both in terms of financial exploitation and academic exploitation, but most people don't care. 

John, do you care, John Feinstein? Should we care? 

Oh, I care, and I watch the games. I enjoy these first and second-round games that Bill is referencing more than any, because it does involve the smaller schools where there are not the big bucks. But it's not the bracketology that shields what's going on, Jeff, it's television. Television presents the best of the NCAA Tournament. We see the fantastic finishes. They do all these trickily stories on these wonderful, quote, student athletes, as the NCAA always calls them, as television always calls them. They do these interviews with coaches and players in which, you know, they're all going to save the world when they get out of the college. There's a PSA that runs every year during the tournament, which says there are 470,000 student athletes in the NCAA who will never play in the NBA or the NFL, and you've got a kid who's a swimmer and plays the violin and has a 4.0 GPA, as if he's the typical student. So I think that's where they sell it. They sell the tournament and the people playing in the tournament very well. But you can still acknowledge that the games are great, that the players are terrific at what they do, and enjoy the competition, while knowing, as Bill said a minute ago, that there's something behind that door that they don't want you to see. 

Yeah. And, again, we've all been doing this for decades. I mean, I've been doing it almost 40 years. It's not that I've become jaded, but we all have our passions about what's wrong. My passion, I'm less -- you know, and Joe and I have kind of been on the other side of this. I'm less concerned about the exploitation of athletes. Now I look at the media. I look at the media. And what you're going to see tonight, you're going to see a media that's almost 90 percent white. You know, so if you look at anything around it, event production, everything around it is white. The only role that black folks play are going to be these ten kids on the court maybe. But if you look at our industry, the media, which continues to be overwhelmingly white, to me, that's more of a passion I've got. How do we correct that? You could argue that the NCAA is trying, at least, to do things with GPAs or make sure we get rid of the $20 million coaches. But our industry -- and that's all I can deal with -- our industry remains this sort of exclusionary industry that will deal with these black guys on the floor, but in terms of the coaches, there are fewer black coaches. You know, that is my passion. That, to me, when Joan says "something's wrong," now that's something wrong. That's our industry. That's something that we should be having as much passion with eradicating as stuff at about whether a kid, you know, gets a billion dollars after staying for one year. 

There are 65 schools in the Power Five conferences. Nine of them have African American coaches. 70 percent of the players are African American, and with all that hand wringing about graduation rates, which there's reason to wring your hands, I'm here at a golf tournament right now. The golfers don't graduate at any better rate than basketball players do. Very few of them that play on the tour right now are college graduates, but nobody worries about it. Why? Because they're not African American, and everybody's concerned that an African American without a college degree can't survive in society today, but a white kid who is no smarter, no better educated, they think is going to be okay. I think Bill's right on it. 

Let Joe come on it. 

I just think, Bill, if you've got ten black kids on the field making all these white people rich, which they're doing, and not being compensated for it, to me there's something wrong with that. 

Joe, the compensation -- I hear what you're saying. But the compensation should be the degree. 

Why do you get to decide that? 

Pardon? 

Why do you get to decide that? 

I think anybody in civilized America thinks that the compensation should be your education. In our community, education has always been the key. It's always been the key. And I think to all of a sudden to make this about money, that, well, you know, we're getting paid. No, the payment should be your degree. The payment should be education. And I like the idea -- 

So if Katie Ledecky gets $200,000 from the Olympics and she's allowed to swim, as she is, in college, why is that okay? Why is there nothing wrong with that, which the NCAA allows, but for a black kid to get $15 from a booster, he has to be suspended? 

And not just a black kids, anybody. I mean, what we're talking about, we're talking about two things. We're talking about how each sport kind of picks and chooses who it allows to make money. The fact is that -- and what you're talking about is a plantation system. Basketball, football, at the highest level, supports everything. They are the two money making revenue sports. 

Just to be clear, the point here is that those big money sports, you're saying, support, for instance, women's athletes at the colleges. 

They support everything. And I think -- and I mean, I'm kind of arguing your point. If these top 25 schools and these kids are doing the heavy lifting, you know, the football and basketball players are doing the heavy lifting so the field hockey people, the swimmers can play, why shouldn't they be compensated? And at an ideal level, I say sure, I think that in football, yeah, I agree that if you go to a bowl game and there's a $2 million pay off, I absolutely agree that there should be some revenue sharing. Maybe you get ten percent that's put into an escrow, that's put into escrow that when you graduate you have access to it. No problem with that. 

The point, as somebody who you might expect did not play college athletics, it does occur to me, John, that if I had written a book and it was a big success, and I wrote it while I was in college, I'd have made a lot of money from that. 

Right. 

And I think the question that Joe keeps raising is very valid, is, why is this the one group that is not permitted to profit when they are helping other parts of the university make a ton of money? 

Well, and that's a very good and important point to make. And I've always said when I was a sophomore in college, if the Washington Post had come to me and said, "We think you are the next great sports writer, and we're going to pay you $100,000 a year right now," which, back then, was like a million dollars now, I never would have been a junior. I would have said this is what I'm training to do. I think I'm good at it. Somebody else is willing to pay me to do it, why do I need my college degree? Carl Bernstein never graduated from college. He did okay. But the point about paying the athletes, there are all sorts of issues. Joe knows this better than I do. He's more expert in this areas than I am. There are issues with tax and scholarships and things like that. But Bill's idea is headed in the right direction, create a trust fund for the athletes in football and men's basketball and say, when you graduate -- you know, Lonzo Ball isn't going to need that money, but most of the players on the UCLA team could use $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 and have an incentive to graduate to get that money, and maybe more athletes would graduate then, and that would be good for everybody. And the other thing about it is, people are going to say, well, people are going to say Title 9. You can't do it because you have to compensate the women's athletes. No, you don't. The women's athletes at Connecticut, yes, because they make the school money. You write the bill or whatever it might be to say, "any revenue sport," a sport that makes money for the school, whether it's men's or women's or soccer, or whatever it might be, and that way Title 9 isn't an issue. 

Let me turn to Joe. Do you think that there is movement toward the paying of athletes? Are we seeing -- 

No. It will never happen. The only way it would happen is if the athletes themselves went on strike, and that's not going to happen. There's a lot of people who thought five years ago that the legal system was going to fix this, and it's very, very clear that that will not happen; that the legal system has basically said in the Court of Appeals in California that the NCAA rules of amateurism violate America's antitrust laws, but the courts are unwilling to take the next logical step and say, "Therefore, you got to get rid of the rules." Instead, the courts have basically said you can fiddle around with the rules but you can keep them. But the fact is, there's no incentive on anything's part in the system to pay the player except the players. 

Different point, if I may, because you raised the issue of television. You work for ESPN, which is in the odd position sometimes of celebrating the athletes. The promos alone are something out of a massive Hollywood concept, and also covering the darker side. So my question is -- and luckily for you, ESPN is not broadcasting the NCAA -- do you any North Carolina takes the floor we're going to hear about some of the allegations about academic bending of rules that have shadowed North Carolina? 

Yeah, I think you will, and you have to. I mean, ESPN -- and, again, I worked for the Times for 35 years, and that was a different kind of animal. But, yeah, I mean, ESPN has actually butted heads with Roger Goodell because of how one side of ESPN has really covered the NFL and the concussion issues. I think that, yeah, I think you're going to have to talk about NCAA and North Carolina and the sort of, you know, darker issues off the academic floor. You have to. Let me just say one thing; that, you know, I played football at HPCU. I played at Morgan State University. I played for four years. And, you know, this was HP -- I mean, was I exploited? Yeah, sure. I had a mentor who replayed Grambling every year at Yankee Stadium, and he stopped going because he said, you know, you guys are kind of -- there's a thing here, you kind of get exploited. I was 19. I was having a ball and I was an English major, got a degree. There were guys who got medical -- you know, who are doctors now, lawyers. I guess what I'm saying to Joe is that, yeah, I mean, there are things that are definitely wrong with the system. But this is one of the most unique systems in the world, where you can actually go to a university and be a runner or swimmer and get a degree and get a college degree. I think there's nothing wrong with that. I think that's the good thing. Now do we need to tweak things? Yes. But in terms of eliminating or getting rid of, you're going to hurt more people. You are going to hurt more people, you know, African -- you're going to hurt more people by just eliminating this than you're going to help. 

Well are you talking about eliminating this? You're not talking about cancelling the NCAA tournament, are you? Or are you? 

No. No. No. Absolutely not. I mean, my -- look, my thing is pretty simple. When you have an exploited labor force that's not getting its economic value and making everybody else rich, you should change that system. That's what it really comes down to. I don't think a scholarship is nearly enough, especially, as you just brought up, North Carolina, since so much of the academics is substandard. And it's worth pointing out, by the way, that North Carolina was in the Final Four last year. And, you know, the scandal came up. I won't say it was glossed over, but at a certain point, there wasn't much to say. And that's true this year, because it still hasn't been settled. 

John, this is sort of an interesting thing to me. 

Yeah. And by the way, Roy Williams, a North Carolina coach, has said he hopes it's settled before the end of his life, because the NCAA is so good at dragging its feet. But to your point, Joe -- it's true. But to your point about it will take the athletes doing something, there was a basketball player at Duke in the 1970s named Dick DeVenzio who actually tried to organize a boycott of the Final Four almost 20 years ago. The person he went to help with it, by the way, was Dean Smith, the coach at North Carolina. And Dean Smith was not against the idea because he felt that his athletes and others were exploited. Tragically, Dick DeVenzio died of cancer, and nobody has revived the idea since. I think some day that idea will be revived by somebody. 

Hey, John, remember, what, two years ago the Grambling State University football players refused to go to Jackson State and play a football game. It had nothing to do with payment. It had to do with we have substandard things. We're not going to play. And guess what, they shut it down. There was no homecoming. 

That sounds like Joe's point is the point. If the athletes don't do something, if the athletes don't organize themselves, nothing's going to change. But let me thank Joe Nocera. Let thank you, John Feinstein. Let me thank you, Bill Rhoden. Pleasure to have you here.
