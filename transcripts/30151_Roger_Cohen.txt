We begin by talking about the results of the French elections and what it means for France. Welcome to this program. It's a pleasure to be in this wonderful city. The elections-- what are the consequences of these elections, the surprise victory of the Socialists? 

Well, it is a tremendous surprise, Charlie. The president, Jacques Chirac, who's a Conservative, a Gaullist, he was confident enough of victory to dissolve the National Assembly ahead of time, 10 months ahead of time. He didn't have to do it, but he went ahead because he thought he could secure a majority in parliament for the remaining five years of his seven-year term. He shot himself in the foot in a way no French president has ever done before under the 5th Republic, which has been here since 1958. The result, I think, is you're going to see a presidency that's much diminished. This almost monarchical air of the presidency in France-- this was always the most monarchical of republics-- that has been reduced. The president and the new Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, they will be on a virtually equal footing, which is something new in France. Chirac has been discredited. On the economic front, who knows what's going to happen. France, unlike many other countries, has been feeling threatened by globalization, by market reform, by this wave of kind of American energy and dominance that's been sweeping the world. The French want to try to represent something else. They don't want to just bow to the United States and accept what they call a ''unilateral world.'' They want a multi-lateral world. 

But what is it about the French-American relationship that forces the French to assume that globalization is some American idea alone, when the entire world, in terms of the industrial world, is looking at this as the wave of the future and you better jump on or else you're not going to be able to enter the next century-- 

Well-- 

--as a full participant? 

The rivalry, as you know, Charlie, goes back a long way. Both countries have, let's say, universalist pretensions. The French have a sense-- the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the revolution-- they believe that their model should be exported. The American incarnation of liberty and freedom is also a universal model. So the roots go back a long way-- DeGaulle, as you know, after the war, wagging his big finger at the United States, kicking NATO out of France in the 1960s-- there are deep roots to this. But I think the French have always dreamed ''liberty, fraternity, equality.'' You know, equality is there. There's this sense that solidarity-- that some other model is still possible, even in this American-dominated world. That's still there. The arrival of Hollywood, the fact that French kids are now wearing their baseball caps backwards, Nike sneakers-- all this is-- in a way that's almost unique in France, has made them feel that their identity is threatened. They're thrashing around, looking for some other model. 

So globalization, the American culture and the notion of Europe is all an assault on how the French think of themselves and the uniqueness of their culture. 

To the French it's an assault, yeah. They feel that their identity is being undermined. They haven't, like the British, fully accepted the loss of empire. They haven't, like the Germans, had unification. They see the country-- the Internet arriving. They're about to give up their currency, the franc, for the project of a European currency, the euro, in 1999, if that goes ahead. The French in Africa feel they're losing their influence. Kabila, to the French, is simply a pawn of the Americans. Mobutu is, to some extent, France's man. They look around the globe and they see French influence falling away. The British have come to terms with the loss of influence in the world, I'd say. The Germans feel strong in Europe. The Italians have never cared much about their identity. They're longing to become a region of Europe. The French still have a very strong sense of sovereignty, a very strong sense of the state, eight centuries of monarchy and then two centuries of Jacobinism, and they're not ready to give it up. The thing is that the pressures on the new Socialist prime minister, Jospin, are going to be enormous. He's promised new jobs, no more taxes, reducing the working week to 35 hours from 39 with no loss of pay. To many people, this looks like pie in the sky. Now, they're going to try and set out and prove that some other economic model, even in this day of globalization, is possible. 

So budget cutting is not the route that the Socialists are prepared to take and it seems that that is also the message from the French electorate. 

That is the message from the French electorate. They want something else. They're not-- Juppâ, the previous prime minister, was very much Chirac's man, brilliant guy, also quite passionate, but very much a technocrat. And he didn't-- You know, in the 1930s here, there was a slogan, ''du pain et des roses,'' (sp? ) ''bread and roses.'' That's to say you can work and get your bread, but you also have roses. You know, there's something else to life. And this is deep in the French mentality. They are dreaming -- and I think it's a dream because the pressure of the euro, creating the euro, is such that budget deficits have to be kept very tight. So whether they can actually create jobs, spend their way to creating jobs, is doubtful. 

The Socialists-- the new prime minister is committed to the notion of the euro currency, although he may want to change the requirements for getting in. 

That's right. 

Does that mean that those governments in Italy, the Kohl and others are going to look now with more skepticism about Europe because of the results in this election? 

Well, Charlie, the basic question about the euro is Germany. The Germans haven't really had an army since the war. The only thing they've had is a very strong economy and the Deutschmark, which is by far the strongest currency in Europe. You're asking the Germans to give up the mark, symbol of the German economic resurgence since the war, for something called the euro. What the Germans worry about is that if the Italians are in, if the French under the Socialists are in, then the kind of monetary discipline that's been behind the strength of the mark is going to be eroded, and so this new euro may even come to resemble the Italian lira. Now, the Germans, of course, would never accept that, so Jospin has a narrow path to tread. He wants the euro not to represent just monetarist discipline. He wants it to represent jobs and expansion. But how can he do that without letting the Germans believe that, in fact, he's eroding the strength of this planned new currency? 

When you look-- you wrote a piece in the Times that was on the front page in February of 1997. 

I've lived to regret it, Charlie. 

Why have you lived to regret the piece? 

Because there was an explosion here afterwards in which it was claimed that American bombs were being unleashed on Paris, that this-- 

Oh, you were a tool of the imperialists in Washington? 

Yeah, the White House had called me and, you know, instructed me to write this piece and-- no, it was a very, very defensive reaction. Actually, the reaction was almost as interesting as the research on the piece because-- 

All right. Well, tell me about the thesis of the piece first-- 

All right. 

--because it suggested that, at that point, France was at a crossroads. This was before this election took place in June. 

Right. Well, it was a little bit about what we've been talking about, this sense you can have a little bit in Paris, even, of this beautiful city, but a tiny bit a museum, that it's kind of hunkered down, looking at all these developments -- the Internet, the euro, American domination and so on -- and feeling threatened by them, a kind of retreat into a shell and-- 

Less P.C. usage in France than in most of Europe, less connection to the Internet in France than in most of Europe. 

Absolutely. Absolutely. Now, all this was regarded by-- not everybody. Some people said the piece was right on and was fine, but a lot of-- I mean, I was called by several French ministries and their basic message was that this piece was unfairly hostile to France. Now, I think that Chirac and Juppâ, the ex-prime minister, to some extent misread the mood of the country. They thought that the French grudgingly were accepting these changes that they were trying to push through and which I think are necessary-- market reform and so on. 

Deficit reduction. 

Right. You know, Credit Lyonnaise, a state-owned bank, threw away $40 billion. It was just lost, nobody knows how. It's a scandal that hasn't really been looked into. These state-owned companies have thrown away a lot of money. But the French, nonetheless, felt threatened and that's why they threw out the Juppâ government-- (crosstalk) 

Stay to your piece. I don't want to let you go off on this piece. 

Okay. 

You said there's more energy in Berlin, there's more energy in Amsterdam, there's more energy in other capitals than in Paris. 

Well, I think that's the case. I think-- 

More of a sense of the future and excitement. 

See, there's a basic problem here, Charlie. There's this huge unemployment. It's nearly 13 percent. But there is a vast array of benefits and assistance for people on unemployment or people with other kinds of problems. The welfare state here is at a very advanced stage. Now, all these benefits, they have to be paid for. How are they paid for? They're paid for because people who hire people and people who pay people, they pay also a lot of charges which go-- taxes of various kinds which go to supporting these programs. Now, you can't expect, I think, a real change in the unemployment situation without lessening these charges which support the whole welfare state. Now, the French don't see that equation. They think you can preserve all the benefits, all the cushions, and at the same time get the energy that creates jobs. I argued in this piece that France had come to kind of an impasse and that something had to give. 

A crossroads. 

Yeah, a crossroads-- that something had to give, that if France wasn't going to be left behind, become a kind of museum-- somebody I was talking to the other day compared France to one of those families that made a lot of money, let's say 50 years ago, still living very comfortably, still doing fine. You look around you and you wouldn't say, God knows, this is a place in crisis. But little by little-- 

On the surface, they all look great. 

Right. The money in the accounts-- 

The food's good, the wine's good and-- 

--are going down and, you know, the-- there's a limit to how long generations can live on the work of the past generations. 

To your credit, you also pointed out in that piece that France is a great country. France has nuclear weapons. France is on the Security Council of the United Nations, that there is-- this is the fourth largest industrialized economy in the world. 

Yeah. Yeah. 

So there is something here that's special and unique and the potential-- but if it doesn't change-- 

I would argue, I mean, France is a very powerful country. You know, France is not Italy. It's not Spain. It's still very much a country that counts in the world. There is a cultural question here, though, Charlie. I mean, the French are saying, and they're not the only voices in the world, that the American domination of the world has gone too far, you know, that the spread of American popular culture, the spread of American diplomatic, political and economic domination is now such that other countries, whatever the price-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, even if it's self-defeating almost, as it seems to me to be in France, they want to incarnate, represent, something different. And that's the-- that-- the down (? ) is one of the issues here. 

They want to represent something different to the trend towards globalization? 

And to market reform, Thatcherite changes. The Socialists here haven't gone through anything like what the Tony Blair new Labor has gone through in Britain. I mean-- 

In terms of an agonizing reappraisal of what's right for the country. 

Absolutely. And Blair now talks about a ''workless society,'' and that being the number one issue-- you know, that the issue is not supporting people, it's getting people back to work and you can't have benefits without responsibility. 

And Jospin says he is going to, in fact, push through a reduction in the work week. 

Yeah, and preserve all the cushions-- 

And create 350,000 to 700,000 new jobs. 

Three hundred and fifty thousand in the state sector and another three hundred and fifty thousand in the private sector. But the notion-- France Telecom, the phone company here, was going to be privatized, the way British Telecom has been privatized. The Italians have privatized their phone company. The Germans have privatized their phone company. Europe creates those pressures because there is competition now at a European level, like in the United States. These, in a sense, are now states of Europe. Not completely, but you can loosely compare them to states in the United States. 

All right. Before we go, I want to come back to this American-French thing. 

Right. 

So you have Chirac saying, as he went into this election, and as an agenda for the future, ''We have to change because it's the only way to resist an American hegemony,'' right? 

Yeah. 

And then on this other hand, you have the French saying-- the Socialists saying and the electorate saying, ''Wait a minute.'' You know, ''We have to maintain who we are and our uniqueness in order not to be like the Americans.'' So they both are looking, on the one hand, the two opposing ideas in this election-- 

Yes. 

--to ''What do we do''-- 

There were two approaches-- 

--''to stand apart from the Americans?' ' 

Yeah. Right. Well, Chirac was saying, ''We've got-- we want to stand apart from the Americans, but the only way we can do it is through Europe, a stronger Europe which is big enough to''-- 

Large and competitive. 

Yeah, large, competitive and a counterweight. And for that he wanted to push through some of these market reforms and other things, so that Europe, as a whole, and France, as one of the strongest countries in it, would be a counterweight to America. The electorate said no, they don't want that model, they still want France Telecom as a state company, they still want Air France as a state company, and they want to be a social democracy. They want libertâ, fraternitâ, egalitâ-- fraternity and equality. They want that still to represent something in France, so that France goes its own way. We'll see if it's hurtling into a wall. 

Could portend for changes in the rest of Europe? 

I don't think so. I think the rest-- 

Nobody's going to look at the results of this election and say, ''Well, we'd better watch out. Voters don't want to go too far down the line of the market economy''? 

I think the French is a particular case. 

Okay. 

I really do. I think the mood here is particularly anxious and somewhat inward-looking. The British have gone through a radical cultural change with-- Kohl and German unification-- different scene, again. The Italians, they like Europe. It's not a problem for them. 

All right. One last quick question about NATO. 

Yeah. 

Defense still is within the province of the president and not the parliament. 

Correct. 

What happens to re-entering NATO in the same-- 

Nothing happens. They're not going to do it, I don't think. They said they were going to return to the military wing of NATO, but as you know, this was one of the great symbols of Gaullist defiance of the United States, not being in the military wing, coming out and sending NATO packing from France to Brussels. I think this program will now not happen. Jospin, the new prime minister, has made pretty clear that he's not ready for that to happen and Chirac doesn't now have the authority to do anything, for the moment, without Jospin's consent. 

Are you finally saying that Chirac is a weakened president-- clearly, he is, but he is a damaged president for the rest of his term, which goes through the year 2002? 

He is a damaged president, at least for the next several months. How the power play will work out between them, I think you can't say beyond that. But he's really a damaged president. He got himself involved in something he didn't have to do and it blew up in his face. No French president-- Mitterrand in 14 years-- I mean, you can say all kinds of things about Mitterrand, but he was a devilish political maneuverer. He never did anything that humiliated him in that way. So this is a new situation. The presidency is reduced and will be for some time. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thank you, Charlie.
