Harrison Ford has starred in seven of the twenty five highest grossing films in Hollywood's history. A late bloomer. He was thirty five when he made his Hollywood breakthrough in Star Wars, The George Lucas Trilogy, and Steven Spielberg's, Indiana Jones, Chronicles. They have made him one of the great leading men hero's of modern film. That's really funny. After twenty years he has not lost any of that luster. The re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy is breaking box office records and he is currently starring after Brad Pitt and the Devil's Own and by god we are really happy to have him back here. I'm sure he's happy to be here. Isn't it nice. 

It's good to see you. 

Ok listen, I want to talk first about the White House. Did you stay in the Lincoln room? 

Not a penny. 

You gave no money. 

Not a penny. No money. 

Did you stay overnight? 

No. 

No. 

No. 

But you're a friend of the president? You've entertained him at your house, have you? 

I was delighted to have met the president on a number of occasions. I can't say I'm a friend of his. I have respect and admiration for the man and his wife and for what they're trying to do. I've never supported-- 

Let's get that hand up. 

Any politician-- 

You can put your hand right there when you say that. 

For national office. I think these adventures are well enough funded and I prefer when I'm going to use some of my discretionary income to fund other things that are less well supported. 

What's the best thing about being where you are today? 

Freedom. Freedom to be able to do the things I want to do in my work. Like, to be able to take time off with my family when I can do that. Just freedom from the ordinary constraints that everybody faces to a certain extent. Having said that. You're never free of the same restraints that everybody else is-- 

In term of worrying about your kids. In terms of all those kinds of things. 

Nothing changes, just the same problems and more money. 

No matter how much power, no matter how many resources you have. 

I think so. 

You continue to work hard though. This film, which was a long time making, coming out. Air Force One's already been shot. You're off to do something else this summer. 

Yeah. 

You do it because it's just what you do and that's what you want to do or other reasons? 

Yeah. I do it because it's what I want to do. It's what I know how to do. It's where I feel most engaged, most challenged, most useful. It's what I do. 

Would you change anything about it? 

I'm trying to do it less. The reason I've done two in a row here is because Devils Own didn't start when it was supposed to and it got pushed to close to the other one. So it seems as I've gone from one to another but normally I have three or four months in between which is a very luxurious amount of time off for most people. There's nothing that I do that intellectually stimulates me, scares me, engages me, as much as making movies. 

It stimulates you because of what? 

Because it's scary. You have to come up with the answers. You have to perform. You have to do the job you were hired for. You got to make sure it works. You work with a group of people who you've not worked with before usually on rather complex intellectual problems and how to make it work is the main problem. 

Here's what's interesting to me about that. Is that for you to do or the director to do or some kind of collaboration? 

Well I think everybody's has some degree of responsibility and it depends on the directors way of working. Whether they work collaboratively or less collaboratively. If they work less collaboratively then those are the things you want to get nailed down before you start. But most directors allow a very comfortable degree of collaboration in my experience. 

Are you a different actor then you were five years ago? 

Maybe not, maybe not. I hope I've developed more craft skills cause that's the whole object of it for me. I hope that I've become a little bit more appropriate in terms of how I think about things. I'm not sure I'm any better actor. 

It also dependent on, I assume, the kind of script you have to work with and who the collaborators are. All of that can enhance your craft. 

It's also what you get-- It's finally those choices that you make determine who you are and how you acquit yourself. If you challenge yourself, sometime you're going to fall short. If you just do the easy thing then you're gonna be known for doing the easy thing. I mean it's, I don't know what to do except to keep doing it and trying to do it better. 

Do you have any sense of what it is you bring to the screen, other than craft, other than knowing? 

I think in terms of story, I think that if I have a virtue, it's that what I make for myself as a character supports the story. I don't know how to make a character except out of those things that are gonna help tell the story. That to a lot of people sounds back asswards but it's still the only way I know how to work. 

Devils One. 

Devils Own. 

Devils Own. 

Devils One, that's a hell of a title. 

You should of done that. That would of been good. That's the problem. They didn't come to me. That would of been a good title. Devils One. 

Devils One. 

That would of been very good. 

Devils One, good guys zero. 

Good guys, zero. That's right. That would admit that the battle is on and the war's still to be one. Tell me about this film. 

What about it? 

I've seen it. All right. 

So have I. 

You've seen it too. 

Yeah. 

Are you pleased with it? 

I am. I think it goes a long ways towards what we had in mind. 

What did you have in mind? 

We had in mind the story of two guys, two men true unto themselves who come from very different circumstances, who are faded to come in to conflict. The audience will see that coming before it happens, before the characters themselves do. It's a kind of tragedy but it's also a kind of love story in a way before that. These are two guys who admire each other for the right reasons. 

The right reasons are human qualities they have? 

Yeah. 

And the capacity to run the table? 

Yeah. I suppose that's part of it. What happens is that I play a character as a New York City uniform police sergeant. Brad Pitt is a young man who grew up in Ireland, who has joined 

Saw his dad killed in front of him. 

Saw his father killed in front of him by a protestant extremist and who grew up in a cauldron of those troubles, who comes to America on a mission, lives in the basement of the New York City police sergeant. I know nothing of his mission. 

Recommended to you by a friend. 

Recommended by a long time friend, a New York City police or a New York City judge, municipal judge. So I have no reason to suspect that this guys up to no good. We become friends. He's the one person in my house, a family full of girls and here's this younger man who I'm anxious to be a friend to and he see's me in a way as a kind of father figure, early on. Then we come in to conflict because what he's doing does not sit well with the character that I play. 

There's also this storyline. You on the force riding in the police car with Ruben Blades character. 

Yeah. 

What's that storyline? The idea of watching these two characters develop, the relationship between two policemen and the hard choices that you face? You're a guy who's never-- shot his gun three times. 

Yeah. What I want to make sure is that we didn't so morally wake the character, that we didn't show the character that I play, the police officer, as a guy in a white hat. I wanted to have a moral problem for my character as well as what was obviously a moral problem in the character that Brad Pitt plays. So we created this situation in which my partner shoots an unarmed suspect. Somebody who was stealing something out of a car. Somebody who came across a gun, who did fire a gun at us. None the less he didn't have the gun in his hand when my partner shot him. 

Because you had picked up the gun that 

He picked up on the gun that he thrown, and the character, my partner is played by Ruben Blades. In the heat of the moment, fires a fatal shot at this guy, kills him. 

What is it about you, the character in this film, which we renamed the "The Devils One." What is it about this character that because of that moral crisis makes him want to retire from the force? He can't live with himself, what? 

I think- 

The fact he has to cover for his- 

Well, he has to either cover for his partner or not cover for his partner, and both of them are unpalatable choices to him. This is the first time it's happened to him in our story, in our telling of this guy's story. It's the first time he's had to face this kind of conflict. He's unable to. Unable to go -- Unable to support his partner because he did the wrong thing and unable to deal with the consequences of -- I don't know, the word is wrong, but informing on his partner. 

Yeah. Roll tape. Here is when Tom O'Meara, played by Harrison, comes to tell his wife that he's going to retire from the force because of this terrible dilemma facing him. Here it is. 

Well, you covered for him. 

I lied about how it went down. I've thought it through, Sheila. I'll take my pension, retire. 

It's 23 years and you never took a bribe. You never abused your power. You never treated anyone unfairly. 

I treated the dead guy unfair. 

He shot at you. 

He was stealing radios. He got shot in the back. You don't deserve to get killed for stealing a radio. 

Tom, it's terrible that he died, but you're not the only cop of the force who's made a mistake. In fact, you didn't make the mistake; Eddie did. 

I lied. 

The interesting thing about this movie is that you have both that character development, that kind of dialogue interspersed with the dramatic sort of action/adventure kind of thing you have. 

Yeah. 

Is it tough to do that together, or not, or is it simply-- 

It's critical. I mean, I don't care anything about the physical thing unless there's some moral context to it. I don't care about vigorous physical action unless there's something to be lost, something to be gained. I don't want to see violence on the screen without understanding the human cost of violence. 

In questions about Jack Ryan, it's a question of good versus evil? 

Well, it's a question of what's good and what's evil, who's good, who's evil? Who the hell knows? Who has a right to say? 

In a world of geopolitics, who the hell knows? 

In a world of extreme circumstances, in a world where an Irish kid can grow up in the way that the way that the character played by Brad Pitt grows up, in a world where a person like the person that Ruben Blades' character shoots in the back for stealing a radio lives. It's a tough old world out there. Easy answers don't do a service to any of us. 

Here is the other parallel development. This is where you discover the money that Brad Pitt, his character is Rory Devaney, has hid in the house, in the basement where he has been staying. Roll tape. 

Who are you? Did you bring this into my house? 

Aye. 

Where'd you go when you left here? 

I went to make sure it wouldn't happen again. 

It was all lies, wasn't it? Everything you told us. 

Except for how I feel about you and your family. It wasn't a lie. 

That's boy. No, yeah, I really feel for the character that Brad Pitt plays. I think he gave it an incredible -- He made a real emotional investment in the character, and it showed. 

Let me just come to one issue that some people are talking about. 

Sure. 

Can you tell me, or do you speak to this notion that this movie took a long time because they couldn't get the script right because they had too many masters to satisfy, and therefore it was delayed and delayed and delayed because you wanted a certain kind of script, and Brad wanted a certain kind of script, and the director wanted a certain kind of script, and the producer wanted a certain kind of script, and all of a sudden, in that process, which is endemic to Hollywood, you go over budget, and you spend much longer making a film than you want to. 

That ain't exactly how it happened. I came into the project after Brad Pitt had been involved for some period of time. I read a script that had a character that was something I was ambitious for. I wanted to work with Brad. I've admired his work in the past. I respect his ambition to make this film. We were on the picture before Alan Pakula came on the picture. Brad and I agreed on Alan as the director. We had a slot, Brad and I both had a time constraint on us, and we were supposed to have started the film -- I can't remember the exact chronology. It took longer to produce a script. Alan went off to write his version. The director went to write his version of the script. It didn't satisfy everyone. That became the basis for our rewrite, since we went along. Now, here we are well down the line. We have to start shooting without a full script. I've done this before, and as long as there's a general agreement and a general outline, it usually works. It's tougher than if you have a solid script to start from. There was never a contest between Brad and I over who would have a bigger part, who would have a more sympathetic character. We were both concentrating on exactly the same ambition, which is to make the best, most truthful movie that we could. There were, from time to time, differences of opinion about how to achieve that, but they never degenerated into any kind of animosity, personal animosity. The film took longer to do than we had hoped, and therefore cost more money, but I'm satisfied with the result. I think it was a hard-won result, but I'm pleased that we took the challenge. 

Better to make the film you want to make than to get halfway there? 

You know, there's no option but to make the best movie you can. It's a tough old, competitive world, and there's no sense going out there with something that's not as good as you can make it. Of course, there will always be opinions about what is better than something else. Those opinions have to be aired. People have to come to an agreement on those things. 

Have you made films in the last 10 years in which you think that the business has suffered because of whatever reason, not because of box office, but because you think the product wasn't there the way you wanted it to be there? 

Having said what I said, I don't go back and judge it after it's over. I can't do that. It's unfair to other people, and it's unfair to the reality of the circumstances under which a film is made, which are very complex. I would say, yeah, some films that I have made I didn't think were as good as they might have been. I continue to hold the ambition to do the best I can every time I go out. 

What interesting about you too, though, say, unlike others who have had a long and good career, like Clint Eastwood, you have no interest, none, in being a director and sort of being in charge. What you seem to do is something else, which is about craft and being the best possible actor you can. 

And I love working with a team. I don't find another place in my life where I get to work with people the way I get to work with people in a teamwork way on a movie. That's my connection to people. In many ways, I'm kicked out of normal -- kicked up, or whatever, normal human contact. This, in the work that I do, I'm able to find that place working with other people. 

Great satisfaction. 

Sometimes. It's hard work, and I like that about it. If you take it seriously, it's hard work. 

It's hard to be real, to create a character, to carry a story, to make something compelling to a bunch of people sitting in a theater and take them away on a journey. Am I close? 

Yeah, you're close, but that's not- 

What is it? 

I mean, that's partly my job. It's partly the director's job. Every element works together to make it work. The music helps. The sets make a contribution. Everything works together. It's not hard for that reason specifically. It's hard because it's an enormous responsibility. I feel an enormous sense of responsibility. If I screw up, I'm going to make it look bad for a lot of people. If I don't do the best I can, I'm going to make other people who are giving the best they can not look as good as they can. The buck stops somewhere around my front door and whoever else, like Brad. Brad is wearing the same responsibility I am. 

How do you screw up? 

Making wrong choices for the wrong reasons. Confusing your ambition. Failing to present yourself in working order. There are a thousand ways. 

It's not just the mechanics of not knowing your lines and not knowing your character- 

Oh, no. That's- 

It's something -- It's more than professionalism. It's something about- 

It's a failure to take responsibility for what you do. 

You like the film? 

I like the film. 

Like the moral ambiguities that are there? 

I like the complication and the conflict, and I like the resolution of it. 

Brad Pitt's a good actor? 

Brad Pitt is a good actor. 

Pakula a good director? 

Yes. 

Ford is -- ? 

Adequate. 

Great to have you. 

Thank you very much. Good to see you. 

Harrison Ford. The Devil's Own by Columbia Pictures. Thank you for joining us always. 

Thank you, Charlie.
