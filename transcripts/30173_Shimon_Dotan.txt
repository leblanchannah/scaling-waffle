Good evening. I'm Dan Senor, filling in for Charlie Rose. This week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote on President Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel. Questions abound about the future of U.S. policy in the Middle East, the future of the peace process, and the changing dynamics of Israel and the region. My two guests tonight have each recently made new contributions to the timeless discussion about the history of Israel. Shimon Dotan who teaches at New York University is an award-winning Israeli film director, screenwriter, and producer. His newest film, "The Settlers," premiered at Sundance in the New York Film Festival and is in theaters now. Daniel Gordis teaches at Shalem College in Jerusalem and is author of "Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn" which won the Book of the Year from the National Jewish Book Awards. I thank you both for being at this table. Shimon, let me start with you. A movie about the settlements. It's a perplexing problem, the settlements, that have been around for a while. Why now? Why did you choose to do this now? 

Now is as good as ever. But especially now because I find it is constantly at the center of discussions whenever anybody talks about Israel and the region. And in many cases, the conversation is misinformed. And I thought I would embark on a project that would present the history of the settlements, the ideological and religious elements that drove it, and the reality on the ground today. And I hope the document that is on the screen is a proper representation of this reality. 

Daniel Gordis, your book, "Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn," one could say another book about the history of Israel, what was missing from the discussion that sparked this interest in your doing another book on Israel? 

Actually there is not as many as one would think, but there are a number of others as you point out. I did it precisely because Shimon is right. Everybody is talking about the settlements which is a critical and very complicated problem. But the settlements aren't the whole story of Israel. The conversation about Israel in government, on college campuses, where people live, has become really conflict centric. People want to know, is Trump going to be good or bad for Israel? Was Obama good or bad for Israel? The Iran deal, good or bad, settlements, David Freedman, whatever the case may be, when people think about Israel, they really think about the conflict. But imagine somebody came to us and said, I don't really understand what America is about. I come from a different country. I understand it is a great republic. I know there are really profound ideas at its core, but I don't know what they are. Can you tell me a little bit about what makes America great? And then I said to that person, well, there was a war in 1776. I will skip a few. There was a war in 1812. There was a civil war between '62 and '65. First world war, second world war, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, there are others. But the point is that I haven't told the person anything about what makes this country great, I haven't told him anything about Thomas Jefferson and his dream for a new kind of republic and new kind of democracy. They haven't gotten a whiff of what is in the federalist papers, the way the founding fathers of this country wrestled with states rights and federal rights and so on and so forth. They haven't read Lincoln's addresses long before he becomes president, the Lyceum Address, for example, where he worries about the rule of the mob, or Martin Luther King's letter from the Birmingham Jail. Those are the kinds of things that you need to read in order to really understand what Israel is about. Israel is definitely mired in a conflict and the settlements are part of that conflict, they're an important part. But Israel is really a dream come true for the Jewish people and it has been an extraordinary human accomplishment. I thought it was time that somebody try to tell the story with the settlements and the conflict in the book but not to make the whole story about that. 

I want to show one clip of your film, Shimon. This is a clip of Sara Nachson who is co-founder of the Jewish settlement in Hebron, discussing treatment of the early settlers. Let's take a look. So, Shimon, do you think Sarah Nachson is representative of the settler movement at large in Israel, that they almost proudly regard themselves as obstacles to any kind of accommodation with the Palestinians? 

She definitely represents the early settlers. At a time that she was talking about, it was really a handful of settlers that got into Hebron and they forced their will, led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on the Israeli government. However, the reality today, it's much more complex and it's a completely different population. Out of the 400,000 settlers or so that are in the West Bank today, about 20 percent of them are ideologically, religiously driven and the vast majority are there for economical reasons. 

So a lot of them are very practical. 

Absolutely, yes, yes. 

And in 2005 when Israel did the disengagement from Gaza -- so -- and I know you don't -- 

August 2005. 

August 2005. So is -- the Israeli government orders the IDF to go into Gaza and forcibly remove thousands of settlers? 

Yes, 7,500. 

And what do you think that tells us about the Israeli people and their representative government's attitude towards the settlers? That if there is a possibility, one could argue, to achieve some kind of peace, that they would challenge those settlers? 

Let me put it this way. To my knowledge, there is no point in time when an Israeli government body did an analysis and the strategic evaluation of the benefits that the settlement enterprise yields to the State of Israeli. Quite a contrary, whenever somebody made something like that out of government, the result was that there is detrimental entity to the State of Israel. What happened in Gaza, it was driven, I would suggest, in good part by the fact that it just become too costly to maintain the settlements over there, and Ariel Sharon decided he had to take them out. It was -- I would say this is a proof to the fact that it's possible to remove settlements. But nevertheless, it's a proof to the fact that the government of Israel, if it has the will, it can do that. And the fact that the settlements are all over the West Bank is absolutely an act of the Israeli government. And it's too easy to vilify the settlers and say it's their doing. It's their doing -- and as she said, she wanted to be a bone in the throat of the government. But the government has to be willing to leave this bone stuck in its throat. That's how it behaved for the last 50 years almost. 

But the Israeli government took a risk. They had the will, as you said, Ariel Sharon, to pull out of Gaza. And it was an experiment. And some would argue that what Israel got following that experiment was not peaceful coexistence. But was a Hamas takeover of Gaza, and thousands of rockets being rained on Sderot and even further north from southern Israel. 

When you divorce somebody, it depends how you divorce them. Israel did not create an environment that will allow the population of Gaza to engage in any progress, vis-a-vis Israel. Quite the contrary. The siege over Gaza was strengthened, was maintained, and in the lack of any political horizon, you cannot expect anything different. I'm not in any way defending the Hamas or the Gazan government. But I do think that it is in Israel's power. It was then as it is today to change the set of the preconditions that will allow the progress throughout the political horizon. 

Daniel, could Israel have done more? 

Israel did strengthen the blockade. But Israeli strengthening the blockade is not what caused Gaza to elect Hamas. Hamas was elected pretty quickly after the disengagement. But Hamas is a mess and Gaza is a mess. There is reason that the Egyptians didn't even want it back when they were negotiating a peace treaty with Israel. The more pressing question for peace is the West Bank. And the question is really, is there a possibility of creating what most people I think still want, what I think Shimon wants, what I want, which is a two state solution. And I think what you are seeing when Shimon talks about the Israeli government being unwilling to take a stand, I think it is really the Israeli people being unwilling to take a stand because nobody knows what you are taking a stand on. You can get out of there. But the question is what fills the vacuum? Israelis are worried. They saw the experiment in 2005. I was in favor of the disengagement. I thought it was a good idea. In the end, I would have to say it was a failed idea, that it is good that we tried. Because we learned something by it. Interestingly enough, by the way, Israel's international popularity plummeted right after the disengagement. Didn't go up, as many Israelis thought it would, which is a strange kind of a thing that I don't really understand to this very day. But the question really is, there was a really very interesting comment in the clip of the movie that we just saw where the gentleman speaking before the interview says that the 500,000 settlers have turned into a monster. He uses the word, Hebrew word -- they've turned into the monster that's standing in the way of peace. I think it's interesting what is really standing in the way of peace is what is standing in the way of peace, these 500,000 settlers, which as you both acknowledge Israel could remove if it wanted to, or is what is standing in the way of peace the fact that the Palestinians on the West Bank still basically are not willing to negotiate. As recently as February 2014, John Kerry himself has said that in these very sort of private conversations happening between him and Netanyahu and Abbas, at the end of the day, Abbas just pulled the plug. He expected the United States to push through everything that the Palestinians want and because it was an Obama administration to force that on Israel. When he realized that he wasn't going to get everything that he wanted, he just basically pulled the plug on the negotiations and said, Kerry, at the end of the day, the Israelis made some accommodations in these negotiations. The Palestinians at the end didn't budge. And tragically, that's really been the bottom line story. The Palestinians have done an exceedingly good job of telling a very different tale and of weaving a different narrative. And again, it's important to state, I actually would like the Palestinians to have a state. I would like them to have a democratic state. I would like them to have a thriving economic state. I would like their kids not to have to patrol the border because of my kids and my kids not to have to patrol the border because of their kids. But in order to do that, both sides are going to have to make some very far-reaching accommodations. 

So, Shimon, when you were, go ahead. 

I disagree with you in principle. Yes, we agree on the end results. We both want the same end results. We do appreciate that the two-state is the only solution in the region. But I think that to put the blame on the Palestinian, for that matter, to put the blame on one side, is ignoring the facts on the ground. Israel is the authority in the region. The strongest power. Israel does not face any military threat whatsoever in the region. And because of that, it's its responsibility to extend a hand, to take the initiative. We have to recognize that we live now in the West Bank where the reality is 2.7, 2.8 million Palestinians, in the midst of them, more than 400,000 Israelis. Now, this reality is terrible from the standpoint of Israel, not only of the Palestinians. And to ignore that and to wait for the Palestinians to somehow appease to some of Israel's demand, I think it's quite a short sight of the phenomenon. And if Israel will not recognize that it's upon her to initiate, to extend a hand, to come up with a proposition that will be out of a position of power and stop trying to present itself as a victim in the region, it will never change. And it will last for eternity. And eternity starts to feel quite long especially as we get to the end of it. 

Eternity always felt quite long. But I think you are right in the sense that this has a much wider context. But before we go back to the context, Ehud Barak would tell you that he made a far-reaching accommodation to the Palestinians, that he did give an outreached hand, and that it was rebuffed. Ehud Olmert, subsequent prime minister, will tell you that he made a very far-reaching overture to the Palestinians and that was rebuffed. And Bill Clinton would tell that that was exactly right. You have a sort of a third party who would acknowledge that that's the case. So first of all, I don't buy the idea that Israel has never reached out. I think Israel does reach out. Now, Israel has no military threat to face in the region. That's not entirely the case obviously depending on what fills the vacuum in the West Bank. That's why Israel, for example, is insisting on a military presence along the Jordan River which the Palestinians so far are unwilling to countenance. Israel is insisting on that for exactly the same reason. It's very hard to know what comes across the Syrian border, goes down Jordan, goes across. You and I want the same thing. So let's talk for a minute about why we don't have the world that you and I both want. We both are Israelis. We both care deeply about the future of the country. We would both like the Palestinians and Israelis to live side-by-side. So really, why has this not happened? And I think here is part of the reason that I wrote the book, the book tries to explain that this conflict has a very long history. We're coming on almost a century of conflict beginning in 1929 when over the course of one weekend, Arab rioters destroyed the Jewish community of Hebron which had been in place for literally centuries. And then there was a riot later on in 1936 when the Peel Commission came from Britain. And they decided, they looked at the map, they looked at the Jews, they looked at the Arabs and said, in 1936, the Jews and the Arabs are not going to be able to live together. We have a radical idea, let's divide the land. The Jews thought they were getting all of that land plus something on the other side of the Jordan River, Peel said you are getting a small piece of what is actually even now Israel. The Zionist back then was called the Yishuv, the pre-state -- they were very unhappy, and they said yes. And the Arabs were -- let me just finish -- the Arabs were very unhappy and launched the riots of 1936, 1937. In 1947, when the U.N. Partition Commission began to discuss whether to divide it up and how to divide what the map should be, the Zionists again, the Jews who actually saw this as their national liberation movement. This wasn't about just making a state. This was about ending the tenuousness of Jewish life across the world. It was about saying, we don't want to live that way anymore. We don't want to live in England and then in 1290, when they decide they don't want anymore Jews, the Jews are gonna be gone. We don't want to live in Spain at the highest echelons of culture and philosophy and art, even pretty close to political power. And then Ferdinand Isabella in 1492 decided that the Jews can either burn at the stake, leave or convert. We don't want to be in Berlin in 1933 thinking that we have come to the ultimate home for the Jewish people and find us all basically eradicated 12 years later. I think what the Jews were saying was this was about transforming the existential condition of the Jew. And that's why somebody like Chaim Weizmann who was Israel's first president, when the Jews were debating whether or not to take this much smaller map than they hoped for, he said if it's the size of a table cloth, you take the deal. Because we need just some place to call our own. And I have to say, if somebody on the Palestinian side were to say if it is the size of a table cloth, take the deal, and obviously they've been offered much more than a table cloth. Because what we want more than anything else is to begin to establish our own national sovereign roots. My read of the history and obviously Shimon disagrees, but my read of the history is that at the end of the day, whether it was the five standing armies that attacked Israel in '47/'48, whether it was the Egyptians, the Jordanians, and the Syrians in '67 and '73, or the Palestinians much later, they just have not been willing to say once and for all the Jewish state has a right to exist. This land is our native land, but it's also the Jewish people's native land, and we ought to split it. 

Do you think it is reasonable for any Israeli government, left or right, to expect in return for a resolution of settlement policy, the territories that are clearly in dispute, that the Palestinian leadership and the Arab world recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, formally declare an end to the conflict, and understand that Israel may need to keep some security presence on the border between the West Bank and Jordan. Are those reasonable expectations? Because they seem to transcend party lines, the ideological spectrum in Israel. 

I'd say they are reasonable but they are not a precondition. There is one thing that I would say that's a precondition that we are going to resolve this issue once and forever. But the details of that should recognize Israel as a Jewish state or not, it's an Israeli matter, it is not a Palestinian matter, as they do not ask us, and I don't think it's our place to recognize them, the kind of nationality they want to call themselves. But I want to go back to what Dan mentioned. You were very eloquent and I really appreciated your comments on the virtues of remembrance and forgetting. You give a very eloquent speech on that. And I am somewhat surprised that at that standpoint when I generally do not believe that Israel is facing a military threat, we bring up memories of victimhood and make it an article in the political maneuvers that we're trying to make now. Zionism inception started as a secular movement. Herzl came with a wonderful idea to create a national state for the Jewish people, for one and only one reason, to provide safe haven to persecute the Jews. At no point in time did Zionism aspire to fulfill biblical prophesies or to hasten the arrival of the Messiah. And the main forces that brought us into the West Bank with the settlements was those two forces. And we have to recognize that. So any retreat from the West Bank or allowing the Palestinian to have their own state in the West Bank is the fulfillment of Zionism. It is not the negation of Zionism. I would suggest that the settlements in the West Bank are the negation of Zionism. 

The region seems to be changing in a way that is much different from the status quo that existed for most all of my adult life up until now. You basically have a hundred year order in the region collapsing before our eyes. You have failed states left and right. You have borders that are being erased. You have massive refugee flows that we haven't seen at any time since the fall of the Ottoman empire and possibly the end of World War II. At any given day, you have no idea what government is gonna be in power in many of these Arab countries, like even Jordan. 

Right. 

How does that reality drive the exact debate you two are having right now? Start with you, Dan. 

I don't actually think that it drives it all that much. I think that reality drives Israel's concern about Iran. I think that reality drives Israel's concern about watching its northern border very carefully where there were Russian planes and Syrian planes and Turkish planes and probably some of the -- 

ISIS potentially getting into the West Bank. 

But I don't think that's what is actually motivating this. I think that would be motivating Israel wanting a military presence along the river to try to stop this. Of course it's a concern. Every Israeli understands though, as Shimon said, we're not going to move anywhere unless we are willing to take some risks. I don't think the issue of Syria melting -- Syria melting down is a huge problem by the way because then you have hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of refugees potentially making their way into Jordan, which is desperate for Israel's help to stay stable. I mean, King Abdullah is a closet Zionist in his own way. He won't ever say that, but he knows he is in power in large measure because of that. He is afraid of Iran. And obviously, the Saudis are worried about Iran. And Egypt is worried about Iran. I mean, there is actually, as you said, a very changing map emerging in the Middle East where ironically, first of all in the war of 2014, if anybody had told you when Israel and Egypt were at war in '73, that the war in 2014, Israel's biggest ally would be Egypt, somebody would've told you, you have really got it wrong. But Egypt was actually incredibly helpful to Israel in the 2014 war. If somebody would have said one day a couple of decades ago that Israeli and Saudi officials were going to be in very, very close discussion because of Iran, they would have said that's crazy, but of course all those things are happening. But I don't think that's specifically the issue of the settlements. Yes, Israel needs a buffer and Israel needs to have the protection of the wider space. But I think that fundamentally, I was going back to the history not because of history of victimhood. Going back to the history because the history suggests what is the instinctive nature of the people with whom we have to make the deal, who so far have not been willing to recognize who and what we are. One last point about Herzl, Herzl was, it's true, in favor of Israel as a kind of a haven for Jews who needed haven. But he is not the last word on Zionism. David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, had a much more robust conception of what Zionism was gonna be. It involved bringing a language back to life, it embodied a new national culture. What the Jews have done in Israel is really to transform the Jewish people. That is what I wanted to show in this book. This is not just a bunch of people who moved from Europe or North Africa, came to Palestine and got into a war. This is a group of people who in many waves came to a new place, rebuilt an entire people, one of the grandest, most extraordinary human stories of all time, just needs the other side to recognize that we are also here to stay and put this behind us. 

We just have a minute, go ahead. 

That worked quite well until 1967. I'm sure that you know quite well, probably you too, that in the war of '48, the war for independence, Yigal Allon came to Ben-Gurion and said we can take the West Bank. We can do that. It is no problem. No military problem there. And Ben-Gurion rejected that. He says, what are we going to do with 700,000 Palestinians? So now, we have 2.7 million Palestinians, we have the West Bank, and the question is exactly the same question. So the answer -- 

Is? 

The answer is a two-state solution. That's the answer. 

I think you both agree. So we're out of time. I would say that as a reflection of the health of the Israeli public debate, that you could have such -- two such talented and spirited individuals who don't exactly see eye-to-eye try to hash this out, really tells you about sort of the soul, the soul of Israel. So thank you both for being here. "The Settlers" is the film by Shimon Dotan which is out in theaters now. The book is "Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn" by Daniel Gordis. Thank you both for being at this table. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
