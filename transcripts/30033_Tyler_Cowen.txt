Ian Bremmer:We continue our discussion with a look at the well-being of the American people. Joining me now from Washington, D.C., is Tyler Cowen. He is a professor of economics at George Mason University, and columnist for Bloomberg View. His new book, "The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream," identifies a crisis in social and economic mobility here in the United States. And I am pleased to have him on this program. Tyler, glad you're with us. 

Tyler Cowen:Hello, Ian. 

Ian Bremmer:Congratulations on the book, just out today. And wish you well with it. Look, a lot of challenging topics in this book. The biggest one hits you right in the face, is that the biggest problem we have in the United States right now is that our people are too complacent. Why don't I let you define that for a second just for our viewers. 

Tyler Cowen:People are seeking too much safety and too much security, and at the individual level this is fine, we enjoy safety and security. But at the aggregate level when everyone does this, we end up with a nation which is not sufficiently dynamic. So we have people who are moving across state lines at much lower rates than before. We're afraid to let our kids go out and play. We're overmedicating ourselves. Rates of productivity growth are actually much lower than they used to be. 

Ian Bremmer:So, I mean, I get complacency when you talk about, you know, sort of a middle class, perhaps. I can even understand complacency when you talk about, you know, sort of the wealthy. But when you talk about those that really are upset, you know, those that -- we have populism in the U.S. just as we do in Europe right now, the Bernie Sanders vote, the Trump vote, are these truly complacent people? 

Tyler Cowen:Even for the lower middle class we see a lot of complacency. So there is a new ambition basically to get on disability. Or if you look at data on unemployed young males, it's amazing, A, how many live at home; B, how much time they spend playing video games; and C, how many don't have a drivers license. So the sense of urgency in the lower middle class isn't there the way it might have been, say, 50 or 60 years ago. 

Ian Bremmer:And when you hear these stats about -- well, people aren't staying in the same jobs as much as they used to, Millennials aren't as committed. They'll do three years here, three years there. Are you saying -- is that a wives' tale, is that not really true? 

Tyler Cowen:That's a wives' tale. If you look at actual census bureau data people are staying in their jobs longer than ever before, as best as we can tell. And rates of moving across state lines, that's down 50 percent from its peak. So there are different sociological areas. When you look at information tech, that's our most dynamic sector, but what do people use it to do? To have Amazon ship them packages and watch Netflix at home. Again, it's very comfortable. It's just not all that dynamic from a macro point of view. 

Ian Bremmer:Do you think that's starting to change in the sense that -- in other words, how do you get out of that? The demonstrations that you've seen in the United States over the past few weeks, do you think you're going to see more activism, or is this something that is just a morass that long-term you see no fix for? 

Tyler Cowen:No, long-term I'm very optimistic. But I think this deeply in, the only way to get out of it is to suffer a fair amount and hit all of the bumps in the road. So the return of protests and demonstrations, the rather unorthodox political culture we have in Washington right now, these are a kind of warning sign that the path we were on, the complacent path, it's not possible anymore. In essence, in the broad sense of the term, you just can't pay all the bills. 

Ian Bremmer:So we just had Larry Summers talking about the challenges of making the kind of investments that would be required to lead to real growth for the American worker. If you had policy solutions here that would improve the social contract in the United States, what would they look like? 

Tyler Cowen:Well, I agree with a lot of the policy solutions proposed by other economists, including Larry. But I also think they're asking the wrong question. The right question is why is there so little interest in listening to economists? People are in a kind of denial. They want America to go back to an earlier time, make America great again. They're not willing to suffer losses to their own budgets or situations in life. So it's ultimately a psychological and sociological problem. Not just one of the economists lecturing people more and more. 

Ian Bremmer:Is there a social and cultural issue which is actually quite distinct from the economics here? 

Tyler Cowen:I think the cultural issue is much more important. So there are some very serious wage erosions in America. I don't want to minimize those problems. But actually, America is still a pretty wealthy country. And I think what people are really feeling is a perceived loss of control. And people hate that feeling of loss of control, whether it be trade, whether it be immigrants, whether it be their standing in the local community, the erosion of that community itself, observing an opioid epidemic around them. So it's this psychological issue. People wanting to do something to reassert control again somehow. 

Ian Bremmer:So then, that would imply that solutions from a Trump administration might look very different. That it has a lot more to do with reasserting that control, control over borders, control over identity. Control over families. I mean, do you think that's something that Trump could actually do? 

Tyler Cowen:I sometimes call Trump the placebo president. I think his domestic agenda, he's not sure what it is. I don't yet see that he has the attention to detail to get very much through. He's still not sure what to do about Obamacare. I think his strategy actually is to try to reform discourse and raise the status of neglected groups and tell them, look, someone cares about you. And do that for four years. And in some funny way, that might actually work as a sort of placebo bill for our troubles. And we'll get out of those troubles some other way by growing out of them in some slow and painful set of adjustments. That's what I think Trump's doing, it's mostly about the talk. 

Ian Bremmer:So who do you think is -- I mean, who is getting this right because we're seeing these challenges across the Western world right now. Where do you think and why do you think countries are having a very different experience of their democracies? 

Tyler Cowen:Well, the two countries doing it best as far as I can see are Canada and Australia. And some of that is the residual from having boosts in resource wealth because of China. But with that ending somewhat, they actually do seem to have healthier institutions, more local governance, a clearer sense of their identity. They've made some decisions in the past about accepting migrants. They're the two places where I don't see much of this infection catching on. 

Ian Bremmer:And -- I mean, do you think that there are any lessons that can be learned for the United States from either of those countries? 

Tyler Cowen:I don't think it's easy. Canada in part works as well as it does because it has the United States to rely on. So Canada as a hub of innovation is not very strong right now. It hasn't been strong for a while. In some ways it may even be getting worse. But since they can use and borrow American innovations, they can proceed along some other course and basically use migration to take in high quality professionals. They don't have to do all these grand projects. 

Ian Bremmer:We hear in the United States that it's really, you know, the big cities where you have these extraordinary creative classes that is where you are going to see all the innovation. That's where the people are really mixing. But from your book, it implies that you're saying no, no, no, that is actually just one more indication of the problem. It's all like for like, you're not getting the dynamism even there. 

Tyler Cowen:Exactly. Say you went back to America in the 1920s. You ask, where is the next wave of big musical innovation coming from? Would anyone have said oh, northern Mississippi, the Delta. Hardly anyone thought that at the time. So I think you have to look for places where outsider cultures can still thrive. Oddly in some funny ways, Washington D.C. is becoming one of those. It's such a formal establishment town. But you know, at the fringes, you now have some fair amount of creativity, I think. So we're going to find creativity in this country coming exactly where you don't expect it. 

Ian Bremmer:You are just saying that because you live in the fringes of creativity around Washington D.C. I think. 

Tyler Cowen:The northern Virginia suburbs, yes. (LAUGHTER) 

Ian Bremmer:So -- what do you think about -- does a federal system in the United States, does more decentralization of power, state by state, states' rights, does that help or hinder this process in your view? 

Tyler Cowen:I think federalism is broken. At the moment, I favor it because I feel we need some checks on our executive branch. But people are so poorly informed about what their state and local governments are doing, and state and local voting has become more polarized, more partisan. You just vote for the Democrat or the Republican, no matter how good or bad a job they're doing. That is another thing that needs fixing. 

Ian Bremmer:So what are the parts -- make us optimistic. What are the parts of the American society right now that you would say actually despite all the trends that you've identified, these are places for hope. These are places where you actually think society is starting to get it more right, not less. 

Tyler Cowen:We have two or three big reasons for optimism and I think they're more important than all the reasons for pessimism. The first is just human talent. There is more human talent in this country than ever before. And not everyone, but a lot of those people, actually have a chance to do something. The second reason is essentially information technology. I think up until now we've actually overrated the internet. A lot of it is just fun leisure but the future looking forward, I think, we're underrating it. And slowly but surely, tech will revolutionize every single economic sector we have. There will be big, big losers from that. But also an enormous amount of wealth created. That will be the American future. We're still the leaders. That will transform everything before us given enough time. 

Ian Bremmer:That was two, there was a third. 

Tyler Cowen:I think tolerance, the inherited level of tolerance in the United States compared to our history, to the Civil War, to reconstruction, the Great Depression, the 1960s. In spite of, you know, some comments and some leaders on the national scene, I've never actually seen this country have more tolerance for most people, most businesses, most institutions. 

Ian Bremmer:And would you say that is true despite the great sort that is occurring in the United States right now? 

Tyler Cowen:Yes, and I think we will keep that. I think for all the inflammatory rhetoric you hear now, it's probably part of the process where a lot of groups end up being much more accepted, for instance, Muslims, or if you look at the North Carolina dispute. I think that will go down in the history books as the event that led transgender individuals to really be accepted into America. 

Ian Bremmer:You look at the level of civic discontent right now, but also link that to apathy. Where would you say we're more likely to see civic discontent actually challenge the model in your book, if in five or ten years' time we look back and say actually no, this was -- Tyler Cowen's book was exactly when people started becoming less complacent. They would becoming less complacent for what reason? 

Tyler Cowen:Keep in mind, complacency doesn't work forever. It feels good, it's safe and secure. But you run out of the ability to replenish the sources of your own and your own social creativity. So something stops working. That can be a debt crisis as in the case of parts of the Eurozone. But in the United States, I feel it's been a leadership crisis. We have today an unorthodox leader, no matter what you may think of him, he cannot pretend to really be a leader for all of America. And that's where we're seeing the fraying come first, so to speak. So I think that tipping point for a sociological crisis is actually starting now. When I first started writing the book, I thought that would come maybe, you know, five years from now, seven years from now, but it seems it's actually come in 2017. 

Ian Bremmer:Have you noticed yourself becoming more complacent over the years as a part of this changing U.S. society? 

Tyler Cowen:I try to remain not complacent. And I do a lot of that by foreign travel. My last trip was to Lagos, Nigeria. I feel that revitalized my understanding of the world. But I'm someone who has not moved across the state line in 27 years. Each year I get a year older and vigilance is the price, correct? (LAUGHTER) 

Ian Bremmer:"The Complacent Class" from my friend, the economist, Tyler Cowen. Congratulations. Wish you luck with this, my friend.
