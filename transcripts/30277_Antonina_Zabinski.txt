Jessica Chastain is here, she is a two-time Academy Award nominee. Her new film, "The Zookeeper's Wife," from director Niki Caro, tells a little-known story of Antonina Zabinski. Zabinski and her husband ran the renowned Warsaw Zoo in the early 20th Century during the Nazi occupation of Poland. The couple used their zoo to hide and smuggle Jews out of the ghetto, saving more than 300 lives in the process. Here is the trailer for "The Zookeeper's Wife." (MUSIC) 

Good morning, enjoy yourselves today. (MUSIC) (AIR RAID SIREN) (MUSIC) 

The country is completely overrun. 

They are forcing Jews out of their homes. They are taking us all to the ghetto. (MUSIC) 

Thousands of people are dying, the littlest of children. (MUSIC) 

We have the room. We could hide them. Bring as many as you can. (MUSIC) Oh, the terrible time you must have had. German troops come every morning. You can't make a sound. (crying) (MUSIC) 

Momma. (MUSIC) 

Have you been keeping secrets from me? (MUSIC) 

No one knows how hard it is. You can never tell who your enemies are or who to trust. (MUSIC) Maybe that's why I love animals so much. You look in their eyes, and you know exactly what's in their hearts. 

What have you been up to in your little zoo? (MUSIC) 

I'm pleased to have Jessica Chastain back at this table. Welcome. Good to see you. 

Thank you. It's really good to be back. 

Did you know about this story? 

I had no idea about this story until I read the script. And from there I went to "The Zookeeper's Wife" novel. 

Diane Ackerman. 

Yes, and it's based on Antonina's journals, so that was incredible, because it's been unknown until actually fairly recently. 

Is it a story of courage, compassion, what? 

All of the above. It also, you know, shows another way that someone can be a hero. I think in our film industry, we celebrate the heroes who use violence and aggression and fight, you know? And Antonina uses love and compassion as her weapon against hate. 

And saves hundreds of lives. 

Hundreds and hundreds of lives. In doing so, she sacrifices her safety, the safety of her children, and not only did she save lives, but she bolstered hope and created a space of love with music and art to bring happiness into those people's lives. 

She loved animals. 

She loved every living creature. She lived alongside animals. They'd go in and out of her house, in her bed, her children grew up with animal brothers and sisters, and the film really explores, what does it mean to be in a cage? The Warsaw ghetto is a cage. Also, what does it mean to possess and own another living creature, and Antonina knew that that's not something that makes a society healthy in doing that. 

So she decides to make this -- they take all the animals out, because someone she knew before is going to use them in a Nazi experiment. 

Yes, well, she's been told that they're going to kill all her animals for meat for the Nazis and a friend of the family, who's now the head zoologist for all the zoos -- 

Under the Nazis? 

Under the Nazis, he is a German gentleman, and also based on a true guy, Lutz Heck is his name, he said, I am going to save your animals, I am going to take them to my zoo in Berlin and at least they will be alive and protected. 

He also has a thing for her. 

Yes, you discover that in the novel a little bit, because she talks about how Heck has a crush on her, and in his writing about Antonina, he really admired her work with animals and he admired her greatly, and the film definitely expands on that. 

Did they have you because it's a story of animals, did they have you because it's a story of a woman's courage and commitment to people beyond her own life? 

Well, hopefully all of the above. 

Yes. 

I mean, Antonina is a great inspiration for me of how I would love to live my life and how I strive to live my life. So many people ask, you know, what would I have done back then? 

Exactly. 

And for me, my answer is what you were doing now is probably what you would have done back then. 

The other thing about that idea is, I've asked so many people who have shown great bravery and they simply say, I didn't think about being brave or not brave, I simply did my duty. I simply did what I should have done. 

Exactly, your duty to humankind. 

Yes. 

And to society and to community. And she knew that. I think she knew that from being around so many animals and taking care of them and healing them. She knew that she had to do that for human animals as well. 

Look at some clips. This is Lutz Heck played by -- is it Daniel Bruhl -- offering to take the animals from the zoo. Here it is. 

I see a way out of this, my friend. That is why I've come. You need to listen to me now. You need to trust me. I could take your prize animals to Germany as a loan, we'd give them sanctuary. You know you can trust my word on this. When the war is over, I can return them to you. 

But what if the war comes to Germany? 

A terrible thought, I know, and a personal nightmare for me, but I must tell you the allied forces are very weak. I expect this to be over very soon. I want to rescue the best of your breeds, and I can secure them a future no matter what might come, and we can do this together for Zabinski. We can save your animals together. What do you think? 

Yes. Of course, we must do it. 

I'll bring trucks as soon as I can. Your animals will be fine. I give you my word. 

How did she use that relationship to her advantage? 

Well, because he is in charge of all the zoos, he can help them. You know, at a certain point, Antonina and her husband, Jan, have an idea they can smuggle Jews out of the Warsaw ghetto by collecting trash. If they turn their zoo into a pig farm, once they've lost all the animals, then they can use the trash from the ghetto to feed the pigs. She goes to Lutz Heck and says, listen, we have the great idea, would you allow us to do this? And probably because of his admiration for her, he does allow them to do that and under his nose, that starts the whole -- 

That is how they get them to the zoo. 

Exactly, in the beginning, and then they eventually are able to smuggle them out through the Labor Bureau. 

His views about animals are what? 

It's interesting because he really loved animals, and he wanted to bring back this extinct species of bison, and that is what he spent his life's work doing. He was a failure. He wasn't able to do it, but he was a big hunter, but he also really was into the whole Nazi idea of finding the perfect species or creating the most -- the strongest, biggest animals. So, yeah, he had a very complicated view because he did, actually, the bison that he did raise in Warsaw, now live as wild animals in the forest there. 

Here's a scene from you, Antonina, watching the animals leave the Warsaw zoo. Here it is. (MUSIC) 

My God. 

Wait, wait, please. (MUSIC) You stay safe, my beauty. (MUSIC) 

Put him in Herr Heck's truck. Come. (MUSIC) 

Thank you, Jan. Goodbye, Pagamenska. (MUSIC) 

It's almost like she can relate better to animals than to humans. 

Absolutely. You know, Antonina was born in St. Petersburg and grew up in Russia, and her parents were killed one night coming home from dinner. They were asked to show their hands, and when they didn't have any calluses on their hands, they were shot, because that's how one determined the difference between a member of the intelligencia and a laborer. From that moment on, her life was very dark, and she fled violence, and she found her sanctuary in Warsaw as a young woman. So in a way, Antonina -- well, not in a way, yes, she was a refugee, and she created this space of love and she was able to heal herself with animals, and she knew that power. So when she was able to smuggle in Jews and hide them there and create this safe place, this sanctuary for them, she knew as the animals had healed her, that they would also be helpful in healing the people. 

What are you looking for, when you read the diaries and you're looking for insight into a character? 

Well, anything that the character says about themselves is so helpful, but even more than the diaries, I was so lucky, I went to the Warsaw Zoo before we started shooting, which is still standing, the villa's still there, the basement where they hid everyone. I met with Theresa, Antonina's daughter, and I got to talk to her about her mother and how she saw her mother. She told me things like in her whole life she never saw her mother wear a pair of pants. She was very feminine. I said if your mother was an animal, what would she be? She said a cat. Her father nicknamed her mother Punya, which means "little cat". So all of these things were so helpful in creating, especially for the character, the femininity of Antonina, this woman in 1939, and also kind of the arc that Antonina goes through. In the beginning of the film, she refers a lot to her husband, she is very shy. As often in times of war, when the men leave and the women are left to get jobs or to be the heads of the household, she in a way comes into herself and, at the end of the film, at the end of the story, they come together as equals, and the love is even stronger. 

What was your breakout film? 

Probably "The Tree of Life." 

Yes. 

Yes, Cannes Film festival, Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, not bad dates for the festival. 

And the director was? 

Terrence Malek, one of the greatest filmmakers ever to walk this earth. 

That was when, five years ago? 

We premiered that film in 2011. 

It's 2017, so that's six years ago. 

Six years ago, yeah. I've done, what, 15 films since then? 

I was going to ask, that's where I'm going. Why are you working so hard? 

You know, I just love these stories. Also, growing up, I was always searching for female characters, representations of women in media that would inspire me. Because, you know, little girls, we grow up thinking, or when we're very young, we think we can do anything we want to do, be anything we want to be, and society, because we're not represented in the media, or because we don't have female politicians, or very many CEO's of Fortune 500 companies, or film directors, we then learned that, were taught that it's not possible for us. So I want to create representations in the media. That is why I played Commander Melissa Lewis in "The Martian." I'm commanding that mission to Mars. I want young girls to see these depictions -- 

What's possible. 

And what's possible. Step forward in their lives and not be told that because of their gender, they're limited. 

With pay equity. 

Yes, and pay equity. I think the more confidence girls have, the more that they will, not just be grateful for getting paid but actually speak up and ask for what they deserve. 

And you're doing that now? 

I'm definitely doing it. (LAUGHTER) I'm definitely doing it. Watch out. 

Do you miss Broadway? 

You know, I do and I don't. I do miss Broadway, and I want some way the next time I go back it has to be a comedy. Because the last time I was there, it was so dark. A lot of the films I do are dramas. I am just craving some laughter. 

So you're searching for a comedic part? 

Maybe something old-fashioned, you know, maybe a little, Neil Simon, that would be fun. 

But you work so hard because, a) you love it. 

I work so hard because it doesn't feel like work, right? 

Yeah, of course. 

I don't feel like I work a day in my life and that is actually the danger. Because if you feel like you're not working, then you're not really giving yourself time to rest. 

I wrote a note today basically saying how it makes you a bit humbled to know that you're one of the lucky ones who do exactly what they love doing. 

Exactly. From the moment I was a little girl, once I realized this is what I was going to do with my life, it just was so easy going forward, because I had this dream, I had this goal. So many people I was in school with, it took them so long to find a passion, and many people never really found a passion in life. 

And they find something to do that simply is to do. 

Exactly, and it's work for them. For me, I think that is why I'm so busy, it's because it doesn't feel like work. It actually feels like something bigger than myself and to be in this film with Niki Caro, our great female filmmaker, and -- 

Screenwriter as a female. 

Novelist, female protagonist, we've got female stunt coordinators, camera operators, production designers, there's so many incredible women on this film and to be involved in it and tell Antonina's story, it felt bigger than my life. 

Is Hollywood changing? 

Hollywood's changing in that more people are talking about it and women aren't as afraid as they used to be. We felt like once you start working, oh, I'm so lucky and I don't want to do anything to rock the boat, I don't want people to be upset at me, or the establishment. And now actresses are coming forward and go, I'm noticing this, and female filmmakers are coming forward and saying, I'm not being put up for jobs, I don't even get the interviews. The more we talk about it and not just talk about it, put it into action -- you know, I try to work with a female filmmaker every year, because I know if I'm in the industry, I'm part of the problem. 

Is a female filmmaker different than a male filmmaker or is good, good? 

Good is good. Like women can direct action films and men can direct romance. Filmmaking has no gender. The problem is when you have 90 percent of the films only from a Caucasian male point of view, you don't have diversity in storytelling, and you're only getting one side of life, and the great thing about being human is learning about people who are different than yourselves. 

But you got a little bit of that with "Moonlighting." 

Exactly. "Moonlight" is an incredible film. 

"Moonlight", yeah. 

And to be honest, that was my favorite film of last year, I was so happy when they won -- 

Because of the diversity aspect of it, or because it told a simple story brilliantly? 

Yes, you know, I remember when "Brokeback Mountain" was up for the Oscar and it lost. I thought, how could this movie not win best picture? Is the Academy so old-fashioned? And then when "Moonlight" won this year, I thought, ok, we're moving in a good place. 

It's great to have you here. It is great to see you. 

It's always great to see you. How many times have I been on this show? I love it! 

Not enough. Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
