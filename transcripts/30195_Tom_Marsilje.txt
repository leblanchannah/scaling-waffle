Good evening, I'm Katie Couric filling in for Charlie Rose. In 2017, according to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.7 million people will be diagnosed with cancer and over 600,000 of them will die. That's over 1,600 deaths from cancer every single day. It's a matter that became deeply personal for me when my husband, Jay, died of colon cancer in 1998 at the age of 42. But that was 19 years ago and today there have been a number of advances in medicine that have taken us a long way in the fight against cancer. There are promising new breakthroughs that are giving patients and their families a reason to hope. In 2015, President Jimmy Carter suffered from late stage melanoma; a cancer once thought to be a death sentence, but after undergoing a new immunotherapy treatment, his tumors disappeared and today he is cancer free. But how close are we really to finding a cure for cancer? To help answer that question we are joined tonight by Dr. Bill Nelson. He's the Director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Louise Perkins is Chief Science Officer at the Melanoma Research Alliance. Dr. Neil Segal is the Clinical Director of the Immunotherapeutics Group and gastrointestinal oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. And Tom Marsilje is an oncology drug discovery scientist, and now patient advocate, who was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 40. Welcome to all of you. Thank you for being here. Tom, I want to start with you and your story. You are an oncology researcher working on lung cancer primarily, when in 2012 you had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Tell us what happened. 

Yeah, to start the story, I've always wanted to go into oncology drug discovery since high school because I had a lot of cancer in my family. So I had planned on that for many years. And I started Industrial Drug Discovery in 2003. And I was very passionate about it because I was also an end-of-life caregiver for my mother, along with my sister who died of pancreatic cancer at a young age. And so I took it very personally and very seriously, drug discovery for oncology. And there's definitely a lot of hard work, but also some luck in drug discovery. And I was a part of a project team for ALK-driven lung cancer about 10 years ago now, where I was co-inventor of a drug that eventually became FDA approved, Ceritinib or Zykadia. And it's a dream come true for oncology scientists to have anything FDA approved, it's so hard. And so there's a conference that happens each year in June or May called PASCO, and it was presented by our clinical team and clinical researchers at the clinical trial sites. And it showed an amazing response rate and I was just walking on air because I felt like I was helping my mom, in hindsight, my family members, so many patients. I got to know patients so well. And it was really kind of my one shot, I thought, at really having success. And so by chance, on the same day I had a colonoscopy scheduled for about noon. So I went in for the colonoscopy. They knocked me out for it. They asked me on a scale of one to ten, where to set the anesthesia? I said put it to 11. (LAUGHTER) Central spinal tap. And I started waking up, and I couldn't open my eyes yet but I could hear, and I could hear the gastroenterologist who did the colonoscopy tell my wife next to me, your husband has colon cancer. We need to schedule emergency surgery. So within a six-hour period I went from the highest of highs, to really, the lowest of lows. Later that day I was crying with my wife and I said, there are few things that scare me in life, but cancer is one of them. And it was June 4, 2012, and I'll never forget that date for the rest of my life. And that's true of most cancer patients, they never forget the day they were diagnosed. And so based on my pathology, I had about -- I'd say about a 30 percent cure rate, which isn't great, but that's a lot better than zero. 

I thought stage 3 had a higher than 30 percent cure rate with chemotherapy and surgery? 

Yeah, I had a stage 3-C. I had a lot of lymph nodes. I had invasion into my neurological system. And so I had a lot of things against me. But stage 3 overall is much higher. But I was kind of a worst-case stage III patient. It's one of those things where, as a scientist, I could look up all of these statistics myself. 

They say you shouldn't Google anything when you're diagnosed with cancer. 

You probably shouldn't, but I did it immediately. 

I'm sure as a scientist, you wanted that. 

And I knew what these actual warning signs were from my pathology. But, obviously, I was very upset and scared, but really clinging to that 30 percent hope. Because, 30 percent, it's not great, but that's real hope. And so I went through chemotherapy for six months. I had a clean CT scan at the end of chemotherapy, and my life just turned around. It was really -- I reprioritized my life in a lot of ways. I felt like I had dodged a bullet. I started -- I was always relatively active, but I became a long-distance runner. And then eight months later, I had my next CT scan and there were enlarged lymph nodes. And at that point we weren't sure it was cancer. Lymph nodes can get enlarged if you have illness for various reasons. And so I was in this weird purgatory where I didn't know, was I stage 4 or was I stage 3? And my cancer, it was very very slow-growing. And so we actually watched it on CT scan for almost one year, where the lymph nodes would get a little bit bigger, and that would be a bad news scan. They'd get a little smaller, that'd be a good news scan. So it was a yo-yo effect. 

But during that period, you were getting no chemotherapy? 

No chemotherapy, no treatment, just monitoring. Because we didn't know if I had cancer or not. I didn't know. My doctors didn't know. So, psychologically, it was a very challenging time because, as I said, it was almost like purgatory. I didn't know which direction to go to because I knew if I had stage 4 disease I would become a fighter and do everything I could to combat it. If I was cured, I kind of wanted to move on with my life and I was kind of stuck in the middle. But after about a year of monitoring, we had a couple of scans in a row that showed consistent enlargement in lymph nodes, and eventually a couple of spots on my lungs. And so then I was restaged with stage 4. 

And what kind of chemotherapy -- you then went back on chemotherapy? 

At that point -- once you're stage 4, there's a lot of -- it depends a lot on the patient and the doctor where you can use a lot of leeway. Because I was not surgically receptable, and so I like to use the phrase currently incurable, because I look at things like melanoma where people were considered incurable ten years ago and now they're doing fantastically. But I was currently incurable at that point, and since I have such a slow growing disease, I decided, well, I'm having a really good life right here. Why don't I put off chemotherapy for awhile and just keep monitoring it? And my doctor is a fantastic oncologist and he agreed to that plan. And so I went for a year without chemotherapy and continued monitoring. And then I eventually went back on chemotherapy once enough spots had grown where we kind of made a judgement call, and we had to kind of weigh the quality of life with treatment, and I went back on chemotherapy. 

You have been an extraordinary inspiration to so many people, Tom. I know you've started a blog, or you've been writing a blog called Adventures in Living Terminally Optimistic. You have helped many patients sort of navigate the clinical trial system, which can be quite confusing. Why have you done all that? What has that given you? 

For two different reasons. So I started with a personal blog, Adventures in Living Terminally Optimistic. And that started because when I was first diagnosed, the first thing I did almost was go to Google and find a blog. And it really gave me a lot of comfort. And the blog that I went to, I loved it because it was both realistic, it talked about cancer in very harsh terms, very realistic terms, but it always had hope involved in it. And it brought me so much comfort that -- originally I started a blog when I was diagnosed with stage 4 because I wanted to keep my family updated on medical things, but I didn't want to bombard people with emails if they didn't want emails of my updates, so I wanted to do something where they could choose to look at a blog. And originally it was going to be a private blog, and at the last second I decided to make it public, for this reason, because I imagined a new patient being diagnosed and going to Google and needing comfort, and I wanted to pay it forward. I had gotten help from someone else's blog, why not pay it forward to the next person? So it became public and I wrote my first blog piece. And all of a sudden, this thing that had been planned to be a medical update to my family turned into so much more, where I very quickly realized, within basically the first post, that I had a very unique viewpoint. I was a scientist and so I knew really up-to-date information on science because I was approaching clinical trials. I knew a lot about clinical trial data that was coming out. 

So you could basically translate it because when you're thrust into this world of cancer, unless you're trained like the three of you, and like you, Tom, it's like suddenly learning a foreign language. 

Right, exactly. And it's one of those things where I knew this information and I wanted to help other patients, and I decided, well, I can write about this in layperson terms. And so then it became a real mixture of a blog where I alternate. I go back and forth between personal stories, which are my own cancer journey, and, once again, harshly realistic terms. So I talk about chemotherapy, I talk about vomiting in the chair. You know, all the emotional things. I have a family, obviously, young kids. But then I alternate with posts that are scientific posts that are in layperson terms. And really it was meant to really just kind of share with my fellow patient population the things that I knew, because why would it be fair for me to know these things and not share it with my good friends? Because I'm friends with these people. And I think the two things really played off each other very nicely. And it was somewhat by design, but it definitely took off more than I expected, where there are other places to get trial information or science information in layperson terms, but when a fellow patient reads about it from someone who knows what they're going through, can see it through their eyes, who has skin in the game, it just makes it so much more powerful. And so my little blog started taking off and I now have tens of thousands of hits per post. I am in 140 countries. I'm in six languages. 

Wow. 

Actually, my biggest viewership is actually in China, in Chinese, where everything is translated by a group of scientists where I work who are Chinese immigrants. And I get so many messages from people that it's been so rewarding, and that was really just the start. I then realized there was limits to what a personal blog could do and I started working with a couple of organizations, so Fight Colorectal Cancer I work with and I became their in-house scientist called the Currently Incurable Scientist and I write for them and work with them on really educating patients in layperson terms through their network, basically, which is much more than a personal blog can do. And then we may want to talk about it later because it's a pretty big topic, but then I started working with an organization called COLONTOWN and the COLONTOWN Clinic, which is basically a private community where we talk about colorectal cancer trials 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year in a conversational tone. And I recruited fellow scientists that have a personal connection to CRC, or colorectal cancer. And basically we give them information that trials are opening up because it's very hard to find the information normally. 

Yeah. 

And really the real purpose is to then explain the trials in layperson terms, and so we have more than one professor in immunology to talk about immunotherapies. And so -- in this private setting and it's Facebook based, so it's conversational, so a two-way street. And the patients can then go to their medical oncologist with a couple trials that they've been made aware of, which is very hard to find without some help. And they have a basic understanding in layperson terms. And we also supply PDFs of background literature for the oncologist to read, and it's been amazing. 

Well, you're amazing for doing all this and helping so many people while you're going through your own cancer ordeal, and I want to talk about a couple of the things that, Tom, you raised with the folks assembled here. And one is, you were 40 years old when you were diagnosed with stage 3-C colon cancer and there was a study out recently led by the American Cancer Society scientists, Bill, that showed that the incidence for colorectal cancer -- colon and rectal cancer, is going up among people under the age of 50. And of course 50 is the recommended age for screening, unless you're symptomatic, as you were. So tell us a little more, Bill, about this study and what your reaction was to it. 

Well, this is a report from the people who keep score of who gets cancer in the country, how old are they, where do they live, are there differences between men and women, are there differences in different race and ethnic groups? And there was a lot of good news in the study. What we're finding is that colorectal cancer mortality, broadly, has been declining, particularly in folks above the age of 50 who get screened. Not all of them on live television, but the people who get colonoscopy and whatnot, there's clearly a benefit so overall it's getting better but -- 

The screening rates, compliance rates, have gone up. 

That's right, screening rates are going up and the survival rates are improving. The worrisome thing, though, in the same report card, is that there's an increase in colorectal cancer incidence, people getting the cancer, and in deaths from the cancer in this younger age group. They're not -- we were talking about this earlier -- they're not the people typically getting screened because they're younger than age 50. I don't think anyone knows for sure what the reason is, but some of the things that we know contribute to colorectal cancer: obesity, some dietary habits and the like, maybe this millennial generation has a little bit more of those risk factors for colon cancer, so they're getting them at slightly younger age and that's worrisome. We need to figure out a way to help. 

According to the study, compared to those born in 1950, those born in 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer. And the press release that came with this study said: "Our finding that colorectal cancer risk for millennials has escalated back to the level of those born in the late 1800s is very sobering. Educational campaigns are needed to alert clinicians and the general public about this increase to help reduce delays in diagnoses which are so prevalent in young people, but also to encourage healthier eating and more active lifestyles to try to reverse this trend." Neil, one of the things that came out of this study was a discussion about the screening recommendations. Right now, the American Cancer Society and other organizations, I guess, recommend screenings start at age 50. Some organizations, 45 for African-Americans, who have slightly higher risk. Do you think the screening age needs to come down for colon cancer screening? And rectal cancer for that matter? 

Well, Katie, I think that studies like this are exceptionally important to focus our attention on the increased incidence in various age groups, and this is the type of data that the folk that guide the recommendation for age of screening will use to make a definitive recommendation. Studies like this will start the conversation, they'll take it one step further deciding what that screening age should be, and that's the one that we'll follow. Of course there are certain populations with higher risk features that should have screening at lower ages, particularly family history, for example, symptoms, as was mentioned earlier. Those are specific types of indications, but overall, will depend on the analysis of this data. 

And what do you think is behind this increase among younger people? 

That's a very good question. I don't think we know just yet. That article made the point of healthy lifestyle is important, diet may be important, exercise may be important, but there are potentially other factors that are changing the incidence of colon cancer and rectal cancer in a younger age group. But us knowing that this is becoming a problem will prompt discovery into what is the underlying cause. So we're just at the very beginning of answering that question, I think, at this point. 

Not to be too graphic, but one of the things that I've discussed with doctors about this study is the importance of digital rectal exams, and that many doctors and many patients don't want to get those done because they're uncomfortable or whatever. But that's critically important, isn't it? When it comes to diagnosing rectal cancer, in particular? 

Yeah, rectal cancer -- you're talking to somebody who was a prostate cancer doctor for a long time, so digital rectal examinations are something we use very frequently to look at that space. But I think the key is going to be if there's going to be more cancer in this generation heralded by more cancer at a younger age, we need to get on top of this. Just as Neil was saying, we need to figure out, what are these risk factors? Can we deploy public health maneuvers to make them better? And then can we -- I think we're going to develop new screening tools. If we can find DNA on a hair follicle at the crime scene, can we find cancer DNA in the circulation, in the stool, or something like that that's not full on -- 

Or a blood test where it's not nearly as invasive as a colonoscopy. 

That's right, and use that. And I think those things are on the horizon. I don't think they're this year or next year, but I think they're coming. 

I'm always worried to talk about that though, Neil, because I'm afraid that will discourage people from getting screened with the tools that are available today because they're waiting for something on the horizon. 

Well, I think the topic of screening tests is a very emotionally charged topic. There's a lot of implications of what is the right age to be screened at? Nobody wants to not get screened at the age that they should be. But we have to recognize how likely the screening test is to identify the cancer, and what are the downsides of screening in a lower-risk population? What could the false positive rates be? 

Right. 

What could the implications -- what could the financial costs be? What could the costs of additional testing be? 

Let's talk about younger patients and melanoma as well because it is really increasing among younger women in particular. What can you tell us about that? 

So melanoma, like most cancers, is a cancer of aging. It tends to happen in people in their 50s, 60s and so on, but melanoma is unique in that it is the most common cancer among young women ages 25 to 29. Now why is that the case? Perhaps it's excessive exposure to ultraviolet light. We know that if you look at the DNA sequence of melanoma from sun exposed sites, that is, ultraviolet light exposed sites, that you can see the footprints of DNA damage in those melanoma cells. So it stands to reason that ultraviolet light played a role in causing those melanomas. So why, if you're a young women, would you jump into a tanning bed where they're going to bombard you with ultraviolet light? And it may well be, although I don't think there's any data to support it, that high exposure to UV light is playing a role, in this high prevalence in these younger women, of melanomas. That said, I think another factor that could potentially play in is that nobody expects somebody in that age group to have a melanoma. And I suspect that some of these folks are underdiagnosed before it becomes a terribly aggressive situation. 

And that's something that's true in colorectal cancer as well. We talked about screening already, but another thing, I'm glad that we're getting some exposure and getting really unsaid heresy from that study, is that I was lucky. I had symptoms and so I had a good gastroenterologist who immediately ordered a colonoscopy when I got to that point of the treatment flowchart, but unfortunately, there's a lot of doctors out there that are undereducated that it is possible to get colorectal cancer if you're under 50. And a lot of people -- 

There's something like 11,000 cases a year, by the way. 

Yeah. And so I know many people that had symptoms, and had symptoms for one to two years, that went to their PCP and their doctor, and were really not taken seriously and even asked for colonoscopies, and were not given them. I think because of undereducation that it is possible, and -- 

I'm sure you heard story after story of people who had blood in their stool who were basically told they have hemorrhoids. 

Exactly. I hear those stories every day. And what I think really is kind of the worst aspect of it is that younger people that are diagnosed with cancer -- colorectal for sure, probably for melanoma as well. You can correct me if I'm wrong. But they tend to be diagnosed at later stages because of the diagnoses screening, they're not taken as seriously sometimes with symptoms. And so for younger colorectal cancer patients, they're often diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4. 

In my husband's case, it was stage 4. I mean, he had metastatic colon cancer and it was all over his liver by the time he was diagnosed. 

Which ties in directly to survivability rates and all those statistics that are feeding into that study. 

What can we tell people watching this at home who may have cancer or have a loved one who has cancer and they're desperate for information about clinical trials and they just can't find them, they don't understand necessarily when they're eligible? 

The key to understanding clinical trials is ongoing communication. And that communication sho
