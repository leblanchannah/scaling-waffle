Natan Sharansky is the Israeli Minister of Industry and Trade. After spending 9 years as a political prisoner, he immigrated to Israel and founded his own political party. His new immigrant party captured seven seats in his first Knesset elections. He is a long time friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was one of his coalition partners in the Hebron agreement and I am pleased to have him at this table. Welcome. It's good to see you again. 

(inaudible). 

Long time. In the middle of the night, before. 

Yeah. 

I want to talk about your trip back to Russia where you spent some of the most difficult years of your life and you went back and visited your father's grave. First, politics today. Where do you think your Prime Minister wants to go? Much has been written about the fact that when he signed the Hebron agreement, it was evidence of the fact that he had signed on to the process, and yet when he went and promoted settlements in Jerusalem, he was taken two steps back from the peace process. Tom Friedman used the words, he's got to make up his mind where he's going, because he's crossing the Rubicon, but drowning halfway. What say the Israeli Trade Minister? 

Not understand where he is going. Let's say where he went. The last 9 months, I recommend you to remember what people are thinking the day before the elections in Israel and in Washington. The messages which are the staples (inaudible) that if Benjamin Netanyahu wins elections, that will be the end of this process. They will warn him against Nehewan the elections. Nine months after this, there is redeployment in Iran. There is further re-deployment after Iran. A decision was made. The agreement of prisoners who enrolled in terrorist activity, the negotiation with Arafat. Then there was the debate whether to agree to meet with Arafat. This nine months is together many things which people in his own camp, people who helped him to be elected, who brought him to power. Even Netanyahu said that he's going to continue his process and he's doing it even in spite of the fact that he has to pay big political prize in his own casualties. The challenge for the leader is not simply to go ahead. The challenge for the leader is how to, especially in the democracy, is how to bring public opinion with you. The former government went so quickly in the way of peace process. They made so many concessions. That wasn't with them. 

Well, some would argue that it wasn't because they went so far to make concessions. What was worrying them was that the terrorism and safe on the streets -- 

Of course. For sure. But that's exactly what Islam did when they were going ahead with the peace process to have to make sure that there is a secure way and that's exactly the problem. It is very important -- 

But it's not secure. It's not secure today. You've got some of the people -- 

It's not secure, but for the last nine months, let's say we have been more cautious, a different speed but also with much more security. What I want to say is that you cannot expect for Bibi Netanyahu no no you can't expect. His challenge is, how to go ahead and at the same time to build broad consensus in support of his course. He is making very difficult effort to move the peace process from the right remand (distribute) route to the middle of the political step and to get support of the people. For this he must have to also make things which enjoy this concerns. Now lets look at what he said, the building of the settlements and of course it's not the building of the settlements. The building of Al-Ahmad we are talking about barren empty hill in the principle borders of Jerusalem between two Jewish neighborhoods between Gilo and Ramat Rachel. 75% of this lands originally belong to Jewish, 15% to the Arabs 10% to the church. They were all bought by the Israeli government at the end of the 80s when decision about this project was made. In the times of the Rabin government, all the legal procedure were finished. The buildings in Jerusalem reserves that all Israeli governments beginning from golden years we are doing that's the question which enjoys the broad concern among Israelis. It sums that no is Israeli government any agreement which restricts its rights to building in Jerusalem. Minimum step Bibi Netanyahu has to do in order to have support of the--to have consensus around his political (inaudible). 

Okay. Let me stop you for a second. There are those who would argue the following, 75% of the Israeli public opinion is in favor of the continuation of the peace process and Netanyahu seems more worried about the 25% that are not than the 75% that are. He ought to quit worrying about the right-wing of his own party and get on with where the majority of the public opinion is, which is in favor of the peace process. 

It is ridiculous to say that he is worried about the 25% if everything practical that he did from the moment that he was elected as a Prime minister was to anger this 25%. Some of the 25% were saying that they were for peace process 

With security, and more security. 

Majority of them or rather majority of this 75% want Bibi Netanyahu to continue building into Jerusalem. Not that there is no contradiction in this continuing peace process involving Jerusalem it looks like a natural part of this. Yes, there are 20% or 25% who support peace process for scrapping building in Jerusalem. It's clear that Netanyahu has ignored them exactly as he has ignored his allies or the people who voted for him on the right-wing. He really has to build centers, more centers coalition in support of his process. 

He has to build it or it is already there? 

Oh well, he has to build support in his wing in continuation of the peace process. He didn't have support of the last because they were against him from the beginning. He lost support of an essential part of his right wing camp who were against those steps that he did. He needs support of the center and definitely for this support he has to continue doing what all Israeli governments were doing, building Jerusalem. 

Okay. I meant that someone prime minister with the president of Egypt on this program last week said, "We're building up more settlements than Netanyahu has built." He also argued that Rabin always did something to send signals to Arafat. It looks like Netanyahu is now doing that because he is allowing passage between Gaza and Jericho. He is allowing planes now limited number to fly into Gaza which he did not even allow King Hussein's plane to fly into Gaza. He is making some co-sessions on one hand while he is with his left hand doing the settlements in order to advance the process. Do you read that way or am I-- 

Well, I have to say that it will take the list which was prepared by the American negotiators aside those who were helping us in negotiations. List of reciprocity measures which both sides have to do you find out that practically everything that is that is written on the side door is an obligation as I was doing. You have mentioned only two of those points which we oblige to start negotiations. If you look on Palestinian side practically nothing is done. Amendment of the charter, arresting of Palestinian terrorists, leaders and giving them to Israeli's, destroying activity of commerce and other terrorist organizations and many other things. If we are talking about signals which are sent by maybe Netanyahu to Arafat and Arafat to maybe Netanyahu it's still unfortunately one movement to one direction. 

You are here to argue and to say that, "I am there on the ground and I am telling you, and I am telling America that Netanyahu is making more co-sessions for peace than Arafat is." 

Well, definitely he is-- 

Is that what you are saying? 

I am saying he is making constant steps in the direction of peace and he is-- sometimes he is even sacrifism the sacred principle for himself during his campaign sacred principle when he was saying that each time when we are making some step we are expecting the same from Arafat. 

The people in his own party like Shamir has already written him off. Has he not? I mean Shamir-- 

That's exactly what I am saying when he is moving ahead he is losing essential part of his own campaign supporter. I don't know about Sharon but definitely Shamir. People of the right wing do not want any co-session and that's why I think it's very unfair to say when he is doing this big effort against the will of those who brought him into power against the will of many those (inaudible) taking him. In generous effort to move this process ahead at the same time he is attacked as the one who is trying to destroy this. 

In part, you are saying he that what he is doing is betraying those people who elected him in part. 

Well, some of those people who elected him hope that he will stop this process, some of those people who elected him hope that he will continue with peace process but will take care of the security and other needs of Israel in a much more powerful way. That's why I am saying that he has now to build new majorities partially from his old supporters and partially from those who supported labor in the past. 

Is he going as far on the side of the peace process as you want him to go? Is he doing everything that you think he ought to do to further the peace process? 

I think he has a lot to do to further peace process and if there is criticism and I have criticism not only I have criticism during the discussion of the first deployment after boldly voted against. The reason I voted against-- 

You mean the 9% of-- 

Yeah. They said they have no problem with 9% or 7% or even if it will be 11%. I have a problem with the fact that we didn't formulate our strategy to the end. Arafat made it very clear what was his strategy. He said, "I want now 90% of western bank, I want to stop building in Jerusalem," and then come to final stage of negotiations. 

Isn't it that what Oslo says in the end too? 

Oslo agreement doesn't say anything about 90% or 10%. 

I want to object there is a process in which the Palestinians will gain control of most of the west bank does it now? 

It says that there would be steps if we further the deployments. It's not defined how big these deployments will be. It states that in the end of this process Israel will control the security zones, roads and so on. How big security zones are that is not specified. 

It laid down a free stage process after Hebron for deployment. 

Of course. It was made clear by the Americans and the others that as Israel we should decide what would be the size of the steps. What I said to Bibi Netanyahu was that we cannot continue moving ahead in making even one more step for ourselves if we didn't decide what we needed to reach in the end after we make this three steps. That's why I think the that time has come not simply to make tactical move. Not simply to think how we will continue negotiations in the next one month but what we want to reach in a year or in two years and in accordance with our strategic aims to decide about our tactical moves. Lets-- this is a grievance which we can work out hopefully disagreements now are disappearing because we also understood the necessity of formulating a strategy now. 

You seem to be saying that-- tell me if this is what you were saying. That we have to think about what is the final strategy, what the end game would look like, it's what you were saying? 

Exactly. As a chess player I even tried to explain this in chess terms at the whole meeting of the government. Why it is important that in the middle of the game you already have a strategy until the end. In fact, one of the ministers when I was explaining it, said, It is so difficult why not to play checkers? I said, "That is exactly the problem if Arafat is playing with us chess and we are playing checkers." 

Arafat knows chess does he? His goal is clear he wants a Palestinian state on the West bank with Jerusalem as its capital. 

Absolutely. 

That's what he wants. 

He formulates clearly his strategic aim and each time he is trying to move through another way to Israel. 

What do you think Israel's game goal ought to be? Because more people believe it seems there ought to be some form of Palestinian state on the West bank. 

I kind of agree with you about some form because it's not the-- 

You kind of agree with that? 

It's not the roads that matter it's the powers that matter. What kind of power this Palestinian authority will have. As I was telling them many times I am ready to give to Palestinians all the powers in the world except one, except the power that is why we have to take care about our security, about our strategic interest and that is why it is going to be 90% South Western bank can not be 85% South Western bank. I think we need to formulate what is the minimum interest-- 

Pressure is not about territory either, is it? I mean the power to destroy you is not about whether they have 85% or 90%. It's about something else. 

It's also about territory because we must have strong defended borders. It is also about those powers Palestinians cover that whether they will cover opportunity to bring army or ammunition from Libya or from Iran to the borders of Tel Aviv-- 

Whether they have fire or provisioning and all that. 

Or what? 

Planes coming in. 

Planes without control coming in. You mentioned the airport he is not resisting, he has agreed to have an airport. All he is insisting on is right to control like on every international border to control what is in their planes. 

Why would you let King Hussein land? 

Well, because Arafat succeeded to link King Hussein when in this nation when I think King Hussein himself didn't understand. He wanted to create a president where the aero plane would come without any control. Then based on this president he would try to say then my personal aero plane will be coming and so on. We said we are ready to give you the airport, the airfield where you will be bringing hundreds of aero planes everyday, but we are not ready to do it without our control. As of every international border, we want to see it as our international border on which we are controlling if there are weapons on board, if there are terrorists on board and so on. 

Okay. In the end, you would never agree to a Palestinian capital in East of Jerusalem? 

That's rather important. That's the core of the idea. Jewish state that Jerusalem, which by the way never was skeptical about of any other country but Israel for thousands of years but it's history. Will be undivided capital of Jewish state, we haven't taken cause of that, our interest and vested interest of different religions so these sacred places have to be controlled by the representatives of the regions that are sacred. Places for Muslims it can be Palestinians, it can Jordanians, it can be Saudis, it can be all of them together or control this places as if they are something different but it should be the capital of Israel. 

No joint sharing of the city of Jerusalem. 

I don't believe in joint sharing of capitals. But there are other places where their capital can be. 

Are you optimistic or pessimistic? 

Well, . 

By nature you have to be optimistic. 

By nature, I'm very optimistic. I only think that it's not a good situation when we feel that we have something to gain and to lose from this process. And Arafat feels that he can only to gain. He can also start feeling that he can lose. And looking for compromise . 

The conventional wisdom is that Rabin and Peres have learned how to deal with Arafat. Learned to negotiate with him. Understood him. Understood . 

Look, it was relatively easy to start this process. It's much more difficult to continue. Rabin and Peres agreed that all the questions that are difficult we'll postpone. We will not decide. Even if it was Peres who win the last elections, it would be very difficult for him to continue. One more thing, from the very beginning, this peace was born in sin. This sin was full confusion of the concept. Rabin was, Peres was talking about new Middle East without the borders. Rabin was talking about separation of Jews from Arabs because we cannot live together. It is very difficult to make it at the same time compatible. Full separation and new Middle East without the borders. 

Peres' idea was that there would be in the new Middle East all kinds of economic advantages of the two peoples to live together and that was the advantage of everybody. As soon as you establish those kind of trade relationships things would get better off. 

As the minister of trade and industry, the moment they came my minister said that one of my top priorities is to create this new kind of economical relationship between us and Arab countries. We are working constantly on this and I have to say that the biggest problem is that all the time Egypt and Palestinian authority and to a less extent Jordan, are making direct linkage between economical cooperation. Which is first of all dangerous. And getting political advantages in the peace process. I think that's a big mistake. 

On their part? 

On their part. 

Going back to . You have a lot of power over there because you've got those seven seats and the coalition could get very shaky. I mean it couldn't have made it -- Well, they had enough votes on Hebron in the Knesset. 

No, let's put it this way. The government cannot exist without us being the partners in coalition because the government is basically the coalition of 66 members of Knesset. Seven of them are (inaudible) and sixty-one that is the majority that is needed. Without our support, coalition cannot exist. 

It gives you a lot of power. 

That's what we hope we will get. Because we believe it's very important that new immigrants will feel themselves equal member so the society. To be equal members means to be responsible also for the most important decisions of the nation. 

You went back to Russia and visited your father's grave. Was it hard for you, or had your sort of long ago come to grips with all of that. 

The trip to Russia wasn't bad. It was interesting. The moment of visiting my father's grave maybe was the most sad and difficult because really, when my father passed away I was in prison. Not only I was isolated from the world, I couldn't go to my mother and to be with her in those days. It was some of the most difficult days of my life. I chose the line from the psalm, for his grave that his soul will lie in peace and his seed will inherit Israel. That was like the dream sent from the prison. Now, sixteen years after this, I am coming to his grave where I never was and see the stone with that words that I asked that be written there. This really became true, but he cannot enjoy with us. He cannot see that this dreams became true. That struggle to which he was sympathetic but he was so afraid for my life and whether I will survive it. And I am there and I am in Israel and he is not. It was rather sad. In general, the trip to Russia for me was very symbolic. 

A business trip, really. 

Officially . Officially it was business trip of the trade minister who wants to increase trade relation with Russia. It was very successful from this point. We came with a big delegation of seventy industrialists. We had a big seminar. We met with seven ministers. Industrialists made a lot of good deals. But on the other hand, I think I was the first minister in the history of Russia who was not to visit Bolshoi Theatre but to visit prison. I think I was the first person ever in Soviet Union who was afraid to be late to prison because of my tough schedule. I was almost late. I was in a hurry to go there. When I went to that KGB prison where I was arrested and put in the punishment cell twenty years ago and now coming to the same punishment cell. Very small room like this table. Very cold, very dark. Three pieces of bread, three cups of water. And to think that since then, the time when I was in this punishment cell, more than one million Jews left the big punishment cell call the Soviet Union. And soviet Union as a regime doesn't exist anymore. That was something very sweet and rewarding and symbolic. 

And you had no . Because the powers that be that had created those prisons that held you, those people were out of power. They were gone. 

I was asked after I went out of the prison and journalists were asking me whether I forgive that regime or whether I hate this regime. I said I was never fighting with this country or this people. I was fighting with a regime which doesn't exist anymore. It's dead. I have forgiven that. Of course you're forgiving them, but they lost already. What was really important for me during this visit to see is that the country didn't change much, in fact. In spite of all that I hear, it didn't change much. But the people changed. The people are absolutely different. When you are talking to the people, you see there is no sense of censorship. There is no fear which was controlling every step, every word of the people. 

To speak their word, their mind. 

They are speaking their minds. You see, when people are already free. For ten years they already seduced to freedom. That virus of freedom which we are keeping in prisons alive went out and caught all them so they already ill people. They are free people. So you can't really now take it back. 

As an American expression, you can't put that genie back in the bottle. 

Exactly. And that's what was most optimist about it. 

To know that, that spark of freedom had established itself no matter how many problems with economics you're having. No matter how much problems you're having with organized crime. No matter how difficult the economic reform is. 

The country has a lot of problems and first of all, there is no clear separation between politics, economy, armies, social life. It's still very far from normal legal system of the West. The normal democracy of the West. It's very unstable in the top but in fact, the country is stable because the people are free. There is no way back. With all the difficulties, look at what will be in ten to fifteen years from now. I'm sure it will be again big powerful country. For us, the West, it's very important how close this country will be to the free world. That's why it's very important now to keep all the channels open and to cooperate and to encourage privatization. To encourage pluralism. To encourage development. 

Aren't we doing that? Isn't everybody doing that? 

Well, I think . 

Or not enough? 

We are not doing enough. I think we lost some very important years in the very beginning of this process. 

During the Bush administration after the Iron Curtain fell? After the Berlin Wall fell down and all that? 

I remember those meetings with then-President Bush and some others when all the attention was concentrated on how to help Gorbachev to survive. How to keep Soviet Union in one piece and how Gorbachev will control it. I was very critical about it. I was saying there is now way to stand on the road of people to freedom. They will be free. It will fall apart. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Try to develop relations with different levels of that country. And I think Russia will be playing important role in the future in the future world. But nevertheless, my attitude to Russia is mainly pragmatical and not the attitude of love and hatred. 

How do you feel about NATO expansion? 

I think it's important. 

It's good? 

I think it's important. I think it must be done in a way. In not aggressive way. 

So they don't see it as at threat? 

Well, they will see it as threat anyway. We have to keep the channels of communication with Russia open but we definitely . I think the West has to expand their cooperation with all those nations that are on the border with Russia. 

I always wanted to ask you this: How do you explain you when you were sitting in that Gulag that you were able to survive? And you kept your spirit. No one who knows of your story will ever forget your last act of not walking in a straight line to say to them . 

Because they said, "Go straight." I said, "I never do what you said." 

How do you explain the fact that you never, ever . What is it about the human spirit? 

I'll tell you. For the first twenty years of my life, I was a slave. I was a loyal Soviet citizen who tried to become successful scientist. And for this, he lived the life of a slave. He was thinking one thing and saying another. Then I started life as a free person. I said, I am a Jew. I want to live in Israel. I want to fight for my rights, the rights of the other people. I became a human rights activist. The important thing is the moment you start saying what you think, you finally feel yourself free. The more you feel yourself free, you feel yourself also strong. You feel that you have history, you have wants, you have future, you have people with whom you are connected. You have country where you want to live. And that was such a big difference between change between being as if free, but in fact slave. But then being free person that even when you're in prison, you don't want to go back. And when the KGB proposes you compromise. You know the moment you start compromising with them, you will lose your inner freedom. You don't want to lose it. You want to continue being a free person. Then of course, you find out that there are so many resources inside you which help you to be strong. Simply people don't know how many resources they have to be really free. To be in peace with yourself. To do things which you really believe. People don't know or are afraid to rely on themselves. I think this feeling, this desire to remain free and through being free person, to be in contact with people who are dear to you. With your wife, with your country. With the future, with the mankind. This feeling was very strong. And that was giving me strength to fight. And also understanding that the moment you make even small compromise, you are losing this unique feeling of freedom. 

It's a pleasure to have you here. Natan Sharansky, a powerful story. Thank you for joining us.
