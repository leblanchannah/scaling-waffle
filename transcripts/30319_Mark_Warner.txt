We begin this evening with our continuing coverage of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The Senate Intelligence Committee held its first opening session today. The committee's Republican and Democratic leaders promised a thorough and impartial inquiry as doubts mount about what happens in the House investigation. Meanwhile, "The New York Times" reported that two White House officials helped provide Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with reports indicating surveillance of President Trump's associates. Joining me now from Capitol Hill is Senator Mark Warner. He is the ranking Democrat and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We also have asked Chairman Richard Burr to join this program and we hope he will do so soon. Let me begin with the question of today's testimony, what is the takeaway from what you heard today? 

Well, today's testimony focused kind of on the foundation. What did the Russians do, why did they do it? This is part of Russian doctrine that goes back to the Soviet era of spreading misinformation and disinformation. They've just now taken it to a much more modern space in terms of using cyber techniques. So it was revalidated one more time, which I think everyone with perhaps the exception of the president, accepts that the Russians were behind the DNC hack, the hack of the John Podesta emails. They were behind the use of distributing fake news. And the way they do this, Charlie, is they have close to a thousand paid internet trolls in Moscow that create in effect bots that can then flood certain of these search engines like Twitter and Facebook and others with a lot of false news, real fake news, not the kind that the president has sometimes referred to. And there was complete consensus from both the technical experts and the more kind of historical and policy experts, one, that Russia was behind this. Two, it was based on the assumption that Russia was trying to create havoc and chaos and they want to try to split countries apart and try to drive as big a social wedge as possible. And obviously, if you look at the 2016 electorate in terms of some of the tools they used, they did that. There was a lot of the websites they pushed and promoted were ones that were viewed as far right, lots of the words and usage of those words reinforce those kinds of views. What also I thought was a little surprising to hear some of the witnesses say is that part of the reason they were successful was that then candidate Trump used some of this fake news in his normal comments about fake numbers of people voting, about some of the other outlandish claims that Mr. Trump made as a candidate, and said that that actually amplified the fake news. And the truth is, we live in an era now with great benefits from technology, but we're now seeing where the manipulation of some of these particular technology platforms can really create national security risks as they did in this attack on our election last year. 

The committee has subpoena power? 

Yes, yes, it does. 

Who do you expect to hear from? 

Well, what we're doing, unlike maybe the other committee, is we believe we need to do this in a deliberate, methodical process. I'm going to tell you as somebody who is impatient to say the least, this isn't happening nearly as quick I'd like. We've even got some of the intel community that still needs to get us at full access to their underlying documents. What we want to do first is go through those documents. We've gone through and had our staff out reviewing thousands of pages in the three binders that created the January 6th intel report that, again, reached the same conclusion about Russian interference favoring Trump and against Clinton, and also in terms of some of the possible connections particularly between the Trump campaign and Russians before the campaign. And there's a lot of smoke out there in those issues. What we want to do first is go through the documents. We're starting interviews next week with some of the intelligence analysts who have created those documents, and then we'll get to some of the names that are being bandied about. People who have been, indicated they wanted to testify. We've only released one name actually that we'll plan on calling and that is Jared Kushner, the president's son- in-law. But we don't want to call him until we can get a lot of this preliminary work done. 

What do you learn from the way the House Committee conducted itself? 

Well, Charlie, I've learned that when we're dealing with something as explosive as a foreign adversary, intervening in a presidential election, and when the ramifications of that were at the heart of our Democratic process and possibly there may have been some level of collusion, conversation, ties, between some folks affiliated with the Trump campaign and the Russians, the only way you can do that is you got to do it bipartisan. In a country that is in many ways, as split as ours right now, if we were to come out with a report that wasn't bipartisan, then it wouldn't have credibility. And I've been, again, I'm not going to comment on a lot of the specifics on what's gone on in the House, but it's been pretty bizarre behavior by some of those characters. 

Bizarre meaning? 

Well, bizarre meaning that at least the press reports of the chairman of that committee going down to the White House, and perhaps getting information via White House employee and then coming back the next day and briefing the president before he shared it with any members of his committee. That's just not the way the intelligence committee in the Senate works. Our responsibility first and foremost is to follow the intelligence wherever it leads to make sure that we do this in a bipartisan fashion. And to make sure that the intelligence community cooperates with us. We owe that allegiance above anything else and that's how we're going to try to conduct ourselves. 

Is this in part because of the relationship between you and Senator Burr? 

I think part of it is. We've known each other for a long time. We're social friends. But I also think it's because every member of the committee, Democrat and Republican alike, we've kind of agreed that we're going to all jump together on this. If it comes out that there is nothing there, I will be the first to go out and say that. If there is something there, we're going to follow the intelligence wherever it leads. And I think one of the things that's helped Chairman Burr as well as been the strong support he's had from people like Susan Collins, and Roy Blunt, and Marco Rubio, and James Langford, all who've been right there saying, hey, we've got to do this right. But I give a lot of credit to Chairman Burr as well. This is tough for both of us, and from a political standpoint, but he agrees with me that we're going to follow this wherever the intelligence leads. And we've got to do this the right way. 

It's too early obviously to make a judgement when you're just beginning this. But you have seen a lot of the evidence so far, have you not? 

I have seen a lot of the underlying evidence that went into the January 6th report. I've also seen some of the materials around the so-called dossier. I've also seen that that raises a whole lot of other questions. And then I've seen press reports that indicate, boy, oh boy, there is a lot of smoke here. I'm not ready by any means to say there's fire, but there is a lot of smoke. And again, if the White House -- if we were to believe the White House and they've done nothing, then you would think they would want to get out of the way and actually help this investigation move forward. 

So in other words, if they have not done anything, they should be the first. 

Amen. And I think the jury is out on that. 

What's the most troubling about this for you? 

Well, Charlie, I just say that, you know, we've never had this kind of extraordinary intervention by a foreign power. Vladimir Putin didn't do this to help Republicans versus Democrats. He did it to make America weaker, economically, socially, in terms of our political system, weaker. And I've candidly been a little upset that there's not been more general outrage from the public. I know there is a lot of news coming at folks every day. But we can't accept this as a status quo. What we've seen Russia do in other countries beyond intervention is literally going into legislators websites and plant false information. Like suddenly they go into your website and put some child pornography and then call the media on you. That's -- you know, that's just not acceptable and what they tried in 2016, they're trying right now in France and in Germany, number one. Number two, we have -- that kind of adversarial attack on America, we have at least the allegations that there were members affiliated with the Trump campaign who had a number of contacts and potentially had some kind of collaboration. We don't know that yet, by any means. But it troubles me when we've seen a national security advisor have to resign already in a young administration because of his previously undisclosed ties with Russia. We've seen the attorney general have to recuse himself because of his previously undisclosed ties with Russia. We've seen people that were affiliated with the Trump campaign as advisors, one in particular who said he tweeted that he was familiar with the WikiLeaks folks. He was -- he predicted the Podesta email leaks weeks ahead of that time, and then said he has been in contact with Guccifer 2.0, which is a persona that was created by the Russians as one of the agents to distribute this false news. That troubles me greatly. And, you know, it seems like every week there's a couple more names that pop up that we've got to run down. 

Have you seen evidence that the Russians provided information to Republican officials in the Trump campaign, gave them information that they could use as a negative way against secretary of state Clinton. 

Charlie, I'm not going to comment on classified information I've seen at this point. We've got a lot more fact gathering to do. But one thing I do know, and part of the challenge here is we've got to protect the intelligence community, the men and women who serve -- not only the people, but some of our techniques that we use to gather this information, so some of this has to be done in private. But if we're going to prevent this from happening again in the future, we've got to be more transparent than ever from this investigation. And that's why I've been pleased that we've got much wider access, some of this information usually only goes to what's called the so-called "Gang of Eight," which is the leadership in the intelligence committee, committees, and the speaker and the ranking member, we've broadened it to our whole committee. But they've got to get a lot of the additional information that I've seen, and frankly a lot of the information that I look forward to seeing. 

So you have seen a lot more information than we know about, A, because it's classified, B, because it was only sent to the Gang of Eight. 

I'll simply say this, Charlie. I said this before. When I started this process a month and a half ago or so, I said I thought this was the most serious thing that I have ever tried to take on in my public life. I've been a governor and a senator. I feel much more strongly the truth and validity of that statement today than I could have ever imagined when I first made it a month and a half ago. 

Senator Warner, thank you so much for joining us. 

Thank you, Charlie.
