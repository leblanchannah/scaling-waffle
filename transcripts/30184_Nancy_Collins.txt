worked both on and off stage and has been delighting Broadway audiences. And finally, we'll look at the man behind the myth of Christopher Columbus and talk with a man who's recreated some of the explorer's journeys. The media world is in flux, from network television to news magazines, radical changes are in store everywhere. Who's succeeding in this brave new world and who's rising above the ever-increasing tide of information? We talk now with three journalists, Nancy Collins of "Vanity Fair," Kevin Goldman of the "Wall Street Journal," and James Ledbetter of "The Village Voice." They all cover the world of media. And we'll talk about who's next, who's to watch, and who might be in trouble. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

Jim, let me begin with you. Talk about news magazines and what's happening. Here I have my copy of "Newsweek." This is not this week's copy. But I look at sort of the two news magazines that are most identifiable to audiences here. What's going on at both of those places? 

Well, at "Time Magazine" there was just a huge round of layoffs, got a fair amount of attention. It was inevitable. The company itself is bloated. The company is in tremendous -- carrying a tremendous amount of debt still from the merger with Warner Bros. And the "Time Magazine" itself was hit as hard as some of the others, a few dozen layoffs. But, more importantly, they're about to undergo a huge redesign that they're keeping under lock and key. 

A new cover for Time? 

I don't know if it's so much a new cover, but a new look on the inside. Hard to tell because they won't give out any details. However, we can assume a few things; one, that they'll go for more visual impact, something along the lines of a "USA Today." That's inevitable. The entire industry is moving in that direction. So it seems -- 

"USA Today" has had that kind of impact throughout the world of print media? 

No question about it. There's a joke definition that "USA Today" is the paper that all editors and publishers say they don't want to be like and then they tell everyone that works for them to go out and be just like them. Strange because it's still not a profitable enterprise, because it's very expensive. However, graphically speaking, it's had tremendous impact and will continue to do so. 

Are they losing audience, those two magazines, just simply because of the impact of television? 

Well, these figures are very highly charged. You know, they came up with something called readership a few years ago, which is not measured by anyone but is simply a number they pick out of the air that says, "Well, we have x number of subscribers, but because y number of people see every issue, we really have z number of readers," which is, you know, usually something like more people than live in this country. But they're certainly losing their impact. There's been a tremendous shift in the function of the newsweekly in the last few years. It's thrown it into something of an existential crisis. They don't know if they want to be a journal of opinion. They don't know if they're just a rehash of the news the way they were for years. They have to compete with CNN. They have to compete with the changing function of newspapers, because the newspapers are competing with CNN. So they're shuffling around. They're trying to change the formula a little. And I think, ultimately, you know, over the next few decades it may be kind of a doomed form. 

Is this the hottest magazine in America today? 

Yes, it is. 

Oh, why do you say so? Because of the -- 

I write for it. 

Is it? You think so Kevin? 

Sure, absolutely. 

Tina says that she wants people to look at this and say, "I got to read this magazine, every story." What makes it good; Kevin? 

No, I was going to say, you want to read every story. There's a mix. There's celebrity interviews. There's usually a scandal. There's usually a murder story, a true crime story. 

Something about the rich and troubled? 

Right, and there's naturally stuff about the media in there, heavy on the media. 

I think -- Tina Brown, we're talking about the editor of the magazine, refers to it as a cabaret, and I think the idea is you go in and you have, you know, the hors-d'oeuvres in one room and your main course in another, et cetera, et cetera. 

And the cover sells it, doesn't it? "Jessica in Love" is a story you wrote? 

Yeah, that is my cover, yeah. 

When you approach these profiles, is it different writing for "Vanity Fair" than it is other magazines? Do you have more time? Do you have better editors? I mean, is it any different than any other? 

You have less time at "Vanity Fair." It turns around real fast. I mean, that's the excitement of it. We have a satellite dish that enables us to have a faster -- a closer to deadline cover for instance, like when in this piece, in this particular issue, there's a piece on Boris Yeltsin, which Tina put in I think a week before it came out in stands. 

Yeah, I remember that. 

And I think -- I don't know. I'm probably -- you know, Ted Koppel once said that you can always judge a society by the people that we idolize. And, of course, I guess if you look at the covers of "Vanity Fair" for the last -- 

Jessica Lange. 

Jessica Lange, and we do idolize movie stars. 

Barbra Streisand, all those people. 

Yes. And I think those people are there for a reason. Not only do they sell magazines, but I think that movie stars or celebrities are the natural extensions of many of our secret desires. I think, for instance, when you think about the fact that movie stars still, age 56 to 57, demand and get all the attention they want, that's every kid's dream. That's never growing up. But I think in our heart of hearts we have the nerve or the narcissism to push ourselves out there. Or as Jack Nicholson once said to me, "You know, Nanc, if you want your face up there six garages wide you got to pay the price." Well, you know, we all want our faces six garages wide. 

"Wall Street Journal," how is it doing? 

The "Wall Street Journal," oh, it's doing very well. 

(Inaudible). Peter Kahn said. 

That's right. No, it's doing quite well, and we've expanded our media coverage to answer the demand, I think, by readers to know more about the media. I cover television. We have another gentleman covering newspapers and magazines. Someone else covering the record industry. 

Why doesn't television do more coverage of media? 

I think television doesn't know how to. I think television hasn't gotten -- is very scared to, doesn't know how to cover business, and because it's very difficult to cover business in two-minute or minute-fifty-second packages. And therefore it's just confined to covering the celebrity part of it in shows like "Real Life with Jane Pauley" or the old "West 57th" show or something like that. I just don't think that they know how to cover the business of it yet. 

It's more than business. I mean television also doesn't deal with the editorial side. They don't take on magazines and newspapers. In fact, most magazines and newspapers don't take on the editorial side in any kind of confrontational way. 

That's right. The CBS Morning News a few years ago tried to cover -- hired someone to try to cover newspapers as aggressively as newspapers -- 

Is that when Jon Katz was executive producer? 

This is when Jon Katz was the executive producer. 

A former newspaper man, yeah. 

And Ed Joyce was the CBS news president. And there was a totally failed experiment. They just couldn't -- 

Because there was no interest or they couldn't make it happen? 

They couldn't make it happen. They couldn't make the pieces interesting, compelling. I mean, this is an unusual television show in that it doesn't rely heavily on graphics. It's four talking heads. 

Right. 

Very unusual to have this sustain in television. There's no whiz-bang graphics coming along. There's no dancing music. 

That's because we believe in talking heads here. But you would think that -- I would suspect that at the Voice, your column and Doug's column is one of the things that people turn to early on. 

Absolutely. 

I'm serious. 

That's what people say. I think that's in part because -- 

It's like personalities used to be in "Time Magazine" or the first -- 

I'll take your word for that. 

Yeah. 

I mean, I think it's, to a certain extent, not to inflate the role, but it can function at its best as a kind of ombudsman or ombudsperson for the city, for all the city papers. But that's easier to do on a city level than it is to do on a national level, like you were talking about CBS News. I mean, there's so much out there on the national level that it's virtually impossible to even imagine someone digesting it all, much less presenting it in a way that's as compelling to a person in Chicago as it is to someone in Alabama. 

Right. There was a big controversy at "Philadelphia Magazine" a few months ago. The editor was dismissed. 

That happens every week at Philadelphia Magazine. 

That's right, because -- 

Because of the confrontation with the publisher. And that's just -- outside of Philadelphia that just has no interest, very regional, whereas the networks you can get into controversies much better because everyone watches 

Speaking of that, size up the television race so far in primetime. 

Surprising enough, CBS, which has been in the cellar for the last four years, is doing very well with three weeks into the new season. And they're doing very well in households. But what really counts, the real race is demographics, men and women 18 to 49, that's the group that advertisers like most. 

And CBS has taken that group? 

And CBS is doing very well in households and in women 18 to 49. It's still having problems with men. ABC is doing quite well still with men 18 to 49. 

What's the hot new show this year? 

Monday Night Football. 

The one that we're opposite, which is Monday Night Football. 

Yeah. 

There's also a show on ABC called "Home Improvement" which is just a regular sitcom but it's sandwiched into a good -- 

It's great placement. 

That's right. But other than that, there are no hot shows this year. 

Where's Fox at? 

Fox is doing very well. Fox is beating the three networks on two nights of the week, Sunday with the help of "Married with Children" -- 

And "In Living Color." 

And "In Living Color," and Thursdays with "The Simpsons" and "Beverly Hills 90210," which is the hottest show on television. It is taking every teen practically in America and lots of other young adults. It's Aaron Spelling who gave us "Dynasty" and "Charlie's Angels" and other mindless stuff. 

Critics have written interesting things and applauded "Brooklyn Bridge," and the new one that just premiered on Monday night, what was that? 

"Northern Exposure." 

"Northern Exposure," no, the people who created "Northern Exposure," also created - 

"I'll Fly Away," it's the new Sam Waterston show. It's a rip-off of "To Kill a Mockingbird." 

Yeah, but is it good? 

It's good, yeah. Tom Shales killed it in today's "Washington Post." 

He didn't like it? 

No. He just killed it. But it's very slow and lots of good natured people. 

Because John Leonard raved about it on Sunday morning. 

That's right. Well, the networks have now taken tried and true equals dead and buried, which was the credo last year, and all the networks started these great experimental shows like singing cops and they all failed. 

"Cop Rock." 

"Cop Rock," and they all failed. So now we're back to 1950s retro television dumb sitcoms. 

I saw today where Van Gordon Sauter is going to be America," which is not an >>ABC News presentation but does a lot writing for your old newspaper: Van Sauter, the former president of CBS News, is "20/20," that the '90s was to be the year or the decade of ABC, that Arledge had somehow put it together. And you saw him flash all those faces across there, from Barbara Walters to Peter Jennings to Ted Koppel. -- So you did a great piece for home once in 

It's going to, but the troubles that -- 

Why isn't it - why is it automatic? 

Well, it's not automatic. ABC News and Roone worked very hard to slowly build that team from nothing in the 1970s. New York Magazine. From ground zero he build that organization. Yes, he raided 

Thank you. "Nightline," for all intents and purposes, should have been on 

That's right. CBS because CBS was such an innovator in broadcast journalism. CBS dropped the ball then. And "Primetime Live," which has taken two years to find itself Van Sauter is going to take on the television networks. I think his contract with CBS just ended last month. 

They had been paying him all these years? 

All these -- he signed a five-year contract about a month before they fired him, and it was just paid out. but it finally has. "20/20," another show that's found itself. And now he's teaching a course in journalistic ethics at So, Roone has worked very hard. I do think that the same problems that affected NBC News Stanford out there in California, and he's now joining and CBS News are soon going to be on the door of ABC News. Variety on a -- 

And his wife is now the treasurer of California, Economic problems? 

Economic problems. 

Don't forget -- don't forget Ken Auletta's and many people predict will once be governor -- will one day thesis too, which is that Capital Cities is the only one be governor. of the companies that owns any of those three networks that has 

You know, the interesting thing about the some experience with what news is about. media, and I actually think there's a lot of media coverage 

Because they've been running local stations before they bought the network. 

That's right, but Cap Cities just placed, with Roone's approval -- 

An executive vote who is said to be looking over -- making sure that they keep their expenses in line. 

And you'd be very sure that he -- that Steve in the media, because the media loves to write about the media Weiswasser, the executive that was put in, is indeed going to do that. 

Because he's said to be a man destined to be the chief executive officer? 

He is probably going to be -- he is in line to be the president of ABC. 

I understand Murphy is coming back, Tom Murphy, this legendary man that is written much about. In fact, Warren Buffett calls him the best manager he's ever seen. 

He's never really gone away. 

He's always been there, huh? 

He's like Frank Sinatra. 

That's right, yeah. 

What do you think of local news, Jim? Mike Wallace just made a big speech before, what's it called the RTNDA, the Radio Television News Director Association, attacking the tabloid direction of local news. Is it? 

The direction? and we love to read about each other, alas. What -- And every piece I've done in my career, the ones that people 

Yeah. 

What did it ever have previous to that? still come up to me and say, "God, I remember that piece," I think, you know, it's sad because I -- was six years ago when I did the cover of "New York Magazine" 

But it's a broad brush to say all local news has that. 

Well I think all local news is, at best, mediocre. with Ted Koppel and the Van Gordon Sauter piece. In most cases it's not -- they don't do a terribly good job of covering anything local. And Van's long gone, and people still remember those two pieces They take the top five crime stories off the wire and they read them, and there's your evening's news. out of almost all of the pieces I've ever done. I think -- you know, I put something in my column a week ago. You know, we went through a huge charter change in New York City. Because they have such huge impacts on our It was written about for years. And we finally had the first city council elections. In the local newspaper, there was virtually no attention to lives. it. Van Sauter shaped the CBS News we are seeing now and Ted Koppel Now, if local news isn't going to cover that, well who is? I mean, part of the problem of course is you're dealing with stations whose markets reach into Connecticut and Westchester, which people don't care particularly about the New York City Council elections. 

But then they shouldn't care about a beating death of someone in the Bronx. helped lead ABC News into the supremacy that it enjoys today. 

Precisely. Precisely. But it's -- 

But that's very emotional. 

It' unfortunate because there are a lot of talented people, or there have been a lot of talented 

But those are still personality pieces. people working in local news. We simply aren't given the chance to do any kind of serious work because the time, the budget, and the interest on the 

Yeah. part of the news directors is not there. 

I mean, what I'm talking about is you don't see, And they're also shrinking. Local channel four used to have two hours of news, it's now down to 90 minutes. 

Well, what they do is they transfer it to "Live at 5" and these celebrity-oriented segments. for example, the "New York Times" set out to do a story on 

What's the impact of CNN? 

Enormous, and I think it continues to be even more so. I mean, Ted Turner really deserves a lot of credit for how the press covers labor issues, or how well are we that, because do you remember when he first started everybody dealing with the healthcare crisis in terms of what kind of thought this guy will coo-coo. information people are getting through what sources. But he has been so brilliant and I think he's handled it brilliantly. And I also think that he hasn't changed it, you see. He really hasn't made it into a face of stars, which any network would have done. 

Charlie, your old show "Nightwatch" was put on 

Because he was worried to death that Turner was going to -- 

All the networks are putting on live late local newscasts overnight in order to stop the affiliates from going to CNN and CNN Headline News. 

Let me just come back, because I don't want you to get away with the notion of the "Wall Street Journal." Hasn't there been some, I mean, decline in percentage of growth or something like that with respect to the growth? 

Telerate. 

Help me out, Jim. 

Telerate was a little disaster that the "Wall Street Journal" acquired last year. 

Dow Jones. 

Excuse me, Dow Jones acquired last year, an electronic media service that has, I suppose, we could say charitably yet to meet its potential use. 

Well, fortunately, I cover television, so -- 

All right, let me come to the "Daily News" and the Any kind of self-criticism -- "New York Post." The "Daily News," now that Maxwell is there, what's the impact? 

But do people want to read that stuff? 

Well, it's become a very good publicity organ for Robert Maxwell. 

Yes. Surprise, surprise, surprise. 

There was one day last week -- or two weeks ago now, when his picture was in the paper five times in the same 

Well, we can't know until we try. day. So he's done a very good job of promoting himself. I mean, I think that it's a way of engaging people. Arguably, that's necessary to keep the paper alive. I mean, when I do it I get a lot of response, some of it quite I think that's the thesis, that if you personalize -- sort of like your thesis - if you personalize the paper and make negative, but it's still response. people really care about -- So some people clearly do. 

But I happen to think also, that issues are only 

It's Maxwell's crusade to make the news a player in New York. 

You know, they promised their advertisers that by the end of September they'd have a million readers on Sunday, guaranteed. people blown up, and to get people interested in an issue, Those numbers, audited numbers, have not yet come in. Those will be very closely watched in the industry. Maxwell said if it's not profitable by the first quarter of '92 it's going to bye. And given the way his empire is being run across the globe, which is to say badly, I don't doubt him. 

Yeah, he's really having to cut back because of his debt. 

Tremendously. Tremendously. 

Is this magazine going to change it all now? 

In terms of what? 

Because the '80s have changed, because it's a different decade and all magazines evolve, is this one evolving at all, "Vanity Fair?" 

I think so, because obviously the players you have to get them interested in the people involved in the that made it important in the '80s, most of them are out of business these days or in prison or -- 

You mean Michael Milken or? 

Mike Milken, all the kind of major '80s players are no longer the players of the '90s. So I think, A, we're defining the players and we're thinking about this a lot. I mean, Colin Powell is certainly an interesting guy, and Schwarzkopf has more than had his day in the sun, so we know those two guys are going to be around. But in terms of who's going to sell magazines, you know, it's funny, we all want the same 12 people. We wake up in the morning and say, "Do you think Mick Jagger will talk to us today? 

And they all have Mike Ovitz as their agent. 

This is true. 

But we'll still never see a politician on the cover of Vanity Fair. 

Well, Gorbachev. 

Well, you know, I have to tell you, I don't issues. think that that's true. I think that if there was one that was interesting and hot I think Henry Kissinger was a classic example for our enough and sexy enough, absolutely, they'd be on the cover. 

If there was. generation. I had no idea what foreign policy was until Henry got on 

If there was. 

Yeah. 

We have to find them. 

Do you see anybody on the horizon that that first plane and went from Egypt to Jerusalem, and so might be that hot? 

No, but I'll tell you who's a great interview is Bob Kerrey. 

Yeah. Everybody says that. 

Yeah, he's a great interview. 

He's got mystery going for him, doesn't he? 

He's got mystery, and women just love him. 

Thank you very much, Jim. Thank you, Nancy. Thank you, Kevin. We'll have to do this again. As we go, I want you to take a look at tap dancing with Tommy Tune and Gregory Hines. And then we'll be back.
