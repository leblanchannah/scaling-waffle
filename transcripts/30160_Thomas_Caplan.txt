There are a few people Bill Clinton calls in the early morning hours to talk about movies or poetry. Tommy Caplan is one of them. He was the president's college roommate at Georgetown. After graduation, he went on to Harvard Business School. In 1979 he became a novelist with his first book, Line of Chance. His latest effort, Grace and Favor, is the story of a merchant banker who finds himself caught in the midst of blackmail, murder and scandal. I am pleased to have him on our program. Welcome. 

Thank you very much. 

Nice to have you here. 

Nice to be here. 

Now, let's just-- as we tape this, they had a little book party for you last night in Washington, given-- I think hosted by James Fallows-- 

And his wife, Debbie. (sp? ) 

--and his wife, Debbie, at the-- well, wherever they had-- their home? 

At their house, yeah. 

At their house. Jim Fallows is the editor of U.S. News & World Report. 

Yeah. 

Among those dropping by, the president and the First Lady. 

Yes, that's true. Extremely flattering and very touching. 

Yeah. But had they read the book? 

Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. They read the book and I'm pleased to say they, you know-- 

They liked it-- (crosstalk) I'll talk about the novel in a little bit, but it's hard to talk about novels as-- as-- because the people don't know what you're talking about-- 

Sure. 

--and you don't have time. But let me talk about you and your life. 

Okay. 

Tell me about this friendship with the president of the United States. (crosstalk) At the time, no two people could be more different. You meet at Georgetown. He's from Arkansas. 

Oh, I think two people could be more different because we had a lot of the same interests. 

Okay. 

And we also-- 

But you came from different places. 

Yeah. I came from Baltimore-- 

Right. 

--and he came from Arkansas. 

Right. 

But I think we met because we had something very deep in common, which was the last-- our last names began with the same letter. We-- 

So you were on the same floor. 

Exactly. And we had believed, actually, for 27 years, all of us-- five of us later became roommates and lived in a house our senior year-- we believed that the university had selected, as they told our parents, you know, those that we would live with based on geography and difference of background so we would have broad exposure. Twenty-seven years later, when President Clinton began to run for office and a lot of us began to be called by reporters, we discovered that on our floor there was everyone from Bastienne (sp? ) to Duffy, (sp? ) I think. So ''C''-- Caplan-- 

Yes! 

--Clinton-- it just-- (crosstalk) 

There was no method there. It was just simply alphabetical. 

It's actually a very good way, probably-- 

Yeah. 

--to do something random, by the alphabet. 

And what happened? You met. You liked each other. You-- 

Yeah. 

--shared a curiosity about-- 

We met. We had great interests in common. Principally, we'd both been fans of President Kennedy, who had just died the year before. We'd both been a little bit shaken by that and before that got inspired by him. So we had that in common and we were interested in foreign service curriculum, public service, taking the same courses and, of course, you know, we're 18 years old, so we became friends. 

And the friendship-- 

Has lasted. 

--lasted over the years. 

And it started immediately and it's never really flagged. And not just with me, but, I mean, all of our roommates and some others, of honorary roommates, have remained in touch for all these years, which is one of the really gratifying things in life, to have-- 

Now, is he a letter writer? 

Yes, indeed. Yeah. 

A phone caller? 

Yes. 

Keeps up with the lives of his friends. 

Yeah. I mean, there was a long period of time when he was living in Arkansas and all of us were living in different places. I mean, me either here or in Baltimore. There were other people-- roommates of ours in Jakarta, Madrid. One didn't see each other. You know, one-- very often. But since he's moved back to Washington, we've seen him more and it's been great fun. 

How often do you go over there and-- 

Oh, in fits and starts. Sometimes not very often and then sometimes there'll be three or four things in a row. 

What does a good friend serve for the president? I mean, what does a good friendship do for the president of the United States, somebody that he can take his shoes off and somebody-- 

You'd have to ask him. I mean, it's just-- 

But you must understand because you're-- 

Sure. I mean-- 

--part of it. 

I think-- I think it serves the same purpose it does for anyone else in the world, just to have people who know you as you are and, you know, like you very, very much and have had many shared experiences and will sort of see you through the best times and the lowest and-- and who have faith in you because they know your strengths. 

This has been written about some. I'm not asking you to say something you haven't talked about before. I mean, he called you in very difficult times. When the going would get tough, he'd call and-- 

Yeah. I mean, he's done that. I've called him in difficult times in my own life. I mean earlier. Not now, really, so much, because I don't like to burden his time and I haven't had difficult times recently. But I mean, as a friend, just to be there-- but I think it's wrong to overstate my role because a number of people who are great friends of his and (unintelligible) a little differently (unintelligible) He's got many friendships which have lasted from Arkansas and from a decade before I knew him, who remain his friends. 

Do you think the person that you see portrayed is the person you know? Is the conception-- is the perception of the president by the media, by the American public the same? 

Very often, but obviously not always. I mean-- 

What do we miss? 

Well, let me restate what I was trying to say. I'm a novelist. I earn a living by making up things, but making up totally fictional characters. So sometimes when I see reports of the president, which I recognize immediately as complete fiction, I find it distressing. 

Because it's out of character for him and-- 

Yeah. Because-- I mean, yes, the man I know and the man who has been a close friend, as I say, not just to me, but of just lots of people for a very, very long time and who we all know to be a sort of a wonderful, sympathetic, absolutely unpretentious, decent and very, very empathetic person, a person who has-- one of the really attractive qualities of the president, in my opinion, is his deep interest in other people's success. He really likes it when something nice happens to his friend. And so that's-- I mean, you said he came last night to the book party. I mean, this is very minor on the scale at which he usually operates, but it's-- he takes a palpable joy in my book coming out or Tommy Campbell's (sp? ) flying or just the successes of children of friends of his and that, of course-- 

Yeah. What will he do when he leaves the White House? 

That's a good question. Your guess is as good as mine. I think he'll have to write because he'll have to record his years and his thoughts and maybe, you know, even his life as it led up to that. Beyond that, I suspect some element of teaching. I haven't the vaguest idea because I think he's so focused right now on what he's going to do for the next three years that-- 

What do you think that he wants the legacy to be? I mean, this is the other question that I suspect they think about. 

Maybe-- 

Not so much what-- ''How can we make a difference in the next three years?'' ''Legacy'' tends to make people believe and I suspect they reject it, too-- makes people believe that, oh, you're sitting there thinking about ''how history is going to record me'' and therefore you're not doing anything that's important, if you're focused on that, if you're obsessed with a kind of egomaniacal-- (crosstalk) I'm not suggesting that at all. 

You know-- 

But you do suggest, I think, if you've been reelected, you know, you have political capital to spend and you also want to make a difference in the country and you think about big and little ways to do that. 

Sure. You know, as I say, I'm not a member of his staff and I'm not a politician, but I can tell you one story that I think goes to the heart of it. I remember when he was inaugurated as governor in 1987, I went down and I remember sitting next to his mother, who was this extraordinarily positive sort of joyous woman who just, I think, had one of the best attitudes toward life of anyone I'd ever met, who'd had great things happen to her and terrible things happen to her and always focused on the positive and went on. And the president -- governor then -- was giving a speech in the Arkansas legislature, talking about education reform that he was trying to bring about. And I remember him saying that he'd been at a retirement home and he thought of these people and he saw all these people and they said-- he said it occurred to him that when you got older, you didn't really think of everything that had happened in your life, you remembered the things which had happened when you were most alive. And I think what the president is trying, really, in his work and feels in his soul, is that at this moment, when he's most alive and has a chance to affect people for the good, he wants to do that most positively through all of his initiatives. It's just a view of human nature and-- 

Talk about you. So he left to go back to Arkansas. 

That's true. 

And-- 

No, he left to be a Rhodes scholar. 

After Oxford-- went to Oxford and a Rhodes scholar and came back and-- 

Right. 

--he ran for Congress first and then ran for attorney general-- 

Right. 

--then ran for governor. 

Right. 

--and was elected governor and he lost and then he went on to-- 

Right. 

--be elected again and again and then he became elected to the presidency and we'll see what happens after he leaves the presidency. 

Sure. 

You, on the other hand, did what? 

I went to business school. 

Right. 

After business school, I did a very unorthodox thing. I left Harvard and I wrote a book, which I couldn't sell, a first novel. 

Right. 

Then I went back to work with my family in the business that they had in Maryland and-- jewelry and did that in the day and wrote a novel which I did sell and then wrote another novel and have now written this one. 

So-- 

So-- 

--primarily, what you do is-- 

Is write. 

--is write. 

Now. Only now what I do is to write, yeah. 

Yeah. This story-- it's the story of-- well, you tell me. 

It's the story of an American merchant banker who has married an Englishwoman and he moved into a different world. He was a person who also went to Harvard Business School, who had a view of life and wealth as liberating, as something which gave you the chance to-- money as something which gave you the chance to do what you want and who has married a beautiful and very glamorous woman who accidentally inherits her family's stately home. So he lives a very-- you know, in a very aristocratic milieu and one of a certain obvious wealth in England. He feels he's almost a reluctant expatriate. He feels torn between two cultures, she similarly. And I think he's coming to recognize the obligations that come with the kind of wealth she's inherited, where you're a custodian, a fiduciary-- 

And then what happens? 

--more than an owner. 

Then things begin to go from good to bad. 

Yes. That's right. Yeah. I mean, it's a story of a plot. 

Yeah. 

Jim Howells (sp? ) very nicely said it was like Henry James with a plot. So I mean, it's an American's view of England. But there's a story and the story involves a merchant banking scandal in the city of London and-- 

He's falsely accused of being implicated. 

False accusations threatening the marriage-- 

Yeah. 

--threatening two adorable, I hope, twins. 

Yeah. 

And-- 

And his wife loses faith, huh? 

I won't tell you how it comes out. As you probably know already, but I won't tell those listening. But yes, there's a great strain on the marriage and she does lose faith. And the differences in their background become manifest in the story. 

Is Henry James the novelist that's influenced you the most? 

No, I would say-- oh, wait. I'm not sure there is one, but probably in that group of people I like so much, who influenced me when I was young, Scott Fitzgerald, John Cheever. I love John O'Hara, who seems to me unfairly forgotten today. And I love-- I love the eloquence of William Trevor, who writes today so beautifully, I think. 

Would you write non-fiction? 

Haven't thought of it, but I might after-- I've just done another book, which I've got to polish off, but-- 

Another novel. 

After Grace and Favor, another novel. 

Yeah. What kind of setting? 

America. 

America? 

America in one or two years-- (crosstalk) 

--intertwining of money and politics and power? 

Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. I mean-- 

How about a novel about your best friend becoming president? 

No. (unintelligible) 

Grace and Favor-- George Plimpton says, ''A family saga reminiscent of Henry James at his best.'' I hadn't seen that. ''A masterpiece,'' Plimpton says. Thomas Caplan-- Robert Stone says, ''A wry, sly look at transatlantic mores through the eyes of a shrewd, observant mid-Atlantic man.'' Chris Buckley-- ''They don't write them like this anymore. Grace and Favor is like a Battersea box: pretty highly polished inside and out with surprises inside.'' And it goes on and on. So-- 

That's very kind. 

--Thomas Caplan, Grace and Favor. Thank you for coming. 

Thank you, Charlie, very much, for having me.
