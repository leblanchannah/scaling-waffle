The Armenian Genocide, which occurred from 1915 until 1923, claimed the lives of over 1.5 million people. While many countries have recognized the event, others, including the United States and Turkey, have not. A new film from Director Terry George is one of the first feature films to depict the genocide. Here is the trailer for "The Promise." 

Be careful. Thank you. (MUSIC) Shoot him! (EXPLOSION) (MUSIC) The world is at your feet, Mikael, do us proud. 

You're going to become a doctor? 

Yes, it's my passion. (MUSIC) 

Christopher Myers. 

Chris is the star reporter for the "Associated Press." A toast...to old friends and new. Bravo! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Ana is a fine woman, Mikael. 

You make me feel like I'm home. 

She's very fond of you, it's obvious. (CHANTING) 

It's very dangerous for Armenians right now. I want to get you out of here. 

If it's not safe for me then it's not safe for any of my people. (MUSIC) 

What is the "Associated Press" doing here? 

Reporting on the war. 

There's no war here. (MUSIC) 

No one here is safe. (MUSIC) I have to get us out of here before there is no time left. 

I was told that you organized an escape route. How can I help? (MUSIC) 

Ana! (MUSIC) 

Do you love him? (MUSIC) Mikael, run! (MUSIC) 

You trust no one. (MUSIC) 

Chris? (MUSIC) 

We will build a future together. (MUSIC) 

Joining me now is the film's writer and director, Terry George, as well as three of its stars, Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Angela Sarafyan. I am pleased to have all of them here at this table. Terry, let me begin with you because this is a historical incident. Tell us what happened and why there is so much controversy, you know, and why there has not been a film. 

Well, the background to the genocide itself is that when the first world war broke out, the Turkish government at that time, actually the Ottoman Empire government, there was no Turkey, they made a decision to basically to eliminate the Armenian population. And they used the cover of the war between the Turks and the Russians in the northern border to say that the Armenians had risen up and that they had to be moved out of that war zone. What in fact happened was the bulk of the population, from Iran, the Ottoman Empire were basically herded into the desert and walked to death or massacred in rivers, fields, cliffs, drowned at sea. And so this was -- it wasn't the first genocide of the 20th century, but a key moment in these catastrophes in that the word itself, genocide, came from this event. 

Why has the United States refused to clearly call it a genocide? 

Well, the fact that it hasn't been covered by film and the reason why the United States hasn't called it a genocide are merged together, in that, Turkey has enormous influence, strategic influence, both during the cold war and now, and the Turkish government set about denying the event and suppressing the event itself in terms of filmmaking and reporting. And in fact, twice attempts were made to make a film about a particular siege, "40 days of Musa Dagh," and the Turkish government leaned on both the State Department and the studios and had it squashed. So it's been one of the great unknown catastrophes of the 20th century. 

And still being fought over. 

Yes, it's still -- President Obama before he was elected, promised to recognize the genocide and then, reneged on that promise. 

Did he go so far as to say he will study it or something like that? 

Well, his last comment was my opinion of the event hasn't changed. But the G-word could not be spoken. And Ambassador Samantha Power, who is a friend, was unable to utter G-word either, even though she had written a book called "The Problem From Hell" and won a Pulitzer prize, highlighting the Armenian Genocide as the beginning of the American government's reaction to these events. So it is a very emotive topic and now with President Erdogan and the position he has taken. 

The authority that he has as president. 

Increased this week, indeed, and I don't see a change in Turkey's attitude to it or even President Trump's attitude. 

Angela, this is also a love story too. 

Yes, yes. 

I mean, tell me about that. 

Well -- 

Because it involved both of your costars. 

Well, I play Maral, who is a traditional Armenian woman in a small village where Mikael, Oscar Isaac's character, comes from. And I believe that there are two different kinds of loves in this love story. And in the one here, I believe Maral is very much in love with Mikael, but in the case of Mikael, he marries her for practical reasons. And well, is betrothed to her for practical reasons and goes off to become a medical student to pursue his dreams, to bring back that knowledge to the small village where they live. And so I was lucky enough to play this Armenian traditional woman, being Armenian myself, both my mother and my grandmother, fine examples of what that is. And this film, this story was very, very personal for me because I have heard the stories from my ancestors brought down to my grandparents who then told us about how they survived. And so it was very special to be a part of the film. 

Who is your character, Christian? 

I play a character called Chris Myers who is a member of the "Associated Press" and so, he's there to cover the events. He is there actually more led by his love for a different Armenian character in the film who wants to return to her roots. He's a more kind of dissolute character, very acerbic, quite arrogant and proud, but irritatingly correct about a number of things. And finds himself ceasing to be an observer and starting to be a participant in the events of the story. 

Because of what is happening. 

Because he sees it up close. Because he sees these massacres that, like Angela is talking about, you know, sees the immediate impact of it, the brutality of it. That the information is being suppressed. It was illegal to take photo documentation and get that out of the country. Most of it that exists is actually by German soldier called Armin Wegner. And he just has a change in spirit. There are two lines in the film, one is by Mikael, Oscar's character, where he says to my character, it must be so nice, so convenient to be able to come and visit and witness people's pain and report on it and then return to the comfort of your own home, it's a very valid point. And then Chris's response is, yes, but without the press, nobody would know anything about the Armenian Genocide. 

But does he then have deeper involvement? 

He does, yes, yes, he actually becomes involved and participates in trying to save these people on the Armenians on Musa Dagh. 

Oscar has been here a number of times before. What do you hope people take away from this film? 

Well, I hope people recognize not only the atrocity of what happened and that it helps shed light on that, but also that they make the parallels to what is happening today in the same parts of the world -- the same types of attack in this country on the press and on the idea of refugees -- that there is compassion, that it elicits empathy. Particularly with this story, you know, as the years go by, it becomes quite abstract, the number, 1.5 million Armenians killed. It is easy to kind of see it as a statistic. Hopefully the movie helps humanize these events and gets closer to eliciting that empathy and to be able to see this is the same thing that's going on now. I remember we were shooting scenes of us jumping in the water to save orphans that were fleeing as refugees from Syria, from the desert, at the same time that reports were happening of all of these refugees drowning in the water, about this man trying to save his family that all drowned. So it was very impactful to know that that same thing was happening again. Also, the fact that people can go and know that 100 percent of the proceeds of the film will go to charity, to humanitarian charities. I think that is unprecedented. 

I've never heard of that before. 

I haven't either. 

It goes to the Enough Project, Century run by John Prendergast, to Amnesty International, to Human Rights Watch, all charities involved with holding people accountable for genocidal activity, for human right abuses, and for refugee crises. 

Was John in any way involved in this? 

No, no, he wasn't. But with a number of consultants and supporters, and now he's active in helping us promote the "Keep The Promise" drive which is to aid these people, so yeah -- 

This is a story that families pass on from generation to generation. 

Yes. Just like my family did, there are several stories. It's interesting. If you see the film, the orphans in the movie are really my great, great grandparents that survived. And the funny throughline that kind of brings everything full circle is my great, great grandparents left, I guess, I would call old Armenia because they were old villages that were destroyed with old monuments of churches that now Kurds live in. Basically they're the very things that have existed before Christ or during Christ and now they're the walls of homes of other people. And they left old Armenia and went to Syria to Aleppo for refuge and today people from Syria leave and go to other countries for that same thing. They could go to Spain or other places. And it just seems so pertinent for that reason, that a hundred years later, the same thing seems to unfortunately happen. 

How much did you know, Christian, about? 

I knew almost nothing, it's embarrassing to say, but I knew almost nothing. And it's stunning. What I found is that many people know almost nothing. It is like the great unknown genocide. That is just horrendous, 1.5 million people died, and I didn't know anything about that. And you have to think that the lack of consequences to this genocide may well have provoked the other genocides that we've had to witness in the century since. 

Right. 

It is that infamous statement by Adolf Hitler when he was marshaling his generals to go into Poland and ordering them to show no mercy. He said, "Who, after all, remembers the Armenians? And that was reported by Admiral Canaris who subsequently was executed for trying to assassinate Hitler. So the lack of knowledge about the Armenian Genocide became a rallying call by Hitler to his generals. 

And it's also just been started, it's The Promise Foundation for Human Rights at UCLA, isn't it? Which sole point is to educate people about genocide, not just Armenian, but all genocides and human rights abuses and to be a resource of education. And Terry, very much, you wanted this film to be seen by young people and educate them. 

Like "Hotel Rwanda," I was determined it would be PG-13. Because ultimately, it is a love story where we take the audience through these events and I want it to be accessible to teenagers and also to people who might feel that an R-rated film about a genocide is something that beyond which they want to see. The horror in it is psychological and suggested as much by our great actors as anything on the screen. 

What do you mean by, how is it psychological? 

Well, when you -- when Oscar's character in particular encounters the aftermath of a slaughter, I play the horror on his face and on his reaction rather than show any of the goriness. And the suggestion all the time is, it's always better, I feel, that the audience imagines what took place beforehand than to attempt to re-create an event that you can't possibly show the true horror of it on screen. 

What is the definition of a genocide? 

It's an attempt by a group, a government or a group to exterminate either a nation, a tribe, a religious sect, or organization. And a systematic attempt by that -- 

How many have there been in the last -- 

The ones I know, that there was one in the movie committed by the Germans, which was the first genocide of the 20th century. There were the Armenians. The holocaust, of course. The slaughter of Ukrainians during Stalin's war. Cambodia, -- Rwanda, and currently Guatemala, Amal Clooney and Jeffrey Roberts are prosecuting or pushing the situation of the Yazidi. 

Right. Christians in Irag. 

In Irag, in northern Iraq, particularly the Yazidis that will be recognized as a genocide -- 

Are they Christians or are they -- 

Yazidi is a separate sect, but the Christians were also persecuted. But that particular incident of the Yazidi being trapped in Mount Sinjar and the systemic slaughter by ISIS, Amal Clooney and the organization around her want that recognized so that -- and the purpose of this is beyond just recognition. It is to identify the perpetrators and have them pursued in the same way that Milosevic and Mladic, so forth, were prosecuted for genocide. 

It's a legal term now. 

Oh, it is, yeah. Actually the word was established by a lawyer, Rafael Lemkin, to describe what happened to the Armenians and subsequently what happened to, in the holocaust. So the whole denial, the very word that was concocted is denied by the Turks which is kind of ironic. 

This denial, right, don't you think that is -- it is a bit like the debate about climate change here in the U.S., you know. People do a smokescreen to pretend there is a debate, the facts are in, there is a climate change, and I feel it's a similar case with the Armenian Genocide. 

Lots of people make that argument, especially now, Al Gore among others make that point. But this is your kind of story. 

Well, my kind of story is when ordinary people with their ordinary -- with their weaknesses are confronted by monumental events and catastrophe and find the inner strength to survive and carry others with them and triumph over evil. That is what I always look for, whether it is Gerry Conlon in "In the Name of the Father", or Paul Rusesabagina in "Hotel Rwanda", or Mikael and Ana and Chris in this. I like the notion of ordinary people confronting these events and finding their inner strength. And that's -- for me, that's the greatest form of storytelling to get a message out. 

Did you choose this role because you are being offered many, I would assume, because of the story, because the script, because of the other actors, because what? 

Yes, there was a lot of reasons. But I think really it's that scene that he mentioned about coming upon a whole village, his family, his betrothed, everyone slaughtered by the side of the river. I couldn't read that without getting quite emotional about it. Every time I tried to consider other things or -- that was undeniable, that scene. So I think above everything else it was that scene that made me say, I want to understand this or at least shed some light on this or try to experience a little bit of that. 

Thank you for coming, great to see you, thank you. Christian, it's always good to see you, thank you. Thank you, Terry. Much success. The film is called "The Promise." It opens in theaters on Friday, April 21st. That's Friday, April 21st. Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
