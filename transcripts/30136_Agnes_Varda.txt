I'm Molly Haskell, author of the book Steven Spielberg: A Life in Films, filling in for Charlie Rose. Agnes Varda is here. She is a filmmaker, documentarian, photographer, and visual artist. Her work in the 1950s and '60s helped pioneer the French New Wave film movement. She's in New York for an art exhibition at the Blum &amp; Poe Gallery on East 66th Street. "Agnes Varda: Life As Art," a special event presented by Rendezvous with French Cinema will take place on Friday, March 10th, at the Film Society at Lincoln Center in honor of Varda's work. I am pleased to have Agnes Varda at this table for the first time. Welcome, Agnes. 

Hello, Molly. 

It is so great to see you. We go back a very long way. You told me ahead of time not to say how long so I won't. Your show is incredible. The first room I went into has a huge photograph of the ocean. Then there is a film of the ocean rip -- of the waves rippling and there's a sound track, and there's something, I guess it's canvass, it's almost like sand. You're absolutely -- it's a transporting moment. 

It is real sand. 

It is real sand, yes. 

I wanted a representation of the seaside and something reality that you know is there. 

You always combine -- you somehow manage to combine -- I mean, this goes back a long way, but the documentary and the imaginary in one. 

Yes. 

It is the most -- I mean, people assume that nobody wanted to leave. It needs a bigger room because people are just absolutely fixated. 

Because it's based on contemplation. 

Calm. 

And calm, and, you know, we're in a world moving so much. 

Yes. 

And films and everything is so much action that I propose the peaceful total look, contemplating something that we all know and all love in a way, the seaside. And it's not tempest -- 

No, it's a quiet ocean, isn't it? Is the soundtrack actually from that particular ocean or is it-- 

It's mental. We all know what is the feeling being near the sea when it's calm. 

Yes. 

And we hear the... It's something that everybody can feel wherever they have seen it or felt it. So, the piece is called "Seaside" and I'm impressed because people sit and they stay. 

They can't leave it. 

That's nice. 

It's absolutely mesmerizing. And in the next room, you have something that reminded me a little bit of Chris Marker who was one of your colleagues in the early days of film making. The picture, a 1955 photograph, and then you've recreated it as a drama alongside. 

I've always been interested in images. The frame of image. What is on the right, but also what is an image, if you -- is it snapshot -- you come, you see people. 

And family. 

Maybe people you never met that you see somewhere. And I always questioned who are they? How did they happen to be together at the same place? Do they know each other? Did they know each other? And so I made a kind of screenplay that could be possible about these unknown people, where character is fiction. 

That's wonderful. 

It is just always using my imagination, but asking the people who look at the images to wake up their own imagination because each image is a mystery. Even things that we know what it is. 

And you use local actors and gave them a script? 

Oh, no, no. It's people, I like them to come into my art project. 

Just ordinary people. 

Oh, my neighbor. 

Yes. 

This one is the plumber of my village. 

The plumber, yes. 

And his mother and another woman who is a teacher. But I will say, would you like to come into my dream becoming a film? And they say yes, and I told them what I felt. And they became what I was feeling. 

Yes. 

And I've done that very often. But this is not the documentary. When I do a documentary, I respect their own life, their own world, and that's what I have been doing recently. You know, I just finished a feature documentary with J.R., the artist J.R., and we did together a trip in France in some villages, some small villages, and we met people. And together, we asked them to speak about what they feel, what they see, and then we make sometimes big images of them and I make them, they have worth and (speaking French). 

The value, the worth? 

Value, their worth, them be the star but the star has no meaning. 

This is like the Gleaners one, that was the first one where you scavenged, sort of scavenger, discovery of cast-off things, right, things that nobody pays attention to? 

Nobody listens to the gleaners. The same I did the work on "The Widows." Nobody listened to the widows, supposedly boring. And now, when I did that thing, we were in villages where people were working or a girl was serving in a bar and people working in a factory where there was a lot of danger, we asked these people to be with us, and we built some strange things. In the harbor, we used the container to make a Lego construction. 

Yes. 

You know, we tell them we want to be artists with them and they help us. 

They collaborate. 

Yes to collaborate, they help, they get involved. They like to feel that they have the right to be artists with us. 

Yes. 

Because it not --- I'm not untouchable, you know. 

You've always had this decentralized sense of film, as belonging, something that's not just something handed down and imposed on people but they bring to you. Even in something like "Vagabond," that wonderful film you made. 

That's a fiction. 

I know it's a feature film, but even so, the idea of different people, it's a young girl played by Sandrine Bonnaire, who's found dead, and you have different people giving their perspective on that. 

Real people. 

Real people, yes. 

But you see in the installation that I'm showing at Blum &amp; Poe right now, I'm very excited because some of these people have been reenacting a still photo. They were people I met again. No actors at all. I say, look at that image. We try to imitate it. We bought a dress to the woman acting looking like the dress in the picture. We will act, we will play, we are doing that picture, and they play the game with us. 

Everybody because it's like family photographs on vacation, it's something everybody's taken and they look back at them and they wonder and try to remember what was going on before and after, why is he holding the baby now. 

Yes, but in families, they know each other, I'd like to have unknown people together and say -- 

They weren't a family at all. 

Well, no. Does it make history, could we believe that something happened between this one and this one. 

Yes. 

So, I think I have my imagination, not I wouldn't say working, but alive all the time. 

Well, I think even if something like "Les Creatures," where a guy is a writer and it's a little bit the same thing, where the people in the village become imaginary people. You have the this sense of no boundaries between the real and the imaginary. 

You know, reality is so difficult. 

Yes. 

It's so tough. The whole world is an incredible difficult reality. So, if we can reinvent reality, make it more sensible, more near us, so it makes sense that we share with them something, stories or emotion or spectacle, something, not only entertainment but having fun together. 

Because you realize, especially with the politics now, a lot of people feel left out. They feel they're people at the artistic center of the world and these other people who are just nobodies. And you somehow give them the feeling they aren't nobodies, and you've always known that. 

In the center of French cinema, which is very strong and has become sort of more known at the time like New Wave, but now we have a lot of new directors and women directors, a lot of them came here with the French cinema today, event. 

I met you when you came. I was 65, and I just started at the French film office, and it was "Le Bonheur," but before that, you made "Cleo from 5 to 7," the story of a pop singer who is waiting for a diagnosis that she may have cancer, and it was really a kind of feminist film (speaking French) because, you know, so many French films are women walking, beautiful male directors, and these beautiful kind of woman, girls on the cusp of womanhood and they're there for the pleasure of the male who is looking. 

No, you make it too much. 

No, I think that French cinema has a lot of those, kind of women walking and -- 

No, some men when will make film in which they try to understand what is the essence of a woman. 

But yours is a woman whose mind you're interested in and sensibilities. 

I was trying to find this radical way of doing cinema -- more than telling that story and another one, trying to make the cinema, like other art moved, you know, painting had moved, literature had moved, and cinema was still telling stories like coming from a book or from a place. 

You use the phrase, cine-writing. 

Yes because I want to cinema -- or from the inspiration that is there in real life, and then, from real life, inventing a shape of touching people. I like to -- I don't want them to cry, to scream, to be afraid. I'm against a film in which -- 

Melodrama, yes. 

-- the killer, is he behind the door? Okay, very good films are made like this, a lot of beautiful films, but I like to work on something which is sensible in which maybe the people watching the film get to feel what is presented, what is proposed. So I have been doing the life of a photographer, then the life of a filmmaker, then I switch from an old filmmaker to a young visual artist. Then in the last ten years, I have been doing mostly installations, exhibitions, using all photographs, mixing them with video, trying to reconciliate, you know, (inaudible) and digital -- 

It's wonderful, "The Beaches of Agnes," you go back, and you're not even a beach person, and yet, you have these wonderful installations and movies about beaches, but you find a picture of two young boys and then you find that they're now old men and you bring them to that, I think, I mean, that's -- 

When we met, Molly, we were young persons. (LAUGHTER) This was a long time ago. 

It was. 

And what we still share is love for movies, love for experimentation, adventure, because trying to invent cinema, and you do a work by reading, understanding, sharing what you know and what you understood about cinema, sharing it with people who go to movies, that's what you were. 

And I knew Jacques, your husband, and you knew my husband, Andrew, my film critic husband, and so we both had marriages in which love and movies were intertwined. And so I think we had a tremendous rapport on that level and you made the wonderful movie about Jacques and his dying -- one thing I want -- have you seen and have you heard about "La La Land?" 

Oh, my God. 

Because it is very much a tribute, in many ways a tribute to Demy. 

I must say that Damien Chazelle -- 

Chazelle, the director. 

When he speaks about the film, he pays tribute to Jacques Demy himself. 

He does, yes. 

In France, he came and said, when he saw "Umbrellas of Cherbourg," was 17 and it changed his life. He decided to become a filmmaker. 

Yes. 

And you know what we did when he came to Paris, he invited us and said, can I come at your place? And being in the courtyard where I had been living with Jacques, he felt so touched, I mean, like a kid, you know, I said, okay, you've done a film, come on, don't be so -- He said because Jacques Demy has been so important in my life, so you understand that listening to this makes my heart beat. 

Incredible. 

I said what a nice boy. 

The effect that you and your fellow New Wave directors had in the '60s and early '70s on American film making is just indescribable and you must know that. I remember when you came over with "Le Bonheur" and Mike Nichols came. Do you remember the screening and I was there? I was interpreting and your English wasn't as great as it is now. And Mike Nichols was there and he was so moved by it. Do you remember that? You were part of the Left Bank group, right? That distinction that was you, Alain Resnais, and Chris Marker, the sort of intellectuals, and Jacques Demy. 

We were on the left side of politics also. 

On the left politics. 

And we lived on the left side of the river, which was very strange. 

It is strange when you think about it and then Godard, Truffaut, and Chabrol were considered the Right Bank, they were movie maniacs, and they were the ones that sort of came up on Americans and very influenced by Americans, although Resnais also. 

It has been a time of very, very incredible -- 

Creativity. 

Like spring, like flowers open -- 

You kept going, this is what I can't get. I mean, it's almost like you've had ten careers. You've kept going with the same curiosity and creativity now for all these years and just going in whatever direction drew you. 

I am lucky to have kept that, to use it, that desire to experiment something, and at this exhibition that I show at Blum &amp; Poe, I never had the experience to put the seaside on the 5th floor. 

Yes. 

And so people forget they're in New York, forget they have to go to the 5th floor -- 

That's right. You go up in a tiny elevator and you go into this little room and suddenly the room just opens up. 

And that's what we need. I'm here in an exhibition that makes me very happy because I see people coming, people who love films, people who love art, and the young people. 

They were all young people yesterday. What is gonna happen with the "Rendezvous?" What happens on March 10th? What is that? 

Oh, they asked me to -- I don't remember the date but they do. 

Yes. 

They ask me -- I will present (speaking French). 

(speaking French), yes. 

Then I will present (speaking French). 

(speaking French). 

Yes, and then I will speak with Melissa Anderson about my work. Because I come to New York, they grab me and say you have to do this and this and this. Next time, I won't tell nobody, I won't say that I come. 

Don't tell anybody. 

Because now I'm on program. 

Program, well. 

About a program was a delight for me to see you again. 

It's so great. You're just an inspiration. I was sort of flagging and I went to the show and I thought, my God, if she can do it, I got to do something. I mean, it was just wonderful. 

Are you about to become also a visual artist? 

I don't think so, but I'm soaking up yours, and I can't wait to see what you do next. 

I feel happy that it happens -- as I said yesterday, it's the last part of my life. 

Yes. 

And so much good -- so many good things happened to me. I work, I do a lot, but there is an answer to that. There is an answer from the people coming to see. 

The content and also the people that you're making films with, you're sort of collaborators, I mean the energy that comes back and forth between you and them, it's a glorious thing. 

If the energy can be shared and the emotion and sometimes the jokes and spirit, I think we -- 

And humor, too. I think people don't talk as much as about your humor. Even in the photographs, I noticed in the show, there's a kind of sly humor in them. And you're a very funny person. 

Well, I'm glad you've got what I'm trying to propose and it works sometimes. 

Well, congratulations. 

Thank you, Molly. It was beautiful to see you. 

You too.
