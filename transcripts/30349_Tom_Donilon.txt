We begin with the Chinese-American summit in Florida. Chinese president Xi Jinping arrived there earlier today for a highly anticipated meeting with President Trump. It is the first bilateral meeting between the two leaders and it is seen as an important step in improving U.S.-China relations. Trump is expected to press his Chinese counterpart on tense issues such as trade deficits and North Korea. Meanwhile, President Xi is seeking assurances that Washington will adhere to the One China policy. Joining me now to talk about the summit is Tom Donilon. He served as National Security Advisor in the Obama administration and has met the president of China a number of times. I'm pleased to have him back on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. Good to be with you. 

Because as National Security Advisor, you made China particularly an area of interest for yourself, what do you think the Chinese are coming here expecting? What do they hope to accomplish? 

Well, you know, for both sides, it's a very important meeting. It's clearly the most important diplomatic meeting that President Trump will have had so far in his presidency, by far. I think on the Chinese side, I think that their approach would be to have a successful meeting. I think they put a high premium on having a successful meeting and, indeed, particularly successful moving forward between now and the end of this year, the fall of this year when the Chinese leadership changes takes place. In October and November of this year, you'll have changes in the politburo and the politburo standing committee and, essentially, the leadership for the next five years of President Xi's tenure. So, Charlie, to be direct I think that he'll want to have a successful meeting. He'll want to show himself being able to operate effectively on the international stage, and I think he'll try to get this on a path where he doesn't have any sort of conflict or crisis between now and the time that he has to engage in his own leadership selections at the end of the year. 

So he's looking forward -- he's looking ahead to October and the very important Congress that takes place, October, November. 

Right. I think that's exactly right. Or again, he'll pick the -- he'll select the leadership for the next five years. And of course what does he really want to avoid, he'll certainly want to avoid any sort of sharp trade conflict between now and then. Trying to -- his keeping the Chinese economy on track to meet its growth and other goals between now and then is very important. And, of course, the one thing that could take China off track is the conflict with the United States. I think he'll seek to try to put in place a process that will avoid any conflict at least in the short and medium term. 

What do you think the Chinese think of President Trump? 

Well, I think that -- one of the things that is going to happen in this summit is I think they're coming here to take his measure, as with President Trump of President Xi. You know, the summit is taking place very early in the Trump administration, number one. Number two, it is taking place before the Trump administration has really outlined, in any public or definitive way, their policy towards Asia and China. We haven't really seen that. It's one of the interesting things about the Trump administration we can talk about. So there's not really a strategy or policy perspective laid out. Number three, I think it's pretty clear that the Trump administration is still developing those approaches particularly on trade and perhaps North Korea. 

Number four, five, the Trump administration has not yet filled out crucial positions at the State Department and other places. 

Exactly right. You really don't have in place, except for a couple of people, people with any real Asia or China experience on the Trump administration team right now. And you do have, you have really the administration which has been very slow in filling out its personnel. So given those circumstances you're coming in here without a real kind of precise set of goals. So what do you do in that setting? I think that they'll look to establish a personal rapport between the two presidents. I think that the two presidents will be able to take the time over 24, 25 hours here to take the measure of each other and you lay out your agenda. It would be, I think, most useful, but I don't know that we're ready to do this at this point, to lay out a general strategic approach to Asia and China. I think it's more likely that you'll see kind of the goal of having a personal rapport, taking measure of each other, and laying out an agenda, and then a process for how they'll push through addressing the particular issues that each side brings up. 

At the top is obviously trade and because the president has been talking about that for a long time. Secondly, and getting more difficult every day is North Korea. 

Yes. No doubt, Charlie. I think with respect to trade, obviously, coming out of the campaign, President Trump will put a high priority on addressing trade issues. And you know it's interesting, coming into his administration he was very hard on a number of issues, right? He put into question the One China policy. Secretary Tillerson made a number of statements about blockading the South China Sea islands. They threatened to name China a currency manipulator on day one of the administration, threatened 45 percent tariffs. It's been a much more of an accommodating stance at this point I think. And they're backing off from some of those harsher positions that came out of the campaign. But trade is still front and center. And there are real issues on trade here between the United States and China. There is a large trade deficit between China and the United States, but the real focus I think should be on access for investment in U.S. companies and the treatment of U.S. companies. But you make the point on the security side, the most important security challenge in Asia right now is North Korea. And that has to be front -- that has to be front and center for President Xi and President Trump. We need to have, I think, an intensified focus and approach. Secretary Tillerson in Asia, recently, as you know, Charlie, said that the approaches of the last couple of administrations have failed to achieve our national goals. That's true. Almost across every dimension the direction in terms of the North Korean nuclear program are going in a negative direction. All the indicators at this point are negative with respect to the development of weapons, the development of the means to deliver them. So that's got to be a high priority. I don't know that you'll come out of this session with an agreement on how to approach it. We can talk about what the elements of that might be. But you're exactly right, this has to be front and center. This really is a national security crisis for the United States coming at us like a freight train. 

In fact, it is said that President Obama told President-elect Trump it is the most pressing and difficult issue/challenge for him as he assumes the presidency. Let me just start with China. Why have they been, in the past, unwilling to take the kinds of moves that the United States, and I assume other Asian neighbors, wanted them to take. 

Yes, I think it's because for a number of things. Number one, Charlie, there is a historic relationship between China and North Korea. Now that relationship has been frayed of late. I think it's probably in the worst shape it's been in in many, many decades, probably. President Xi has not received Kim Jung-un, the ruler in North Korea. And there have been a lot of tensions that are developing between the two countries. So the relationship is not, is not in good shape, number one. Number two -- but they have a history -- Number two is a deep Chinese concern about stability on the Korean peninsula. And not undertaking a set of steps which might result in some sort of precipitous collapse or a destabilizing of the situation. And third, they still, to some extent, regard North Korea as a buffer, as an allied buffer. I think though that the challenge is coming into focus here, which is that the United States is going to have to take a number of steps here to address the North Korea nuclear challenge. And the challenge, by the way, Charlie, I think is becoming more complex for this reason. If, in fact -- there have been reports and as evidenced by the number, they had five nuclear tests and they may be proceeding towards a sixth if the press reports are correct -- if you have a country that is moving towards having larger numbers, increasing numbers of nuclear weapons, it presents a much more complicated problem for a number of reasons. Number one, it is obviously a threat to the region and potentially the U.S. homeland. Number two, it becomes a much more difficult set of targets, the more weapons they have. But number three, they also become a proliferation threat. You know, it's a matter of just analysis. If a country gets passed the number of weapons it needs to protect itself and engage in deterrent, a country -- a regime like this becomes a real threat in terms of proliferation. And they've shown the willingness to proliferate in the past. 

OK, here's what I don't understand, and you should know the answer to this. Do they understand the severity of the issue of North Korea having nuclear weapons that they can deliver to South Korea or to the United States, wherever they might want to do that, wherever they might want to target? Do the Chinese accept the severity of that and why it is so unacceptable to the United States? 

Well, number one, they don't think they would be the target. Number two, you know, we have worked hard in dialogue with the Chinese to come to an assessment, kind of a joint assessment as to what the threat is and what the North Korean tensions might be. But this is the dialogue, right. This is the conversation between the United States and China. I think some progress has been made on it, but we're not there on it with respect to, I think, just how severe and what kind of time frame this is on. That's got to be the conversation. It is an urgent problem. And the Chinese I think can't view it uni-dimensionally. It can't be viewed just as a stability problem anymore for them in the region, it has to be viewed multi-dimensionally which is that the United States cannot tolerate North Korea moving towards a situation where it has multiple weapons that can be miniaturized and that can be put on top of delivery systems that can reach the United States or other United States interests. And, given that, that the United States is going to have to take a number of steps which are going to be strategically uncomfortable for China, but don't have anything to do with China. And this is really where the test and the relationship is going to be. 

Do you think the Chinese take seriously the president's statement that if, in fact, the Chinese do not help the United States may have to go alone? 

Well, I think it's a statement of fact, right, that the president of the United States has an obligation first and foremost to protect the United States from threats. And if over the course of the next period of time, we don't get the kind of cooperation and kind of the joint effort we need with China to address a North Korea program, I think any president would have to, would make a similar statement that in fact the United States will take whatever steps it has to take to protect itself. Now, the alternative to that, of course, is trying to develop a joint approach with the Chinese, and there are a number of things, I think, we can do, including dramatically increasing the economic pressure on North Korea. My own judgement is that we should move to an Iran-style set of sanctions on North Korea, which would be -- as they were, and I oversaw, as you know, the Iranian sanctions effort for a number of years for the United States -- to move the sanctions to a level and a pressure that are regime threatening. And there're a number of steps I think that we can take. We have to continue I think to build out our defenses in the region which is giving China, obviously, a lot of discomfort, particularly with respect to what we have to do I think in South Korea. And we should begin a dialogue or try to have a dialogue with China about what the future of the peninsula looks like. 

In a summit like this, will human rights be at all discussed? 

That's up to -- I don't think the Chinese will raise it. I think it's up to the president of the United States to raise it. 

So that's my question. I mean, do you expect the president of United States will raise the issue of human rights or is he so intent on finding some kind of way out of North Korea, and trade, and perhaps some other important issues, that human rights doesn't get to the table? 

Charlie, this has been an administration which has basically backed off raising human rights as best I can see in any context. And I think it's a mistake. And I don't -- I can't think of a context here where the Trump administration has put human rights in a, kind of in the mix in terms of strategic dialogues and conversations that we're having with nations around the world. So I don't have high hopes that the president should raise, is going to raise human rights issues here. And this is, you know, this is a vacuum, this is a leadership vacuum that is not one that we should be creating but I fear that we are. Then there are a couple of other things, of course, our backing off on the TPP, the TransPacific Partnership, which was the trade arrangements that the United States negotiated with 11 other countries in the region. On the first day of the Trump administration, we backed out, that was really a gift to the Chinese because the Chinese, as you know, are developing their own approaches to trade with regional partners in the region. Our backing out of our strong support for the Paris Accords on climate leave another area for the Chinese to step into and exercise leadership, and take themselves off the hook, if you will, for some of the obligations that they've made. So, we've taken a number of steps here. I think human rights is a good example, I think the trade is a good example, the trade agreements are a good example, I think climate is a good example where we've opened up the vacuum for others to step in. 

Do you know what the North Koreans want? 

Yes, I think the North Koreans want to get to a point where the world recognizes them as a nuclear weapon state and a nuclear power, nuclear weapons power. I think that's where the North Korean, what the North Korean goal is. 

And so, therefore -- so therefore what would it take to have them give up that goal? What combination of things -- one thing, obviously, is they want bipartisan negotiations with the United States. They want some kind of agreement that the United States will not attack them. They want, I assume, some kind of economic support. But is that even remotely possible if their goal is to be a nuclear state? 

Well, you have to -- I think that the first point is to put pressure on them now prior to the getting to the goal of having, of getting to having the means of delivering nuclear weapons via an intercontinental ballistic missile to the United States. And that's why the engagement I think now is important, the pressure campaign is now important. If you got into, then, a set of negotiations with the North Koreans, I certainly don't think anybody in the United States would support the United States acknowledging them as a nuclear weapons state. But there is a whole range of things in a discussion, if we can get to the table, and a discussion about the various kind of arrangements on the peninsula, and the future of the peninsula, including taking into account North Korea's supposed security needs. 

Can we trust them? Or is this a trust but verify circumstance? 

No, you can't trust the North Koreans. We actually entered into -- this is an important point. We entered into, as you know, an agreed framework during the Clinton Administration which did freeze the nuclear weapons production facilities in North Korea for a number of years. We discovered at the beginning of the Bush administration that they were cheating on the deal. It was probably a better, it probably would have been a better approach then to keep in place the arrangements that we had, of freezing one part of the program and then addressing the areas where they were cheating as opposed to walking away from the entire deal, which is what we did. And the result has been, and we also entered into, early on in the Obama administration, a set of understandings with the North Koreans which they welched on. So, yes, you have to assume cheating, you have to assume they're going to continue to try to move towards their goals, which means that the pressure campaign working with the Chinese and others needs to be especially harsh. And, by the way, at the end of the day, I think we need to do a careful look at our other options. 

In meetings like this between the two most powerful people in the world, do they ever meet alone or is it always necessary to have advisors and note takers and other people there? 

Yes, unusual for -- and lots of relationships around the world, that the president and the leader of the other country will meet one-on-one, or maybe with just one other aide or a translator. That's unusual in the U.S.-Chinese context for lots of different reasons, including the system that the Chinese president represents. As you know, I negotiated the Sunnyland Summit in 2013 between President Xi and President Obama. And as part of that summit we did put in place a time for pure one-on-one conversation. And that did take place during the course. It's an unusual thing to take place. It's important. But it did take place in the Sunnyland Summit. And my understanding, Charlie, is that the Trump administration is trying to have some one-on-one time. It's never truly one-on-one because there has to be translators, but kind of the principals plus translators, I think, they're trying to arrange that today in Florida. And they're going to try to have, I think, an informal dinner tonight with the two presidents and their spouses tonight over dinner. So, yes, I think that it's not typical in the Chinese-U.S. setting, but it has been, since Sunnyland, it's happened a couple times and I think it's going to happen today. 

Did you suggest that the Chinese were seeking this? 

I think the Chinese had good reason to try and seek an early meeting with the United States here. With respect to the arrangements at least that I was involved in arranging, I think we were the party that sought to have smaller meetings and indeed the one-on-one session between President Obama and President Xi at Sunnyland, and they did it several times after that as well as part of the arrangement between the United States and China. 

What do you think the likely outcome of this summit will be? 

I don't know. I'm not obviously advising President Trump on this. I think the likely outcome will probably be they'll issue a positive statement. They're not going to have a press conference as I understand it, which I'm, you know, I don't know why they're not going to have a press conference. I don't think they're going to have a joint press conference. But the likely outcome will be a positive statement about the initial encounter between the two presidents. And a list of the issues that they discussed, and some sort of plan for how the United States and China are going to go about addressing these issues over a period of time with some deadlines. 

Tom, thank you for joining us. 

Charlie, nice talking with you, thank you for having me. 

Tom Donilon in Washington. Back in a moment, stay with us.
