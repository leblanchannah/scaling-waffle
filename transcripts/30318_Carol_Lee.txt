We continue our discussion of the relationship between Russia and the United States with Carol Lee of "The Wall Street Journal." Her article today looks at the prospects for rapprochement with Russia. She joins us now from Washington. Let me begin by this question. The headline says, "Trump cools on Russia rapport," what has he done to cool on that possibility? 

Well, he hasn't moved forward with the policy. The policy is still under a comprehensive review within the National Security Council, certain decisions haven't even made it to the president's desk. He has been frustrated with some moves that Russia has made, particularly a missile deployment that the administration believes violates the nuclear treaty. And they're frustrated with Russia's continued embrace of Iran. And, you know, one administration official told me that there are still attempts at cyber intrusions and that the president is frustrated by that. But also then the political atmosphere in Washington is making it very difficult for the president to try to move forward as quickly as everybody thought that he would with establishing warmer relations with Russia. Because if he were to go and try to establish some sort of grand bargain as he had hoped with Russia, then it would come under this new scrutiny because of the investigation that's clouding over his White House. 

When the president looks at -- he also, you've laid this out in this article, has declined an early meeting with Putin. 

That's right, and that is really aggravating the Russians. The government there is getting pretty frustrated. So the feeling is becoming mutual. They're really frustrated watching not just the president take meetings with foreign leader after foreign leader. Let's remember back in the campaign, Donald Trump had very few kind words for any world leader. He did, in fact, praise Vladimir Putin on a number of occasions, while also disparaging leaders like Angela Merkel, and China, and NATO. And so, he'll have met with a number of foreign leaders including Angela Merkel. He's hosting president of China, Xi Jinping, next week at his Mar-a-Lago estate. That really irritated the Russians. And meanwhile, there's no meeting on the books yet for Putin. And Moscow had asked the administration for one in May when the president's is going to be in Europe for a NATO summit, and the White House declined. And so, they're saying it looks more likely if one happens, it will happen closer to a gathering of the G20 leaders in July, which is in Germany. So there is growing frustration there, and that's just the meetings piece of it. And then you see, Vladimir Putin has looked at a number of different policy moves that this administration has made and that are not necessarily as much in his favor as he thought that they would be. 

I mean, so you have on the one hand Vladimir Putin, even as much as recently as this week, saying, we obviously had nothing to do with the things that are being alleged. At the same time, we read reports also of Vladimir Putin being disappointed with some aspects of the Trump administration and not being as enthusiastic for rapprochement as he might have been earlier. But as you -- go ahead. 

Right, well, and some of the examples are if you look at this is a White House that said it will maintain sanctions on Ukraine until Russia abides by the Peace Accord that the two sides had agreed to. That's not a position that Russia likes. The administration is backing Montenegro's ascension into NATO. That is not a position that Russia likes. And early on, when the U.N. ambassador, the president's ambassador to the U.N., had some really tough rhetoric for Russia, so it just has not been what President Putin thought it would be. 

What the president has done, President Trump, as I understand, I'm asking this as a question, has basically said yes, I've now recognized that the Russians made an effort to interfere in our election, but also other countries did as well, or something to that extent. What is the most damaging thing or what is the most clear example of where President Trump has reflected his understanding of what the Russians did or attempted to do? 

In terms of the cyberattacks? 

Yes. 

He -- he has, you know, when I was talking to people and writing this story, there is a recognition internally that Russia, not only did they have involvement in the election, but also that they continue to do things that obviously are classified. And so, you know, the public doesn't see but the president certainly sees them. And that has given the president pause as well. 

What was his hope during the campaign when he refused to criticize Russia for the relationship. Clearly he thought about the Russian might cooperate in antiterrorism measures. 

Yes, and he would still -- the White House would still like to find ways to cooperate on counterterrorism. I think the hope was, this is a president who likes to do big things and certainly likes to do things that people before him were incapable of doing. And his predecessors have really struggled with maintaining a positive relationship with Russia. And so it was kind of a challenge to him. This is just setting aside all of the issues that Russia and the Russia issue brings to him just because of these investigations. But I think he was hoping to do some large bargain where you could take all the different areas of tension and try to relieve them by cutting deals on other areas where they can agree. For instance, and the White House is still considering this even though they are not considering some sort of grand sweeping bargain with Russia, they are considering looking at sanctions that the Obama administration imposed, particularly in relation to the intervention in the election. And they're willing to roll back some of those sanctions and other measures if they could get something from Russia that could be taken seriously even on something like cybersecurity. So I think he had hoped for some very big sweeping gesture and warmer relations where they can cooperate on a bunch of different areas. And now, it's just much more tactical kind of relationship. And that's more traditional for what we've seen in the last couple of administrations. 

What do you think the Trump administration fears from the Senate investigation that just began today? 

I think that they don't know. You know, there's a number of people in the White House who just keep getting caught by surprise by different pieces of information that are coming out. I think that is the big fear. And that ultimately it will just -- I mean, for them, their argument is, there is nothing to see here, it's not going to lead to anything. And so, but it's something that keeps distracting for them to get implementing their agenda. It's just hanging over them, and it doesn't look like it's going to wrap up quickly. And so it's just going to linger on and on. So from their point of view, they don't expect something to come of the investigation, but they don't really know what exactly is going to come out. And you've seen this drip, drip, drip of things coming out every day, and that's been such a distraction for them. 

Do they believe they've been transparent and forthcoming in terms of trying to get to the bottom of this? 

Well, I think they feel defensive. They are, as we saw today, when you have the White House offering up intelligence for the chairs and the ranking members of the two committees to come to the White House and look at, that focuses on a very specific piece of this broader look at the Russian intervention which is where these leaks are coming from, you know, they feel frustrated. And so they feel like -- and so they're making these moves to try to position themselves or shape the investigation to go in a way they want. The problem with that is that it's intervening, or at least can be perceived as intervening, in these investigations. The one place that I would say that they will point to in terms of being transparent is their willingness to offer Jared Kushner, the president's senior advisor and son-in-law, to testify to the Senate Committee. That's an unusual thing to do because typically any time Congress asked for somebody inside the White House to come and testify, the president will exert executive privilege. And they were going out of their way to offer that up. And so they're trying to find ways to get ahead of this and appear a little bit more transparent and cooperative. Then at the same time, they're doing things like offering Senators and House members and intelligence to come and view at the White House, which looks like intervention in the investigation. 

Secretary Tillerson is on his way at some point, -- when is it -- to Russia. When will he arrive in Russia? 

He will arrive in mid-April, and will go to Moscow. And part of the White House's goal is to have this comprehensive review of the president's Russia policy wrapped up or at least have some key elements in place before he goes there, so that the conversation can actually be substantive and they can try to move forward on some of the things they want to do. And also, I think, he will be coming there with some specific messages on some of the concerns that the White House has about what Russia has been doing, both in the region, and in Syria, in terms of its relationship with Iran, and in terms of its use of cyberattacks. 

And I assume that they are hopeful that because of the relationship between Secretary Tillerson from his days as a corporate executive, you know, that there might be the possibility for some better communication than has taken place. 

Right. I think that they're hopeful about that because they're not starting from, you know, two people who aren't familiar with each other, there's a familiarity there. And so, that is something that they feel like would work in their favor. But I have talked to people about Russia this week. They're really not, they're very down on the ability to do something major with Russia, just because of the way things have been in the last two months. 

Carol, thank you so much, pleasure. 

Thank you, pleasure to be here.
