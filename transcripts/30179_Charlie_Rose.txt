'96 CBS Fall Line-Up 

One-time actor Leslie Moonves made television history as president of Warner Brothers television during the last-fall's prime-time season. Warner sold an unprecedented 20-plus shows to the major networks, including mega-hits ''ER'' and ''Friends.'' Then, in July 1995, he left to become president of CBS Entertainment. The Tiffany network hoped that Moonves can restore its ailing programming schedule with its new fall line-up. I'm pleased to have him here, not only to talk about CBS, but to talk about the dynamics of doing this rather interesting job in American television -- figuring out what's going to be on prime-time and how do you beat the competition Monday through Saturday. Welcome to the broadcast. 

Thank you very much. 

Talk to me a little bit about leaving. I mean, you were on top at Warner Brothers. You looked at ''ER'' and you looked at ''Friends'' and you looked at some series of other shows -- it was never going to be as good -- you could hardly make it any better than that. 

That's exactly how I felt. We had 22 top shows on the air. We set a record. I think our nearest competitor had 10 or 11 shows at the time, and with shows of the quality of ''ER'' and ''Friends,'' I said, ''You know what? This is about as good a year as I could ever have in this job.'' In addition, I think everybody who is on the supply side, you've always dreamed of the day, ''Well, maybe I should be the programmer. Maybe I should be the guy who fills in the little squares that says what show is going to go where,'' and at 

But you are, in a way, competing against yourself. You've got to choose a program that can do well against '' 

Absolutely, and it's very hard, especially on Friday mornings when I look at the ratings and I see how badly ''ER'' and ''Friends'' are beating my new programs. (laughter) 

But that's part of the challenge, you know. 

Looking at the fall schedule, give me a sense of the philosophy that went into it before you tell me about specific programs. What did you know you had to do? What were you looking for? What would turn it around if it worked? 

Well, the last few years, CBS -- obviously you've all heard about the great 18-to-49 age group is the age group that the advertisers want, and they want younger viewers because they, supposedly, are more influenced by advertising -- so, in the past few year, CBS had tried to get younger in terms of their audience profile. 

To get like FOX? 

To get like FOX, and I think it was totally the wrong strategy for us. The idea to get younger is to do good programs that basically hold on to your traditional audience and then expand from there. I think we didn't do that the last few years, so part of my job this year was to find shows that were somewhat traditional, in addition, and more importantly, to get the kind of stars that people would want to watch, and we went after a lot of star-power this year. 

Bill Cosby? 

Bill Cosby, Ted Danson. 

Ted Danson. Who else? 

Peter Strauss. 

Peter Strauss. 

Scott Bakula, Rhea Perlman, Mary Steenburgen, Gerald McRainey, to name a few. 

And the idea is that stars bring audience? 

No question about it. Last year, last fall, the four major networks introduced 42 new programs. Out of those 42 there were no hits. Zero. The only shows from last year that possibly can be considered hits were two mid-season shows. One was ''Third Rock from the Sun'' and the other was our show with Don Johnson called ''Nash Bridges.'' So to launch a new show right now in the crowded marketplace, we felt you needed audience recognition right away. 

Star gets you what? At least a first look? 

Exactly. That's exactly right. People are going to be curious to see what is the new Cosby show going to look like, what is the new Ted Danson show going to look like? You know, are they going to be similar to the old shows, or are they going to be brand new shows? So our job, basically, is hopefully to produce good shows, get them to the T.V. set, give them a product they like and they'll stay with you. 

It's also, when you look at all the failures built around big stars, if you don't have anything to back up the first look, you're dead in the water. 

Absolutely right. You can only open the door with your star. You'd better have a show behind them, and that was the second part of our strategy. Bring in the top show-runners. That's a very common word in Hollywood now about T.V. producers. It's called show-runners. It's the guy who is responsible for those shows. 

These are people like Diane English and Carsey-Werner and people like that? 

Exactly. Steven Bochco. There's a group of them who are the A-list of show-runners and we often say, it's not about show one. A lot of people are going to do show one. It's show 20, 30, and 100. 

You could make one good episode. 

Exactly. 

What are you going to be doing for-- 

Yes. 

Where are you in the 12th week? Where are you in the 100th week? 

Yes. 

That's like when we look at guests. We say we know what the first question is, but where do we go from there. (laughter) 

That's right. Right. 

The seventh question? What happens after that? Is it still interesting after the first or second question? 

Correct, correct. 

When you look at prime time, one big hit can turn it around, can turn a night around? If you have a Cosby hit half as good as the last Cosby, have you got a night? 

Absolutely. Absolutely. I think ''Seinfeld'' turned that night around for NBC a few years ago on Thursday night when it exploded. ''Cheers'' had done the same thing earlier on. One show with high enough ratings will carry the next show, and on and on and on. 

You get you're audience hooked. 

I absolutely does. It absolutely does. 

When I look at all these people, I also look at ''ER'' and ''Friends.'' They didn't come in, though, with big stars, did they? 

Absolutely right. Absolutely right. 

These were concept shows that worked. 

They were concept shows that were placed into already existing decent time periods. Remember, when ''Friends'' was launched it was put between ''Mad About You'' and ''Seinfeld.'' 

Yes. (laughter) 

OK? When ''ER'' was launched, it was on at 10 o'clock, it was following ''L.A. Law,'' and there wasn't a great deal of competition against it at that time. It also had a very high lead-in. It's a lot easier when you're hammocked in there. Frankly, Charlie, you and I could sit here and talk and be on at eight-thirty on Wednesday, and we'd do very well. 

Hey, not a bad idea. 

Not a bad idea. 

The Charlie and Les Show. (laughter) 

The Charlie and Les Show. I like that. A buddy comedy. 

Exactly. A couple of guys talking about sex. 

That's right. 

Monday night. Give me your schedule for Monday night. 

Monday night we're going full guns blazing. We're opening the show-- we're opening the night with Bill Cosby, followed it by Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen and what I think is the hottest new romantic comedy you're ever going to want to see. 

What's that? 

It's called ''Ink.'' 

Oh, this is the new Ted and Mary show? 

Right. The new Ted Danson show, and it's about two people who-- our opening scene is they're getting a divorce after eight months, who work at the same newspaper, and it ends up she becomes his boss, and therefore are forced to work together. 

And who's the audience? Men, women, are you looking for the baby-boomer generation? Who are you looking for? 

Primarily we are-- 24-to-54 is what we're looking for. We're not looking for the 18-to-49. That's more of the FOX audience right now, more the NBC audience. We're looking for a slightly older audience on our network. On Monday night from eight to nine, men and women. 

Then at nine o'clock, Monday Night Football comes on. 

For the first half of the year. 

That's where the men are. 

That's where most of the men are, so we go ''Murphy Brown'' and ''Cybil,'' which are much more female-oriented shows until January, and then the men come back. 

What happens on Tuesday? 

On Tuesday night we've begun a brand new show. There was a phenomena that happened this year on Saturday night at CBS, and we coined the phrase -- and it's a little bit corny but it certainly worked -- we call it ''America's Night of Television.'' It was ''Doctor Quinn,'' ''Touched by an Angel,'' and ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' with Chuck Norris. It exploded. It was the biggest surprise of the year, and there was a real craving out there from the public, from the government, from all over the place, to do more family-oriented series. 

On this topic, how do you explain that? I mean, what is it do you think happened in the body politic of the American public? 

Good question, good question. I think there has been a real change in the desire of Americans for more values, especially from their media. Obviously, we've all been criticized a lot with all the discussion about the V-chip and the violence on television as well as, I think, some of the coarsity of the language. It's not to say that I believe in the censorship that some of the people in Congress would like, but I think people are looking for a little bit more diversity, and I think we were getting away from that. So I think people are looking for shows they can sit down with their family. 

So you go all the way through Chuck Norris on Tuesday night? 

No. So that's Saturday night. So we saw a trend. Now, on Monday night-- on Tuesday night, the other two networks have two basically urban, sort of hard-hitting comedies, ''Mad About You'' and ''Roseann,'' so it's a night where we're not going to win that night. There are two very strong, established comedies. We said, ''OK. They're more urban. They're a little bit harsher. We too a spin-off of ''Touched by an Angel'' starring Gerald McRainey, called ''Home of the Brave,'' which basically is about a family on the road looking for America. It's very patriotic. It's about helping other people. It's a real family drama. 

Wednesday night? 

Wednesday night. A little bit of a risk for us, but we feel real strong. We took ''The Nanny,'' which had been winning its time period every week all season, Monday night at eight o'clock, and moved it over to Wednesday. Part of the reason is because we feel we have the greatest companion with it, which is a show called ''Pearl,'' a new show with Rhea Perlman and Malcolm McDowell. In a line -- ''Educating Rita.'' Working class lady who suddenly goes to an Ivy League college and faces the toughest professor you ever want to see with Malcolm McDowell and (unintelligible), so we feel like, suddenly-- it's once again, it's a tough night. The (unintelligible) is on one of the networks and ''Wing'' is on the other, but we think Fran Drescher, our leading lady, can stand up to any of them. 

What's the risk of shifting from one night to another night? Because we all remember when they moved ''The Simpsons'' over against ''Cosby,'' and I think it was, what was the one Robin Williams was in? They moved it and Gary Marshall, to this day, believes it killed that program. 

''Mork and Mindy.'' Absolutely right. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. 

Yes. 

The danger is, obviously, you have a loyal audience that watches a show on a specific night-- 

And now if you move it to Wednesday night, they might have another show they love there, and they're not willing to make the swap. 

That's exactly right. However, we have found, with the advent of the clicker, people are a lot more moveable. They're a lot more moveable, plus, we're competing in a different world than the old days. Used to be a nice, quiet little three-network place. Now there are six networks, there is cable, there is independent stations, there are all sorts of competition, and you have a universe of 50 channels. 

And what's the challenge with that, though? What do you have to do because now there are more choices and the clicker is more a power in the hands of the consumer? 

We have to establish our brand identity. We have to be known for something at CBS. We are, number one, the most traditional network. We do skew slightly older, and by-in-large, we stand for good values. That's what we're going for. That's what our audience is, and that's what they expect. 

How do you sell that? I mean, as a marketing idea. 

How do you sell-- well, our new slogan is ''Welcome Home.'' 

Back to the old CBS? 

Exactly. Back to the days of the Tiffany network. We're going for quality, we're going for tradition, and we're going for the best programming you possibly could imagine. 

What happens on Thursday night when it's a block-buster brand new season? 

W counter-program. We go with ''Diagnosis Murder'' with Dick Van Dyke, which is a somewhat softer show -- we had ''Murder She Wrote'' there -- as well as right after that we have an exciting new show starring Peter Strauss, who I consider a major television star. Obviously, better known for movies of the week and mini-series, but once again, skewing slightly older. He's part of the plus-forty generation, and we think against ''Seinfeld'' he will work there. He will work there. 

Friday night? 

We open with ''Dave's World.'' 

''Dave's World.'' 

You know, the old ''Dave Berry Show'' with Harry Anderson starring in it. Once again, counter-programming. NBC has ''Unsolved Mysteries,'' ABC has ''Family Matters.'' They have that TGIF line-up, you know, which is basically geared for younger children, that we feel has gotten a little bit weaker. So we have Harry Anderson going into, once again, a new show called ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' where we think we have the hot new-comedy find of the year, a kid named Ray Romano. 

Where did you find him? 

David Letterman found him. One night he appeared on ''The Letterman Show.'' He was a hot, young comic who was appearing at all the clubs and on ''Comedy Central,'' and one night the Letterman people said, ''Look at this tape.'' And they sent us this tape, and we looked at it, we signed this kid, we developed the comedy, turned out terrific. The kid went on yesterday -- we made our presentation at Carnegie Hall to about 1,500 advertisers, which was a pretty daunting experience -- this young man from Queens came out in front of 1,500 people at Carnegie Hall and killed them for five or six minutes. It was great. It was just exhilarating. He came off stage, and it was a real great moment. 

Saturday night? 

Saturday night. Saturday night, as I said, has been our other signature night. What we've done is, we've kept ''Doctor Quinn'' and ''Walker,'' which are two huge hits, and in the middle of them we put a brand new show called ''Early Edition,'' which is probably our highest-testing drama in a number of years. Concept -- if you got tomorrow's newspaper today, what would you do with it? 

Explain it to me. 

You got it-- 

Go ahead. 

The guy wakes up in the morning, opens his door, there's a newspaper. His initial instincts are go to the race track, and he does. (laughter) He goes to the race track and wins a lot of money. Then-- I'll tell you the story. There is a friend of his who gets injured that day, and he would have been able to stop it. So basically, he gets the newspaper for the next day and the headline says ''Nine Die in Holdup.'' He is able to go and stop this from happening. 

OK. Happy endings. 

So once again it's an uplifting, feel-good sort of show, which fits our profile for Saturday night. 

Tell us about certain kinds of ideas that (unintelligible). We always hear about situation comedies are strong now, ''Seinfeld'' and the rest of them. There was a time in which you saw a lot of drama, when we had ''Dallas'' and other shows. It looked like that was a trend. Is there one singular trend looking in 1996, in the fall of '96, that's going to be prevalent? 

I don't think so. I think people have gone back to what their traditions are. NBC is the hipper, urban network. We know that, they've done very well with it, they've been very successful. ABC has been trying to go a little bit more toward family, and now that Disney owns them, you're going to see more and more of the Disney-label type of show on them. FOX is-- 

What's a Disney-label type of show? 

I think much more family oriented. Much more wholesome, per se. Much more steering toward teenagers and young children, you know. We, on the other hand, are going for a larger family. We've been known as the older network -- I don't think we necessarily want to be known but that -- but our tradition will say ''quality'' rather than older. 

Is the perception of the desire to have that older network, it's now better than it used to be is it not, because the baby-boom generation is getting older? There is now, on the part of advertisers because it's a larger group moving through the demographics, they assume a higher interest in that group than they did 10 years ago. 

That's exactly right, and we're trying more and more to make the advertisers realize that 18-to-49s are not-- that's not the only game in town. The baby-boomers are 50 years old this year, and for the first time we're saying, ''You know what? Fifty to fifty-five is a very valuable age group.'' 

And they're large in number. 

And the numbers are getting larger and larger, their disposable income is large, and we're trying to convince them that, you know what? It shouldn't only be based on 18-to-49. 

News programming in prime time? 

Yes. 

You've got ''48 Hours.'' 

Right. 

You've got ''60 Minutes.'' 

Yes. 

You've got what else? 

That's it. We have the least number of news magazines on than anyone else. 

ABC or NBC has the most, as far as those are concerned? 

I think with like ''Dateline''-- like 400 hours of ''Dateline.'' 

And 

Exactly. That's correct. Those are their three news magazines. Actually, everybody was rather surprised that on Thursday night, they added another news magazine, you know, because now Wednesday night at 10 and Thursday night at 10 and Friday night at 10. 

The news audience is being split? 

They have a lot of news magazines. We have two, both we're very proud of, and we are expanding-- we're even talking to them about doing another news magazine for mid-season, which I think we'll have on. 

So you'll have something on the drawing board that you can reach up and use-- 

Absolutely. 

If the opening is there. 

Exactly. We haven't decided yet quite what that will be, but we're working with Andrew Hayward, you know, the new head of 

Fixing the morning and the rest of it. 

He's doing a lot of good work, so we're working hand-in-hand with him to figure out another time period where we could put another news magazine. 

Does sports make a difference for you? If you're strong in sports, if you have the Olympics, will it make a difference for NBC? 

Yes, it will. It will absolutely help. 

Because they can promote everything, or is it something else? 

There are two things. Number one, the ratings are huge, you know. 

Yes. 

And they can make a lot of money on that. And number two, they can begin their fall promotion-- 

Introduce the fall schedule in the summer. 

That's exactly right. A lot easier than we can. A lot easier than we can. 

What's the toughest thing about this? What would seem to be-- I mean, you would lose a lot. You look at this job and all the pressure. You've got to make a choice each time period. What's the hardest thing about it? 

Saying no. 

Saying no? 

Saying no to a lot of top-quality people. You know, you're in business with a lot of high-priced people, high quality people, people who are friends of yours, people who devote a year of their lives writing a project, producing a project -- I'm talking about pilots now -- producing it, doing the post-production, doing the research, doing the editing, and suddenly this past week, they get a phone call from me saying, ''Sorry, you didn't make it on the schedule.'' 

Do you make those calls yourself? 

Yes, I do. 

Did you have to call Warner Brothers and say, ''Sorry guys?'' 

Yep. Well, they did four pilots with us, one of which made it on the air. 

They have a contract-- you have a contractual obligation to give them some, don't you? 

We've got to give them five series over two. We've already given them two, and that's over then next-- so it's not a big deal. 

In order to get you out of your contract? 

It's more about the individual writer and producer who you're friendly with, or an actor who-- you know, part of my job is recruiting people. 

I saw an item yesterday, because I saw Allen Alda last night, that Alda may come in ''Murder One.'' 

Right. 

That would seem to be a powerhouse move by Bochco. 

Absolutely. Absolutely. That would be something that we wouldn't like to see happen. 

But it would automatically go to ABC because they had it, is that right? 

Well, ''Murder One'' is on the schedule. 

Yes, oh, I see. 

So it automatically would go to that show. 

To get him, it changes the character. 

Yes. It helps ''Murder One'' quite a bit. Helps ''Murder One'' quite a bit. 

What do the guys that produce, and I mean by that male and female, who produce winners have? What does Bochco have? What does Diane English have? What does Carsey-Werner have? What do those people have? 

There are a ton of things. ''A'' is talent. ''B'' is there's no excuse for hard work. Steven Bochco is one of the hardest-working people I've ever dealt with. You know, there's a reason he wins day after day. ''3'' is leadership ability. When you're a show-runner, when you're an executive producer, you're really leading an army of 100 people, and it's getting these people to do the best work. And ''4'' is just an instinct for what the public wants, and it's a very hard thing to come by. 

What would make your year? 

What would make my year. I think a very strong second place would make my year, and our ability to begin to look at NBC and say, ''Guys, we're coming after you.'' (laughter) 

And in a sense, Littlefield was a kind of mentor. What did he give you, a job at one point? 

He wasn't a mentor, he was a friend. 

He was a friend. 

He still is. He is one that did get me one of my first jobs in television, but now he's a competitor, and all's fair in love in war. 

Do you miss acting? 

Never. Never. My creative juices are fully taken care of right now. 

We'll have to invite the head of programming for NBC and for ABC and FOX to come on and talk about their programs. I am pleased to have 

Thank you very much. 

LES MOONVES, Executive Vice-President of CBS, Inc. and head of CBS Entertainment. We thank you for watching.
