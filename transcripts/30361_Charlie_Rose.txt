Thank you. 

We continue this evening with Peter Baker. He is the chief White House correspondent for "The New York Times." He has covered President Trump's handling of a series of international challenges from the Middle East to Asia over the last week. He writes that these events reveal that to the extent that a Trump doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this. Don't get roped in by doctrine. Peter Baker joins us now from Washington. Welcome, Peter. 

Thanks for having me. 

So tell me how you came to this conclusion that the doctrine is don't be roped in by doctrine. 

I think the last week alone has shown just how improvisational and transactional President Trump's policy really is. You know, it's not that hard to find statements from the campaign trail where he said, you know, Syria is not America's problem. We shouldn't go there. Where he said we should be working closely with Russia and stop alienating them. Where he said, you know, China shouldn't be invited to dinner, they're our enemy. And here in the last week alone he has involved us more in Syria's civil war than ever before. The first American military strike against Bashar al-Assad's government. He has alienated Russia, which in fact said that -- their prime minister said that the relationship is completely ruined. And he invited the Chinese leader to dinner in Mar-a-Lago and tried to work out some deals on trade in North Korea. So, you know, I think he is very improvisational. He himself has said he is flexible, he is not wedded to one approach. And so the idea to try to define what his foreign policy is a little tricky. 

Some have argued that if your competitor, adversary, enemy, whatever you want to call it, in nation states can't predict how you will act, it is bad because relationships between nation states depend on predictability to a degree. But also it's good because they can't make assumptions about how you will act and what you will do. And that keeps them alert. 

Well, I think that's exactly right. I think we have a perfect example of this right now in terms of North Korea, right? So North Korea has tested a number of missiles since President Trump took office clearly trying to test him to some extent as well. And he has now sent the Carl Vinson Carrier Group steaming toward North Korea. So what does this mean? What should we take the lesson from last week's Syria strike to mean in terms of his approach toward North Korea? It is a little hard to figure out. Should we look at the willingness to use force in Syria as a precursor to something else in Asia, or does he want to use that unpredictability that he has now created as a leverage to convince Pyongyang that they don't want to test him, that in fact it would be dangerous to them? 

It is not quite Nixon madman theory but somewhere in between. 

Well so far, right. Nixon madman theory was very interesting. He actually was very conscience of what he was doing. He talked with Henry Kissinger and said, you tell them that you are working for a crazy president, you don't know what he is going to do, and therefore, you know, that they should cooperate with you. It was very calculated. What I'm not sure about is whether that is the case here. Whether this is President Trump in fact deliberately trying to keep people off balance, or in fact, he's just simply responding to things as they come. He wrote in his book, his first memoir, he doesn't like to think ahead. He likes to sort of go day by day, not rather planning far, far in advance. So it's sort of in keeping with that approach he took in business. 

Some have said and you have written I think that he seems to want to do, now speaking of President Trump, whatever is against or the opposite of what President Obama did. 

Yes. I think there's something to that. Look, he had the president of Egypt in to the White House last week. Remember, of course, this is former General Sisi who took over in the military takeover a few years back and President Obama refused to let him come to the White House. President Trump not only invited him to the White House but basically lavishes praise on him, makes no mention of the tens of thousands of people who have been in prison since his takeover. Similarly, you know, I think he decided to strike Syria in response to the chemical attack, even though he said to President Obama you should not do it. But in effect, he is saying, I'm doing what President Obama did not do, I'm fulfilling the red line that he has set, you know, in that 2013 circumstance. So he does seem to be influenced by a desire not to be President Obama. A lot of new presidents are. They do want to be different than their predecessor. Sometimes it takes awhile until they come around to the idea that some of the things that their predecessor did wasn't necessarily wrong. But it takes a while. Certainly a while for President Obama to feel that way about President Bush. Certainly a while for President Bush to feel that way about President Clinton. 

Back to the doctrine, is there a sense anywhere of what President Trump's strategy is as the next step in what he wants to do in Syria? 

Yes, we've been getting nothing but mixed messages these last few days. You hear from Secretary of State Tillerson on Sunday that other than asking Assad not to use chemical weapons, our policy hasn't changed. And then you hear from Nikki Haley saying look, Assad basically can't govern. He doesn't have legitimacy anymore. You hear Secretary of State Tillerson then today in Italy say a rather extraordinary thing, we commit to holding account any and all of those who commit crimes against innocents around the world. That is a pretty expansive theory of responsibility of American leadership in the world. But then you hear back in Washington, Sean Spicer is asked what is our policy. He says, well, we haven't changed. We still believe America first. We're not going to be the world's policemen. So we haven't quite seen a very clear indication of what the policy is going forward in Syria or more broadly. And really interesting, since Thursday night and that cruise missile strike, the one person you want to hear from the most on this, is the one person we haven't, that is President Trump. He hasn't said one thing since Thursday night about the Syria situation other than he used Twitter to thank the American military forces and to defend the decision not to hit the runway at the Syrian air base. 

That is all we have heard by a man who has soared by tweeting early morning. 

Absolutely. He left his advisers out there to make his case to the public and in, often, contradictory ways, and he hasn't felt the need to clarify it. So that may be in fact a conscience strategy on his part to leave a little ambiguity, leave a little confusion out there, and maybe he thinks that is a good thing. Or maybe he hasn't really decided for himself. Maybe he doesn't really understand yet where he wants to go in terms of setting lines himself. For instance, Sean Spicer, the White House Press Secretary, today said, if you use chemical weapons, if you drop barrel bombs, then you can expect a response from this president. Well, barrel bombs are a very different thing than chemical weapons. These are conventional bombs. They are horrible. 

Yes. 

But they're used all the time, 495 times last month alone. If the United States are going to respond to that every time, that is a very different level of intervention. The White House quickly then walked that back and said, well, that's not quite what we meant. So they are still trying to figure it out, it seems to me. 

How much unity is there within the White House because we hear about feuding factions on this issue and others. 

Yes, and well, this plays into that sort of internal struggle that we've been talking about for now a week or so -- Steven Bannon, Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus -- you know, Steven Bannon is a believer that we should not get ourselves more involved in these Middle East conflicts, that it is not in America's national interest to decide who is going to run Syria, that we shouldn't try to presume to get involved. And he lost basically that fight, at least temporarily this last week when President Trump decided to launch that cruise missile strike. He argued against it, whereas Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior advisor, was in favor of a robust response in order to send a message. So there are some differences within the administration that we are seeing playing out. 

The administration has a victory. They have a supreme court justice that they wanted to see, they've nominated and now have seen confirmed. Where do they go next? 

Well, that's a big deal actually for them. And President Trump today seemed eager to get a little credit for it. He said look, I did that in 100 days, that's not easy. And he's right, that is a big deal and it's really key to his political support in a conservative base. He promised last year that he would put a conservative in that seat that Justice Scalia vacated when he passed away last year. That was important to consolidate conservatives behind him and he fulfilled that promise today by putting Neil Gorsuch, who is a favorite of conservatives, on the bench. Where it goes next is interesting. Standing next to Neil Gorsuch today was Justice Anthony Kennedy. He is a swing vote, of course, on the court. He's 80 years old, and he's feeling a little bit of his health, I think lately, and there is a desire to sort of see if they can't encourage him, if he wants to think about retiring. And one way to encourage him is by putting on Neil Gorsuch, a former clerk into that seat. 

Did Gorsuch clerk for Kennedy? 

He did. He clerked for Kennedy, also for Byron White, he was a dual clerk there, in effect. 

Thank you for joining us, pleasure. 

Great talking to you.
