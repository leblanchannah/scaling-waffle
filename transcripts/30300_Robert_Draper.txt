President Trump suffered his first major legislative defeat on Friday. His signature campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare unraveled when Speaker Paul Ryan withdrew the GOP health care bill after failing to secure enough votes. Despite having majority in the House, the president and his team proved unable to bridge deep divisions within the Republican Party. Joining me now from Washington is Robert Draper. His new feature in "The New York Times" magazine is called "Trump Versus Congress: Now What?" I'm pleased to have Robert Draper back on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

How did this piece come about? 

Well, at the beginning of January, I had been talking, of course, to Trump along the campaign trail, getting a sense of what he would like to do. He had told me that the two things he wanted to do most of all were creating jobs and negotiating with foreign leaders. But he made a series of promises along the campaign trail, and I thought given that this is a man who is new to Washington, given as well that he has got a lot of unorthodox notions, he and his senior advisor, Steve Bannon, that kind of cut across party ideologies, given finally the fact that the Republicans hadn't been in charge for awhile and frankly, you know, when they controlled one part of the legislative branch, didn't govern so well, it was going to be interesting to see exactly how their legislative agenda rolled through. So I began kind of on a leisurely basis to interview people for the story, it began to pick up speed in March and as Obamacare began to implode, I interviewed a number of people in the Trump White House including the president himself. Then when the story or when the replacement actually did implode on Friday, we finished up the story and put it out on the web 48 hours later. 

That's what you call good timing, I think. 

I think so. It's better to be lucky than good. (LAUGHTER) 

So where do you think the president sees himself going now? 

Well, I think that he has convinced himself that it was never his idea to begin with, to repeal and replace Obamacare as his opening gambit. And I think that is, by the way, right, Charlie. I do think that a number of people had convinced him that this was going to be a chip shot. Something he could do in his first couple of weeks in office and move right on to things that were of greater interest to him. So I think that he is a bit disappointed that people led him astray. Paul Ryan, he is not throwing to the wolves just yet, but it's clear that Speaker Ryan is on probation. I think, frankly, the chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is as well. And for that matter, Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, this is supposed to be his baby, and it's not altogether clear what he did constructively to advance the ball. So the president is gonna turn the page, go on to tax reform. He is eager most of all, Charlie, to put up, as he puts it, a win. The problem all along has been what constitutes a win. He didn't have much of a vision for Obamacare and we'll see -- his vision is already shifting somewhat on tax reform. 

But he also has a new realization about the nature of Republicans in Congress. He may have thought that he had the ability to convince them of something that they ideologically weren't prepared to accept. 

That's right. I think that he came in figuring if he woos these guys, you know, this 435 members of the House of Representatives, or rather, the 237 who are Republican, invite them to the Oval Office, let them sit in Mike Pence's chair, that they will be so impressed by the experience that they will do whatever he wants. For some, perhaps, that was sufficient. But whatever else one will say about the Freedom Caucus, they may have trouble saying yes, but they don't have trouble saying no. 

Certainly not. 

And that's precisely what they did to the president on Obamacare. 

Even when a president can say, look how much better I did in your district than you did. 

Yes, you know, that is an interesting point. A lot of us thought well, you know, and Steve Bannon had said this to me as well, Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, too, that Trump was immensely popular in their districts and these people are not so much conservatives, they are Trump voters. They are working class voters. And they will basically sign on to whatever the president endorses. But that turned out not to be the case and I've been hearing from at least a couple of members from the Freedom Caucus who voted -- who said they were going to vote no on this, that they have been treated just fine back home. That essentially the constituents right now are willing to blame Speaker Ryan, but they certainly don't blame the Freedom Caucus for having refused to budge. 

And don't blame the president. 

They don't blame the president yet. Actually, I think they will, in the end, blame their own House members, their dually elected officials, before they blame President Trump. His base remains strong. Obviously, his approval ratings are down, I think down now to 37 percent or so, 35 maybe in one poll. But his base remains pretty much intact. 

Tell me about the workings inside the White House. Because I read one story after another. How did you find that faction looking to you? 

Well, there have been times when Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus have found themselves to be allies, times when Jared Kushner and Bannon have as well. And Gary Cohn and Steve Bannon see eye-to-eye on certain things, on economic issues less so. So I do think that it's right, there is a more left of center contention in the White House who hailed from the east coast, you just named them. That there are people like Stephen Miller, the senior policy advisor, who occupied the hard right, you know, he comes from Jeff Sessions' world. And Steve Bannon largely occupies that as well. Bannon is a very clever operator. And I think that he understands when it's time to give up the fight. I also think by the way that like President Trump, Bannon was not married to -- you know, Obamacare repeal and replace is not about economic nationalism. This was about campaign mop-up work. It was about fulfilling a campaign pledge and moving on to a populist agenda. So I don't think his heart was in it. And I also think that you know, he's, for whatever other collateral damage will take place, I think Bannon is going to be just fine with the president at least for now. 

Look what Bannon said about Ryan's tax reform plan. "I would actually say that this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is." I mean, when you think of the word economic nationalism, the next thing you think of is Steve Bannon. 

Sure, that is right. That is what Bannon had told me, that he had said to Paul Ryan when those guys met before inauguration to hash out tax reform, up to that point, Charlie, Bannon pretty much loathed Ryan. He believed that Paul Ryan stood for everything that was reprehensible about the Republican Party. They were completely out of touch. That they were these sort of austere fiscal conservatives who really did not understand what the working class was feeling. And on tax reform, they achieved a kind of bromance. But largely over the particular angle of the border adjustment tax. And to me, I asked President Trump, are you in on this? I have heard, frankly, mixed messages from the White House about whether or not this is your thing. He said, oh, are you kidding? I'm the king of that! Though he said he was the king of it, he then went on to explain to me that every other country has an import tax except for the U.S. He said that we're the only fools who don't have it. That is factually inaccurate. What other countries have is a value added tax, but that is not a corporate tax grafted on to an import tax such as the kind that he is proposing. 

How did Steve Bannon and Donald Trump come together? 

They came together, they met back, I think in 2011 or 2012. They were introduced by Dave Bossie, who later became the deputy campaign manager, but had worked for the Koch brothers. But really the evolution of Bannon coming into Donald Trump's world, Charlie, began, as I reported in "The New York Times" magazine story, with a dinner that Bannon had with Senator Jeff Sessions and the senator's top aide, Stephen Miller, at the so-called Breitbart Embassy in January 2013. During that time, you'll remember Romney had just gotten clobbered and the belief among Republicans was we've got to do something about the Latino voter because Romney lost by 44 points in the Hispanic demographic. And Bannon, Sessions, and Miller were of a totally different mind. They believed, in fact, that there should be a more hard line view of immigration and on trade and that very evening, Bannon tried to convince Sessions to run for president. Sessions looked down into his soul for about an 1/8 of a second and said no, I'm not that kind of guy, I'm content here in the Senate. So Bannon went looking for another candidate and just a couple of months after that dinner, he happened to see Trump speak at CPAC. And again, he'd met Trump before, but he'd never heard such fiery rhetoric. He told me that Trump brought the house down. So he, Bannon had been interested in Sarah Palin before, tried to get her to run for president. He saw in Trump someone who was at least as charismatic if not more so than her, but was connecting with the public more so, and it was through a series of events after that that he insinuated his way into Trump world. 

For people who have read and have heard everything about Steve Bannon, how would you define him? 

Well, he's a really, really smart guy. He's an autodidact. You know, he reads a lot of books, but he's one of those kinds of guys who doesn't complete a book. He'll read certain points, certain passage of a book, and put it down and do another. He works very late hours. He is a self-styled loner, kind of likes being a rebel. Likes the fact that he has an unusual portfolio, having worked at Goldman Sachs, having been in the Navy, having gotten rich off of "Seinfeld" reruns and then ultimately becoming the CEO of Breitbart and working his way into right wing politics. And believing that he saw something about the American electorate that all of these self-styled and very wealthy political consultants did not. He is very proud of the fact that he could see in Wisconsin, for example, a discontent among the working class electorate that locals like Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan failed to see. And it was for that reason that Trump sort of honed his message of economic nationalism, of populism to those kinds of voters and prevailed in states like Wisconsin. 

The title of your piece is Trump Versus Congress: Now What? Now what, is tax reform and perhaps infrastructure spending? 

Yes, perhaps. I mean, you know, Charlie, it seems, you know, and this is what the Trump White House and for that matter, the Speaker's office, have been saying, that while tax reform is going to be a win for us because it is natural territory for Republicans, we love to cut taxes, all of that is true. But the border adjustment tax, for example, is very, very controversial. People on K Street hate it, big businesses hate it. And my suspicion is they will drop it. They like it mainly because it scores, you know, in $1.2 trillion or something like that. So it is worth pointing out that we have been talking about these difficulties thus far that Trump has had with Congress. But who does that really consist of? House Republicans. Those should be the people most easy for him to communicate with. He has yet to deal with Democrats. He has yet to deal with the Senate. And in tax reform, you know, Lindsey Graham and others there say that that package, if it includes say a border adjustment tax, is dead on arrival. So it remains to be seen whether this is going to be the sought-after win for the Trump administration. After that comes infrastructure, which is going to be a very heavy lift because House Republicans don't like the idea of spending a ton of money, essentially a stimulus project. There are a lot of moderate republicans who would go for it, plenty of people in the Senate, a lot of Democrats who might play along, too. But as Bob was alluding to earlier, it remains to be seen whether Democrats will want to give Trump a win. If he is really bleeding electorally speaking in terms of approval ratings, they may just sort of let him flounder. They may sense the possibility to actually take back the House, and maybe possibly the Senate, and of course, have an inside path to 2020. 

It is a fascinating article. Thank you so much. 

My pleasure.
