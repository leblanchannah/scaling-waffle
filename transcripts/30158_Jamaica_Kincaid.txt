Jamaica Kincaid is one of America's most daring and preeminent prose writers. She interweaves memory with imagination to create blunt, tragic and beautiful stories. Her latest effort is a memoir called, My Brother. It chronicles her return to her native Antigua for a fourth reunion with her brother as he was dying of AIDS. Joining me here for a conversation about all of this and the importance of writing honestly is Jamaica Kincaid. Welcome. 

Thank you, thank you very much. 

Nice to see you again. 

Very nice to be here. 

Tell me about the experience first, which is sort of this book, going back to Antigua because your brother is ill. 

Well, I'd left. I'd been sent away when I was sixteen. 

As a nanny. 

Yes. To, in fact, help support this extra person in our family. I didn't see him. I didn't see him for twenty years. Then I saw him again, because I'd had a daughter and thought it wouldn't be a good thing for me to raise a family while being alienated from my own family. I sort of tried to make some thing work there. It didn't succeed. Then in 1993, one night, was in January, I got a call saying that he was in hospital. I knew it instantly that somehow it was AIDS, but even as I remember saying it, I remember wanting them to say, "Oh, no. Not that." But it was. 

Why did you think it was AIDS? 

Because he lived that kind of life. I remember once my mother visiting me and he was in hospital. He had gonorrhea. He was said to have gonorrhea in his knees. Somehow it had gone into his knees. I said, "Did he have an AIDS test?" Because it seemed to me if you have that kind of drastic venereal disease it must say something. My mother said, "Oh, for heaven's sakes, no." He lived a sort of life that is associated with get the disease. I did not know about his homosexuality. I thought he was a promiscuous heterosexual person, but he was. 

Because he talked that way. 

He talked that way, and he acted that way. When I think of it, later, when I discovered his secret life, I realized that it had all been too acting that way. He flirted with women as if it was a play, as if he was acting. I can see that it suddenly all had a falseness. While he was ill, you know, I kept wondering how he got it. Not for any other reason, than I thought if I knew how he got it, he would tell me something, but I never dreamt that he was gay, at all, or had relationships with men. 

You go there and you've, because of the call. 

Yes. 

What happens then? 

I find myself plunged back this life I lead. What was interesting, to me, is I'm fairly willful. 

No kidding. 

I'm sorry to say. I do know this about myself. 

So does the rest of the world. 

Well, I -- I've been able to keep myself away from my family for a long time and protect myself from them. This I wasn't able to do. I just immediately found myself back again. I suppose it happened because I could manage it. I could manage to be there and not lose myself. I often thought I might die doing it. I often thought, "Oh, the plane will crash. Something terrible will happen." I didn't think I was doing anything good, mind you. I wasn't trying to be consciously good or kind or anything. I was acting in a way I couldn't help, really. Which is very odd for me. 

How do you explain that? 

I do not know. I do not know. I suspect that I had the feeling that in some ways that his life could have been mine. If I hadn't left, if I hadn't become a writer, I wouldn't have lived as long as I have, so far. I've always said that, you know. I've always said that. I write to save my life. It turned out to be extremely true, not just something I say. I think I really don't say things that are not true. I have a deep sense of what's true or what I feel to be true and I act on it. I may be wrong, but that doesn't mean that it's not true. 

Tell me about this relationship with your mother and how it interplayed when you went back. 

Well, well, the interesting thing about my mother and my brothers is that in a strange way, because my mother does not like women, other women I should say, my being a woman, my gender in some ways, saved me, because my life at home was so uncomfortable that I never wanted to go back to it. I wanted only to leave it. My brothers have an easier time with my mother. She's more forgiving. She loves them in a way that's really almost a trap. It's like some sort of tar or something, they get caught in it, or honey, or something. 

Her love sticks them to her? 

Yes. They're still around her. They've never really been able to leave her. I never had that difficulty, really. I mean, in fact, I didn't see her once for twenty years, and that was quite (inaudible). I thought I'd never seen her again. 

Did anything change as you sat there watching your brother die? 

No. Not really. I did feel sorry for her because I thought I wouldn't have liked that. I don't want to bury my children. No, things actually didn't change. They got -- They didn't grow worse. They didn't grow better. They remained the same. We ended up in a period of not speaking to each other again, which is how the book begins. We were not speaking to each other. Now we're not again. It's just way -- 

You're not again, because? 

Oh, we just don't. After a while we just don't speak to each other. 

What happened between you and your brother? 

We quarreled, too. It's a tradition in my family. We all quarrel with each other. He and I quarreled the last time I visited him. Then he died. I think I always wanted him to change. Well, not so much change. I wanted him, in some ways, to take control, not control, possession of his life. I wanted his- He was a brilliant boy and very handsome man, just extremely attractive. I wanted, I suppose, him to do what I had done. He and I were in the way, most alike. We're sort of the book ends. I'm first, he's last. I think I wanted him to do what I had done. I knew he was going to die, but I didn't want him to die lost. He did die lost. 

Lost means what? 

Lost in the world. He never found himself, never, really. I can see that. I can see that he never knew who he was, never- Didn't have, I mean, it turns out, I think, that to possess yourself, takes a certain amount of courage and determination. He didn't really have that in his entire life. He just didn't know how to take hold of himself. He was sort of a dreamer, which I used to be and still am. I mean, I love, I live to daydream, but he really couldn't shake himself out of it. 

Why is this story important to tell, for you? 

Well, all my stories are important to tell, for me. I feel I -- It's the way to understand who I am and who I've been, as an individual and as part of a group. It's very important to me to tell the stories, not important to me that you read it, only the sense that when you read it, it means I get royalties. That's a very nice thing to have, an income, but in the end it's not important to me that you read it. In the very, very end, it's not important to me that you read it, that you like it, that you understand it, but it's deeply important to me that I write it. 

Because? 

I wouldn't know how to live without sorting out the things that I think. 

You live by spending most of your time putting into words your life experiences, and to put them into words, you have to sort them out and try to understand them before you can articulate them. 

Well, this is true, but it's more than my own experiences, I like. I like to understand what happened to the people I'm from, how they got here, how I got here. How I came to love who I love and so on. I like to understand it. I don't know how to do it in any other way. 

What if somebody stepped forward to say, "Enough, Jamaica, of this painful childhood. We got it the first time, just stop." 

Oh, I think quite a few reviewers have done that. I think it annoys them a great deal that I do not stop, because it isn't for them that I do it. That's not -- 

As you just said. 

Yes. I do it because this is what I do. Likewise, I can say to someone, in return, "You know, it's not me who should stop writing, perhaps it's you who should -- You know what this is going to be about, don't read it. Read something else." 

If you're not looking for honesty from me, don't stop at my book. 

Yes, but it's an interesting thing. I wonder why I would be criticized for actually, maybe I have tried to make something good of it, maybe a work of art of it, maybe- No one ever says, "Oh, this is bad writing." 

No, they don't say that. 

They only say that they're tired of this particular subject. 

This story. Right. 

Which is, frankly, I'm tired of my story, too, but it's all I have, is my story. I don't have their story. I don't have yours. 

That's the only thing you want to write, is your story. 

(crosstalk) Like my story. I'm tired of it, but I like it. It's mine. 

You left when you were seventeen, we just discussed this in other programs. For someone who didn't see that, what is it that's so, what's so painful about your life? What is it that you can't? 

Well, of course, I don't know this, that it's painful. I only know that it's my life. 

People read it as pain. 

Yes. There are all sorts of things you read as pain, not to compare myself to anything great, but I believe it's, somebody just mentioned, the Book of Job, it's painful. I don't see. All sorts of things are painful. I can't think of -- There's something about people who look like me, I think. By that, I'm alluding to race, but there's something about someone who looks like me, who if they speak frankly, race in gender, if they speak frankly about history, a) it's painful, and then therefore it shouldn't be said. 

Well, I hope they don't say that. 

They don't say it, but basically the idea is, you know, you've why this painful childhood, but I think if I were -- 

There's one -- I'm going to be honest -- 

No. I think you're being a very good devil's advocate, or, is that how it's said? Devil's? In any case. 

Sometimes they just say devil. 

Yes. 

They leave off the advocate. 

In any case, it's quite possible that if I were a man of your complexion, that no one would say this at all, that it might be -- 

They would say how brilliantly honest of him to say -- 

Yes. Or something like that. Or something like that, but there is, really, people who like me, if we speak frankly our lives we're accused of all sorts of things, including, you know, politicizing everything. Without anyone seeming to notice that among the great texts we refer to, you know, it's about pain. If you wanted to read Homer, if you want to read the Bible, any of these things, they're not pretty, but we enjoy them quite happily. 

What did you find out about dying? 

What did I find out about dying? That it is very hard to do. It's very hard on the person dying, though it is very hard on the person looking at them, but at least they're dying, that's what I would say. I got very -- It takes a long time, unless it happens suddenly, but when someone is dying, it's very long. I found out about AIDS. I just said it to somebody earlier today, but I'll say it to you again. I found out, I think, that the difference between AIDS and other things, is that, or that having this HIV virus, is that, you and I, or people who do not have the HIV virus are alive with the shadow of death over their shoulders, but I could see with my brother, that he was dead and it was the shadow of life that was over his shoulders. I learnt that. About death, I learned, well, just such clichÃ© things, you know, how surprising it is, how unknowable it is, how mysterious it is, how it leaves you with, really, speechless. Wailing is a good -- 

Incomprehension. 

Yes. It's incomprehensible. Crying is good. Wailing is good. 

When my mother died, the first thing I wanted to do. I just wanted to, while I was watching her die, literally, closer than I am to you, I just wanted to know everything. That was my- I mean, what is she feeling, thinking? Does she hear me? I mean, all of that. 

Yes. But you must -- 

What is it for her? What is it for her? 

Yes. 

Not, sort of, some speculation about is there something out there, but just what is she -- 

Yes, you know, it's funny, you say that because when I used to bring my brother pen and paper, even had someone make him a little lap desk, because I thought he would tell me things like that, but he wasn't used to looking inwards, so he couldn't tell. He couldn't know. Yes, you do want to know what it's like, but it's one of those things that once you have the experience, that's it. Maybe there are people on somewhere who have died writing books. 

On the other side? 

Yes. 

This book is called My Brother. Our friend Jamaica Kincaid, thank you.
