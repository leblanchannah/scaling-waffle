underestimated the spread of the AIDS virus worldwide and that there are now over 30 million people living with HIV. It is a startling increase from last year's estimated 20 million. Joining me now for a conversation about the latest findings and statistics on one of the most pervasive and mind-boggling plagues in history David Ho -- he is the director and >>CEO of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and Time magazine's 1996 Man of the Year -- and Sandy Thurman. She is the director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy: Thank you. Dr. 

Thank you. 

What is this all about? ''U.N. estimates double rate of spread of AIDS virus,'' a new, grimmer portrait of AIDS. David? Dr. 

Obviously, the epidemic is raging on. I think in this country we have seen tremendous progress made in AIDS research and there's some degree of complacency settling in and these numbers are waking all of us up and telling us that this epidemic is just spreading with enormous dimensions. 

Is this stunning to you? Dr. 

I think so. I mean, previously I thought we were having 8,000, 9,000 cases of new 

Yeah. Put some-- put some body on this number. 

Well, I think, you know, it's a couple of things. First of all, I think we weren't able to capture the data accurately when we were counting in the past. But in addition to that, part of this is that the epidemic is moving much faster, spreading much faster than we had originally anticipated. And I think that's really bad news for us. Globally, obviously, the numbers are staggering and I think it was a shock to all of us that the numbers were as large as they are. Don't you think that's true? Dr. 

Absolutely. 

Now, can we look at these numbers and say it's increasing most rapidly here, among this kind of population group, this kind of country, this kind of-- what? 

Absolutely. Ninety percent of all of the infections of HIV around the world are in the poorest countries in the world and these numbers certainly reflect that. Rates of new infection in the United States are holding about steady at 40,000 a year, which is certainly not an acceptable number, but in the poorest countries, particularly in Africa, in Asia and in the former Soviet Union, we see rapidly increasing numbers of infection and that's-- it's going to be very challenging for us because prevention is going to be more difficult to do in those countries than it is even here in the United States. 

And are there differences in HIV virus positive people in Africa than they are-- or are they primarily heterosexual, rather than homosexual? Those kinds of things. 

Sure. Globally, almost-- somewhere between 75 percent and 85 percent of all infections are in heterosexuals or as a result of heterosexual sex transmission. So I think that's interesting because it defies the stereotypes that we have here in the United States still about who has 

Yeah. Is there-- because this is where you gained so much attention-- I, coming into this year, felt like, believed that progress was being made because of the so-called ''cocktail'' and the combination of new drug therapies and that it was a path that was going to lead us to dramatic breakthroughs. Where are we? Dr. 

There has been tremendous progress made in AIDS research and particularly in the development of new therapies. These combination of drugs, including the new protease inhibitors, have really made a tremendous difference in the affected population in this country and in Europe. But unfortunately, these therapies are too expensive, too complicated to administer worldwide. As Sandy said earlier, most of the infections are occurring elsewhere, in the poorest countries, and these therapies are out of the question. So while it's promising for the American patients, they're simply not available to the Africans, to the Asians who are so severely affected by HIV. 

And where is it in terms of where this combination, some call ''cocktails'' of therapies-- where is that in terms of bringing us closer to some ultimate breakthrough? Dr. 

Well, it's-- it's-- 

I mean, is it all-- does it put us pretty far down the road on that process? Dr. 

I think the past two years have been tremendous for some patients. We-- with these use of these cocktail, we're able to control the virus rather well now in infected individuals, so that in many patients who are so treated, the virus falls very rapidly and quite often, after a few weeks or a few months, the virus is not detectable in the blood anymore. That is not to say the virus is gone. 

It is dormant in some way? Dr. 

It is. In fact, we now know from recent studies that it's hiding out in some cells. But at least over 99 percent of the virus is now gone and this-- this reduction in virus is associated with substantial benefit to the patient and some partial restoration of the immune system. So it is a long way toward getting to the ultimate objective of getting rid of the virus, but we're not there yet. 

And how do you build on that? I mean-- Dr. 

Well, we have to continue to build drugs that would shut the virus down or keep the virus down and we have to develop new strategies to flush out the reservoir that remains right now. There's a tiny bit of virus that remains and we have to figure out new ways of getting rid of that. 

Are you getting close to that? Dr. 

I think-- I-- we really can't say whether we're close or not. I think people are now implementing certain strategies that, in theory, might work and I think over the next year, such plans will be implemented and tested. 

As a researcher, what is your dream? Dr. 

Of course, I think everybody -- my colleagues, myself -- would like to be able to control the virus, if not eliminate the virus. But the larger goal is to make a substantial impact on the epidemic globally and that we don't think we'll be able-- 

For those who have it, 

For those who have it and for those who might catch it in the future. I think we know this epidemic is spreading so quickly. In order to control that, I think we need to develop an effective vaccine. Aside from all the prevention measures that need to be taken, a vaccine is the ultimate way to control viral epidemics. 

I'm coming to you in just a minute, Sandy. Is there a consensus that that is, in fact, where you want to go, vaccine? Dr. 

I think-- we certainly want to continue to work on therapies to help those-- 

Right. Dr. 

--who are infected, but a vaccine would help curtail this epidemic. If this is allowed to continue for many more years, we're going to be looking at 100 million cases worldwide in a few more years and that's unacceptable. 

Yeah. What-- what do you want to do? I mean, what's your mandate, from the chair you sit in? 

I think several things. I think it's to keep our focus on prevention, in terms of education, and certainly, prevention, in terms of a vaccine, and then to continue our focus on the therapies, like those that David has helped us with, to make sure that we're able at some point in time to contain this epidemic. I mean, the fact of the matter is that even if we had effective vaccines today, we wouldn't be able to contain this epidemic till way on down the road, probably outside our lifetime. And when we look at what we've done in polio, the fact that we've had a vaccine for 40 years which is cheap, easy to administer, we still haven't eradicated polio from the face of the earth. We still spend $235 million a year in the United States alone immunizing our children -- and adults, for that matter -- against a disease that's no longer present in the Western hemisphere. But until we eradicate polio, we simply can't afford not to immunize our citizens. So I think we have to look at the big picture. First of all, we need to make sure people have the information they need not to get infected. That's our first track. The second is when people are infected and, in fact, have been infected, we have to make sure that we have therapies to treat them and, ultimately, a cure and then, at the same time, focus on a vaccine so that we-- that people simply aren't at risk. So we have several tracks that we have to follow and that's my job and our job, I think, in the administration is to make sure that we're not getting off the track on any of those. 

My friend, Larry Kramer-- 

Yes. 

--comes to this table-- you know about Larry? 

Yes. Absolutely. 

Comes to this table and time after time says to me, ''There are too many people not working together and they don't have enough money to do it.'' And on the other hand, we have people who raise up and say, ''Let's compare how much money we're spending for cancer and heart disease and-- with AIDS and all of this. And they get all exercised over relative priorities and relative dangers and relative threats and how many people are dying from what kind of thing. But let me just stick with this notion. If you had a ton more money, if you had not what you have-- what's your budget? 

We have-- we spend about $7 billion in the United States. 

Suppose you had not $7 billion, but $50 billion. 

Right. 

What difference would it make? 

Well, I think it would make a tremendous difference. I mean, we certainly would be able to provide more treatments to people who need them, including-- (crosstalk) 

--protease-- 

Therapies, uh-huh. We would be able to spend more on outreach and prevention, target our messages to people who need them, like women and children and people of color, who are the fastest-rising numbers in our epidemic in this country. We'd be able to focus more on research, although we're continuing to elevate our research budget every year. And we'd be able to get some of these treatments and therapies that we already have to people in the developing world, which I think is really important. And I think that's one of our biggest ethical challenges in this epidemic and one that we've certainly-- 

Now, that's our responsibility to do that or is it somebody else's responsibility? 

No, I think it's a global responsibility. It's not just the United States of America. It's certainly all of the countries that have some resources available to support-- not pay for, necessarily, but to support other nations who are grappling under the weight of this-- with this disease and sort of, you know, crumbling under the weight of it. 

And what do you say to this idea of priorities and what disease gets the attention? 

Well, I think that's, you know, sort of a moot argument. It's-- it's-- we're doing research because this is a disease, number one, that's fairly new, that's contagious, that hits women, that hits young people, that hits everybody. And the research that we're doing on HIV and AIDS, particularly on the immune system, benefits Alzheimer's and cancer and all the rest. So to try to compartmentalize, I think, is not in anyone's best interests because this research, as David will attest, benefits all diseases and all citizens. 

We all know -- we all know -- about the competition that existed to develop-- to identify the HIV virus. I mean, that's been-- the story's been told even in Hollywood. Is there cooperation among people-- I mean, you're the guy who got all the attention because of your outstanding work. Is there cooperation among researchers on this or is everybody saying, ''I'm going for my Nobel''? Dr. 

Well, many scientists are very competitive individuals and I think AIDS research is a very competitive area. But my-- from my vantage point, over the-- over the current decade and also past decade, I think there's a lot more cooperation these days. I know that our research project within our institute is tightly linked to many groups throughout the country in a very collaborative way and those type of collaborative endeavors are very beneficial to each other and I think that's what we need. I think no single group or individual would have the necessary capability to tackle a big problem in >>AIDS research. And I think people are doing it together in vaccine: Do you have the research-- the resources you need to do everything that ought to be done in your specific line of inquiry? 

Well, I think-- I think we could always use more resources, but I think we have now sufficient resources to carry on the projects of highest interest to us. And we're certainly happy with that, but you know, there are always a few new projects that require additional funding that would allow you to move in new directions very quickly. So I don't want to indicate that we have everything we need. But I think the U.S. research dollar is quite healthy in this particular area and there's now better organization nationally and there's a concerted effort, for example, to pursue a vaccine, which would benefit the whole world. 

I know how cautious everybody wants to be because of hopes that it gives to people that might not be there and that's even worse than anything, is to give false hope to people. But-- Dr. 

Sure. 

--are we within reach in the next five years from a vaccine that-- you know? Or what-- give me some-- Dr. 

Well, our president already declared that we shall have a vaccine in a decade. 

Right. A decade from when? Dr. 

From this past summer. 

Oh, okay. 

Last May. 

Right. Dr. 

Right. It's an ambitious goal. Obviously, there are many scientists in the field who believe that is possible. Vaccine protection in monkeys is already achievable. 

So you can inject monkeys with some kind of-- Dr. 

Vaccine. 

--vaccine and they don't get AIDS. Dr. 

AIDS. 

HIV virus. Dr. 

When you inject the virus into such monkeys. But those protective vaccines are deemed unsafe-- 

Because of what? Dr. 

--for human use. Because the most protective form that we have so far is a live, attenuated vaccine. 

So you inject the virus itself into-- Dr. 

It's a weakened variant of the AIDS virus and that we're not prepared to do in human beings simply because there's a chance that the weakened virus may, in itself, cause disease in a small percentage of vaccinated individuals. 

Is that the basis of the polio vaccine? Dr. 

We initially had a killed form of polio vaccine, but the Sabine vaccine that came along is, in fact, a live virus, but weakened. 

Yeah. Dr. 

And it is protective. There are many vaccines that are live, attenuated vaccines, for example, mumps-measles-rubella, three vaccines that children get routinely. Those are live viruses, but quite weakened and so the rate of complication is actually pretty rare. But for 

And for you? Dr. 

For me, personally, I think, at least in the monkeys, with one popular form of the live, attenuated vaccine, it's causing disease in about 5 to 10 percent of the monkeys. That's unacceptable. 

Sure. Dr. 

And now-- 

What's acceptable? Dr. 

Well, it would have to be so rare that it would-- you know, it's hard to put a number. It depends on what population you're going to apply your vaccine. If you're going to go to an area where the risk of catching HIV is so high and the-- you know, the risk-benefit ratio would be appropriate, then you might accept, say, 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 10,000. It depends on the locale where the vaccine would be applied. 

Okay. What's your message today, on the eve of-- 

World AIDS Day? 

--World AIDS Day? 

Uh-huh. Well, I think the biggest message-- 

What do you want people to know? 

Well, I think we need to take stock of these numbers and understand that this epidemic is not over. It's far from over. In fact, I think we may well be at the beginning of this epidemic, rather than close to the end. 

You do? 

Uh-huh. 

Do you think so? Dr. 

Well, I think these numbers suggest that, you know, we could be at this part of the epidemic where it's beginning to take off. And unless we really make a substantial impact, what would the numbers be 10 years from now or 20 years from now? 

Exactly. 

Then this story should have been on the front page of The New York Times, not on page A-6. 

I think that's true, but I think, you know, what we have to understand is just the epidemic is raging on and that people are still at risk, both here in the United States and around the world, and that we have to absolutely be vigilant in our prevention efforts and our research efforts to make sure that we contain and make an impact here and abroad. 

Now, the absence of vigilance is the fact that people engage in unsafe sexual practices. 

Sure. 

People use dirty needles. 

Sure. 

People do kinds of things-- 

Exactly. 

--because they think the danger has gone away. 

Exactly. And there's been a lot of that in response to the good news that we've had. I mean, people read the headlines and they don't read the text. People think that we have a cure and we don't. People think that the epidemic is slowing down and, in fact, it's not. So we want to make sure that after 16 years in this epidemic that the American public understands and that we all understand that the epidemic is still very much with us, that people are at risk and there's a significant shift in the epidemic in this country to women, to poor people, to people of color, to adolescents. 

Women? How so? 

Well, we have increasing numbers of women, more than 14 percent of all of the cases of HIV and AIDS in this country. 

Fourteen? 

Uh-huh-- are in women, and that's dramatically increasing every years. We see younger and younger people with HIV infection. Over half to the HIV infections in this country are in people under 25. So it means that the messages that we're giving to young people aren't getting where they need to go, so I think we need to take a good, hard look at how we're doing prevention, how we're educating our children, and make sure that they have the tools to keep themselves HIV-free. 

What kind of clean needle programs are you in favor of? 

Oh, dear! ~ That's a loaded question. Well, I think-- I think what I'm in favor of is, is making sure that we don't mix politics and public health, that we look at the studies that we have and that we follow the science on this issue. That's easier said than done. Obviously, this is a very sensitive issue for people. However-- 

Because they fear that it'll cause people to use needles to start taking drugs. 

Sure. Absolutely. But what we have to look at in this country is that between 30 and 50 percent of all people who are infected-- of all new infections are related either directly or indirectly to IV drug use and I think we have to have a little reality check here in our public health response to this epidemic, look at where the numbers are and then make our decisions about how to act. 

Other than numbers, what perception do you think we need to change, in terms of-- Dr. 

I think-- I think that the perception that Sandy just mentioned is a very crucial one. There's a general impression that AIDS is no longer a lethal disease and this is a false perception. It's true that we have drugs that are quite effective in controlling and prolonging-- controlling the virus and prolonging life. However, this should not result in complacency so that one lets his or her guard down and say, ''Well, I could catch this virus. Then I just need to take some pills and be rid of this problem.'' I think that's an impression that needs to be corrected. In addition, for our national leaders, complacency is also a problem. If they think this is a problem that's licked already in the U.S., it may not be a priority, yet the epidemic is raging on worldwide and that would be a tragedy because U.S. is the major contributor to research on this particular problem worldwide. Without the U.S. effort, we're not going to make that much progress. 

Do you think, David, that there will be a time in your life when you're not working on AIDS research? Dr. 

Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen. I think, given that we have 30 million cases or more today and that the new infection rates are continuing on like that, this will be with us for many generations to come, unfortunately. 

And so the mountain for you to climb will be so steep that you can't finish that journey in a lifetime. Dr. 

I don't think any one person is going to do this. This is going-- as you said earlier, this is a collective effort and we have to pass the baton on at some point. 

Thank you for joining us. Dr. 

Thank you. 

Great to see you. Great to meet you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you and much success-- 

It was nice to meet you. 

--with your work. 

Thanks. 

World AIDS Day-- Monday. Back in a moment.
