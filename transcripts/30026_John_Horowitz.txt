A.O. Scott:Good evening. I'm A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" filling in for Charlie Rose. The 89th Academy Awards will be held this Sunday in Los Angeles. Jimmy Kimmel will host the ceremony for first time. Damien Chazelle's musical, "La La Land," leads the pack with a record-tying 14 nominations. Barry Jenkins' coming of age drama, "Moonlight," and Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi film, "Arrival," follow with eight nominations apiece. And joining me now is David Edelstein, chief film critic for "New York Magazine," and vulture.com, and commentator for CBS Sunday morning. Aisha Harris, culture writer for "Slate" and host of the podcast "Represent;" and Josh Horowitz, MTV News correspondent and host of the podcast, "Happy, Sad, Confused." Very pleased to have them all at this table. And let's get right to it. So is it going to be a long night of "La La Land" sweeping through all the categories? And if so, why? 

John Horowitz:I think if you're a betting man, yes, it's 14 nominations. It's the one to go with. And as to why, I mean, it's a crowd pleaser. It's escapist entertainment as far as 2016 is concerned. As far as nine best picture nominees are concerned, it's the closest thing, I think, to a movie that lets you forget your troubles at least until a bittersweet ending. And enjoy a classical form done right. 

A.O. Scott:And yet, it seems to be a movie that in its wake is quite polarizing. One of the things that surprised me since it first kind of emerged through the festival circuit in the fall is how people seem to be fighting about this movie. It's weirdly divisive. One of the objections to this movie has come from kind of jazz fan corners who say it gets jazz wrong, and that there is kind of an unpleasant racial politics running underneath it. Also, among the other objections, are that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can't sing or dance. 

John Horowitz:That's fair. 

Aisha Harris:That's a huge part of why I didn't like the movie, is that when I go to a movie musical, I want to see you be either really good at dancing or really good at singing, but if you aren't good at both, then why I am going to see this movie musical? 

A.O. Scott:They're so good at being Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. 

Aisha Harris:When they're not singing and dancing. When they're not singing and dancing. 

David Edelstein:Actually, what would you want? I mean, I love Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady." I love a lot of people. I don't want to hear Marnie Nixon's voice anymore. The thing about Ryan Gosling, OK, I can carry a tune better than Ryan Gosling, but Ryan Gosling sounds inevitably Ryan Gosling-esque when he sings "City of Stars." And that is just an extension of his personality and it's very likable. I mean, he's not the great singer that Fred Astaire was or the great dancer, but -- and Emma Stone, I think, has a very sweet voice. It doesn't have a lot of fullness, but it's on key and it's her somehow, it gets -- And that's, I think, what the movie is about. It's not everybody sort of stops dead and does this, wow, Gene Kelly number. It's actually -- the singing and dancing are kind of extensions of their personality, as they are in "Umbrellas of Cherbourg," which was a huge inspiration for Damien Chazelle. 

Aisha Harris:I think one of the criticisms that I think has come up and that I agree with is the fact that the music -- and I think maybe it's the music's fault. The music is not as memorable or very good, I think. Astaire did not have that great a voice but he was singing Berlin, he was singing Gershwin, whereas the music here, to me, does not stick out, but nothing stuck with me with the exception of that piano trill. But the lyrics and the music itself, I just didn't find that great. 

Josh Horowitz:I don't know, I think they're ear worms. All five or six of them are stuck in my brain. And I think if anything, it's the irony we're talking about of "La La Land" is that it maybe plays least to musical aficionados because it's not full-throated singing, it's not 20 numbers. There's only six or seven songs in the film. It's a very non-traditional musical. And I think in some way that's why it's kind of transcended beyond just the musical theater crowd, and that's why it's resonated with a larger audience. 

A.O. Scott:I think there's something to that. I think it's also -- I mean, for me, it's really the last 30 minutes or so that kind of sold it to me, and made me kind of forgive some of its other lapses or flaws. And I think that has to do with movies, with a kind of an idea of what movies can do in a way that a film can tell a story of something that didn't happen with as much emotion or more, and conviction, than it tells the story of what did happen. And just that kind of idea and that openness to fantasy is, I think, something that maybe has been missing from a lot of Hollywood, and maybe why the Academy in particular is so willing -- so eager to anoint it and to anoint Damian Chazelle. 

David Edelstein:That's why -- that's why I liked when you said you checked yourself when you said it was an escapist film, and then you said, well, until the bittersweet ending. Actually, it's a fairly tough-minded movie about people who put ambition before, you know, I mean, these are star -- these people are meant to be together in the stars, and to demonstrate that, they go to a planetarium. And, you know, I mean, if -- there is no other more clear way to say these people are fated to be together. And yet, you know, Damien Chazelle is a very driven guy and he understands -- I mean, he gave his ex-wife now a producing credit on the movie, but they broke apart. I think he understands -- as the last film he made pointed out, that artists are often, you know, leaving, you know, the niceties of real life behind in order to perfect their craft. I think that's very much in the movie. 

A.O. Scott:That was "Whiplash," the story of the jazz -- 

David Edelstein:Let me say one more thing, his first film, "Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench," is a story of an interracial romance, and a wonderful black musician. And there are long-searching jazz solos in that movie that I think would surprise a lot of people from "La La Land," also very abrasive at times, and as well as a good old-fashioned song and dance number. So I think he's probably been blindsided by this sort of charge that he's kind of whitewashing jazz. 

Josh Horowitz:And I think just the broader issue we should remember about anything -- this is how we do pop culture now, right, we love something only to tear it down. And "La La Land" has been in the driver seat for so long, since its debut at the Venice Film Festival, that it was kind of inevitable that it would be picked apart in these ways and it's just kind of the cyclical nature. I mean, "Moonlight" maybe hasn't had those chinks in the armor, but I think if you're out front as long as "La La Land" is, you're subject to criticism. 

Aisha Harris:You also have to point out that the world has changed, or at least America has changed. The election happened. And I think some of that pushback is also coming because we don't want the Academy to sort of give in to this escapist nature. We want it to more effectively confront that through another movie winning as opposed to "La La Land." 

A.O. Scott:This year, it is an unusually, and for another adverb, I think refreshingly, diverse group of nominees. I mean, one of the questions that comes up is, is this a sign that the Academy or that Hollywood is changing, is making some progress, is this kind of one of those moments of illusory progress that we have so often? I mean, what do you make of that dimension of the politics? 

David Edelstein:Do you agree that there probably is going to be probably three out of the four major acting categories are going to have winners who are people of color? I hate that as much as everybody else, but non-whites let's say. 

Josh Horowitz:This will be the first time in the history of the Academy. 

David Edelstein:Yes. 

Aisha Harris:I'm not sure about Denzel if that's what you are referring to. 

A.O. Scott:Mahershala Ali seems to be a pretty good lock and Viola Davis. 

Aisha Harris:Yes. Denzel, I'm not so sure. I feel like Casey Affleck might sweep in and take that. 

David Edelstein:This is part of this whole Oscar politics thing, and this is racial, too. And I don't mean racial because Denzel Washington is African-American and Casey Affleck is white. I mean that, you know, one of the ways they prick the consciences of these liberal, you know, white liberal Academy members, in many cases, is the sort of whisper campaign about the sexual harassment charges against Casey Affleck that were admittedly settled out of court, versus how Nate Parker's, "The Birth of a Nation," was pretty much -- that whole debate played out in the "Hollywood Reporter" versus "Variety" instead of "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post" because its aim was to affect Oscar voters, either to sell the movie to Oscar voters or turn Oscar voters against it. So, you know, I mean, I think there may be people -- that might be enough in a season like this. And, again, it has nothing to do with such quaint notions as artistic merit, which we would all like to believe in. It has to do with politics. 

Josh Horowitz:Although, I think we can all agree, maybe "Birth of a Nation," also didn't have the stuff to necessarily be a worthy nominee. 

David Edelstein:It stunk, it stunk. 

Josh Horowitz:To put it delicately, I would agree. 

David Edelstein:It turned out to be overpraised at Sundance. 

Josh Horowitz:Yes, I think in terms of whether this is a watershed moment, is this the beginning of a new normal? It's honestly just too soon to say. Well, you know, this is, yes, this is progress. Is this the solution? No. I mean, it happens that there is some great films this year led by African-American actors, people of color, and that's great. But, I don't know, in some ways, I'm almost looking beyond the Academy. I'm looking at the blockbusters that are coming. That's almost more indicative to me of where the industry is headed. And allowing a Marvel film to come called "Black Panther," and to have a "Wonder Woman" film, have female-led franchises coming. That almost is more telling, I think, about where our culture is headed, and hopefully how the movie industry is reflecting society a little bit more. 

Aisha Harris:But then we have something like Ghost in a Shell" or "The Great Wall. 

Josh Horowitz:True. 

Aisha Harris:So it seems like it's moving a little bit, but then in other regards, particularly within the Asian American community, it doesn't seem like we have advanced nearly as much. 

David Edelstein:Let's get a little nutty here, too, and give credit where it's due. I think A.O. Scott at "The New York Times" has really pushed movies like "Moonlight" help to -- as much as we all loved it, I think you have been rather single-minded in getting us to see film -- getting the mainstream audience to see films by filmmakers of color. Let's not pretend that doesn't make a difference. It makes a difference with Oscar voters, makes a difference with the New York audiences, and, you know, that's sort of the elephant in the room. 

A.O. Scott:I am that elephant. (LAUGHTER) But I do want to talk about "Moonlight" because I do really have a very high regard for that movie, and great admiration for its director, Barry Jenkins. But I think also that, in that case, credit also should go to A24, the company that managed to take what is, in many ways, a challenging movie, not only because it's the story of a gay, black young man growing up in poverty, but also the way that it tells that story, the way that it uses the vocabulary of international art cinema to tell that story. The way that it doesn't follow a standard plot arc, and ends with this beautiful, delicate, quiet, intimate, I mean, it's the climactic moment in this movie is two guys drinking tea together, which is a pretty radical thing to get you an Oscar nomination. 

Aisha Harris:I think it's also radical in a sense that it is a movie about a gay character that still has hope underneath all the tragedy. I remember the first time I watched it, I kept wondering, what's going to happen like, is he going to survive? How terrible will this turn out to be for him, how tragic? And, in the end, it's not all easily solved, not everything is tied up in a nice bow, but there is some closure, and there is a ray of hope. And I think that for that to be a movie that is nominated as a movie about black people and about a gay character is really radical in its own way. 

David Edelstein:It's a sad movie, but it's enormously hopeful and do any of the other movies have happy endings? 

Josh Horowitz:On the spectrum of movies this year, it's the happiest movie we might have. 

Aisha Harris:"Hidden Figures" ends pretty well. (CROSSTALK) 

A.O. Scott:Let's talk about "Hidden Figures." "Hidden Figures" is the highest grossing of all the best picture nominees, having squeaked ahead of even "La La Land," and is, I think, a movie that has just kind of connected with audiences in a really wonderful way. It's a very conventional kind of movie. There is nothing radical about the form and the way it tells its stories and the way it sort of hits its beats and, yet, it also feels like its opening up new dimensions in stories that we might think we know or that we might have seen told in other ways in Hollywood movies. 

Josh Horowitz:We're talking about trends and watershed moments, that is, to have, you know, three African-American women fronting your movie that is not a genre film, that's not like, you know, a mass market comedy, that's just like a well-told, very down-the-middle, based on a true story, crowd pleaser, that is something that should be acknowledged as a good moment. Is it the best movie of the year? No, but it works on its own level and it works as well as it should work and the casting is impeccable, it's great to see -- we talked about "Moonlight" -- Janelle Monae killing it in two different movies this year. Octavia Spencer, the Academy loves her. 

A.O. Scott:Even before Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes, there's been this question and a lot of, I think, fake controversy about politics and Oscar speeches and do politics have any place in movie awards shows, and we have Jimmy Kimmel, a new host, a popular late-night host, who has to kind of walk this tight rope between not seeming like an utter coward, and also not, you know, alienating middle America. I mean, how do you foresee the night unfolding as a political event? 

Aisha Harris:I think with Kimmel as host, I'm a little concerned, just because I don't think that he is our most astute comedian, so handling this very delicate time period I think will be difficult. Obviously there will be writers writing for him, but I kind of wish, even though Chris Rock had his ups and downs last year, I wish it was Chris Rock hosting again this year instead of him. I wonder if we'll see a repeat of the 2003 Oscars which occurred a few days after we invaded Iraq, although I guess the difference there is that I think people are more divided in Hollywood then about what we did -- 

David Edelstein:It was only Michael Moore who stood up. 

Aisha Harris:Yeah, it was really just one -- I think there were a couple people who chose not to go. 

A.O. Scott:Billy Crystal was very careful. He walked on egg shells the whole time. But what about that documentary category? There are -- four of the five are very topical, very politically charged. "Fire At Sea," about the migrant crisis, the refugee crisis on a small island in Italy. Ava DuVernay's "13th," about mass incarceration. "O.J." Made in America," Ezra Edelman's epic kind of history of race and sports and masculinity and sexual violence and the court system and everything through the lens of that trial. And Raoul Peck's "I Am Not Your Negro," which brings James Baldwin back to life in a way, right in this moment, where he turns out to be the voice that many of us want to hear the most of. 

David Edelstein:It helps when you put his words underneath actual contemporary footage, too. I think that would walk away with it if it hadn't been for O.J.: Made in America. "O.J." Made in America" is such an epic, such a monumental work, the only thing that might give anyone in Hollywood pause is that it really is a made-for-television event? It has been screened theatrically, but simply the running time gives Ezra Edelman so many more resources, so many ways of building his story that somebody limited to 90 minutes or two hours, doesn't have. I would vote for "O.J." in a heartbeat, though I love all the nominees. 

Josh Horowitz:It's that category I think of the Oscars this year. I feel like those five have a place in the best picture category. I would put those up against any of the nine nominees. I would agree with you, "O.J." is the staggering achievement. I, myself, do agree with you, I mean, it feels a little bit false to put it in the film category, but whatever we call it, it is arguably the monumental pop culture work of 2016. You ran through the laundry list of the issues it deals with and that's thanks to an amazingly long running time, but also like an exceptional filmmaker like Ezra Edelman. 

David Edelstein:And a great companion piece to Jeffery Toobin, who is filling in for Charlie, his book was the basis of the other monumental O.J. work, which looked at it much from a courtroom personality drama. 

Aisha Harris:You made a good point, though, Ezra had seven and a half hours to tell this story, and I'm just now thinking about it, and I had the pleasure of interviewing Raoul Peck for my podcast, and he told me he worked on this for ten years, like he worked a decade on a movie that is 90 minutes long, and this feat that he pulled off of putting all of these different passages from Baldwin together, then having Samuel Jackson not sound like Samuel Jackson also reading the words. 

Josh Horowitz:He didn't really sound like Baldwin either. 

Aisha Harris:No, he didn't but I think that was fine. 

A.O. Scott:But there is a kind of density there, I mean, you do, after 90 minutes, you feel like you read six books. It's an incredible feeling. 

David Edelstein:Let's just say, it's a great movie, it's out now, everybody should see it. 

A.O. Scott:Amen. Can we do a lightning round of, any surprises? I mean, we're sort of looking at it as if "La La Land" is a done deal in most of the categories. Is there some category where you think, you know, there might be an upset or a shock? 

David Edelstein:Well, Hollywood loves Tony Erdman. I love Tony Erdman. It's a delightful, going to be remade by Americans, comedy about an overbearing dad and his trying to get his daughter to laugh again and have a sense of humor and a social conscience. 

A.O. Scott:Something you and I can maybe both relate to. 

David Edelstein:However, what's happened with "Salesman," you know, might tip the balance. I think "Salesman" is a great movie, too. It's sort of an embarrassment of riches this year. That is why the Oscars are so heartbreaking. You don't want to see people kicked off the island. You want them all to sort of gather together and hug. I do, anyway. 

A.O. Scott:Such a bleeding heart liberal. 

David Edelstein:Unless "A Man Called Ove" takes it. 

A.O. Scott:Sleeper pick right there. 

Josh Horowitz:I would go with all the frontrunners, honestly. That being said, I never get my Oscar pool right despite being invited to this table. Supporting actors, I mean, last year, Mark Rylance did no publicity for "Bridge of Spies." Sly Stallone was supposed to get up there and accept that award. Mahershala Ali is clearly the favorite, but Dev Patel has all the muscle of the Weinsteins and "Lion." You never know. The greatest living actor on the planet is Michael Shannon in that category. For my money, I love that man and he can do no wrong. So I think that's a place to maybe look for an unlikely upset. 

Aisha Harris:I think that Emma Stone is probably going to win, but I can maybe see Natalie Portman sneaking in there, even though "Jackie" has kind of faded and that movie really is just about her and the movie itself is not that great. 

A.O. Scott:I'm feeling Isabelle Huppert in there. 

Aisha Harris:That could happen, too. 

David Edelstein:Seriously? 

Aisha Harris:I think maybe. 

David Edelstein:Can I just say, let me just say it again, I can think of so few of the nominees this year who I would not want to win, and in the past, you know, I get a bee in my bonnet about somebody, but this year it just makes me want to cry when I think about those actresses, and Annette Bening who gave my favorite performance of the year who was, you know, so, you know, cruelly ridiculously for 20th century women. As well as Amy Adams in "Arrival" which was a spectacular performance and she was also very good in that lousy "Nocturnal Animals" movie, too, which Shannon is so great in. But I think this is what's horrible about the Oscars. These people are all, this year, wonderful. I don't want anybody to -- (LAUGHTER AND CROSSTALK) -- they won't be. They're going to go home and go into the fetal position and cry for a few days. 

Aisha Harris:They'll cry into their millions of dollars. 

A.O. Scott:We have been grateful to have seen so much good work. You're ending this on a wonderful and unexpected note of optimism, as you said about "Moonlight." There is hope. We will go on. And the Oscars will be broadcast on ABC on Sunday night. It has been such a great pleasure talking with all of you. Aisha Harris, Josh Horowitz, David Edelstein, thank you so much.
