The debate surrounding the future of American healthcare took another contentious turn on Tuesday. President Trump addressed a group of undecided House Republicans in a closed door meeting and strongly implored them to follow through on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. This comes on the heels of revisions meant to win over conservatives, including a shift of Medicaid cost, from counties to the state government. Beginning even with the changes, passage of the House bill remains far from assured with rank-and-file members still in opposition. To understand all of this, we turn to Washington and Al Hunt of "Bloomberg View" and Robert Costa of "The Washington Post." Thank you both for coming. Bob, you have written about this in a piece for tomorrow. Tell me where it is, tell me what impact the president had, and are all the cards, in terms of threats and promises, in his hand? 

After months of the president focusing on executive orders and settling into the presidency, this is his first major legislative test. I just stepped over here from the Capitol and I was meeting all day with senators and congressmen. And they told me that the president has plunged into these discussions, having meetings today, Tuesday, at the White House, coming to the Capitol to make a final plea to skittish House Republicans to pass this bill, pass Speaker Ryan's bill on Thursday as planned. He wants a victory, more than any detail in this bill, he wants a win. 

But he also has to address some of the issues that are politics to him in terms of what it does for his core supporters. 

Exactly right. And a lot of people privately within the Trump White House are a little bit uneasy about how health care is now leading the president's agenda. They worry about how this affects his core base, those people in rural states, blue-collar areas of the country, some of them on Medicaid assistance. His House Republican plan phases out much of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and you see Republicans like Senator Boozman and Cotton of Arkansas, and others from states that have poorer populations really wondering if this is the right thing, in particular, from a president who ran on fiery populism and not touching entitlements in the same way that Speaker Ryan has long advocated. 

Al, what does this vote mean for the president? 

Well, a loss, a defeat would be a disaster. I think a victory would be really bad politically but a defeat would be much worse, Charlie. They have to do something because failure is just not an option. I think if it were held right now -- and Bob's been up at the Capitol, I've just been talking to people by phone -- my guess is it might not pass right now, but it will pass by Thursday night or whenever they hold the vote. But they've done it with a bunch of necessary gimmicks. The president I think has been a very effective lobbyist. You mentioned the Medicaid in New York State, that was a special gimmick for New York state. They said that, you know, Medicaid would have a work requirement. I assume that doesn't apply to nursing homes, Charlie, so you and I will be okay eventually. And there are other gimmicks in here, but my favorite gimmick was, on the tax credits, they instruct the Senate to do this. Now, I've covered the Senate for a long time. They usually don't take terribly well to instructions coming from the other body. So I think they will achieve what is absolutely a baseline essential for them, to get it through the House, it will move through the Senate. They may even ultimately, with Mitch McConnell's dealmaking talents, be able to get a deal through the Senate, and with Trump's lobbying. In the long run, I think this is going to be a loser because Bob Teeter, the great pollster, one of the three greatest I've ever known, the late Robert Teeter, Republican, told me 20 years ago, whichever party owns health care, it will be a political loser. The Democrats have found that out and I think the Republicans are about to find that out. 

Bob, do you agree with what Al just said in terms of it probably wouldn't pass today but by Thursday it will pass? 

As of Tuesday evening, based in my own whip count at the Capitol and talking to top House leadership aides, there are probably between 20 and 30 hard-nosed, which means the bill as of right now would likely fail if it was brought to the House floor. But Speaker Ryan, his aides tell me and his friends tell me that he wants to bring it to the floor. He believes the Republican Party since the Obama era has talked about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act and they have to move politically on this. This is why he wanted to move it first. They're making the case to members that if you don't vote on this now, you disrupt all plans for tax reform because much of this first bill is a reconciliation bill, meaning it deals with taxes and gutting some of the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act. 

Do you believe, as some have suggested, that he should have done tax reform first and then health care? 

Well, if you look at some of the president's allies, people like pundit Laura Ingraham and Chris Ruddy, his friend who he hangs out with at Mar-a-Lago, the more populist at the party say Trump should have started with infrastructure and taxes and job creation, and going along with Speaker Ryan moves him in an ideological direction that wasn't part of why he won last year. 

So the president's argument seems to be a threat in part now, you know, he threatened the head of the Freedom Caucus and I'm not sure what the reporting is about that, if it's a closed session. Go ahead, you can tell me. 

Real quick. When the president visited the Capitol Tuesday morning, he had an exchange with Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, and he said, we may go after you, and he said it in a joking way, but a lot of people in the room told me that they saw it as kind of a veiled threat. Trump likes to keep the House GOP on edge. He may not go after them. He may not be angling to have primary challenges. He wants them to know that he's an unpredictable president and he needs a win. And if he has a threat out there, even if it's in a chuckle, he wants it still to be out there. 

Al, is he the kind of president that can say to them, I need you on this, you have to help me on this, everything is at stake? 

Well, he's certainly done a better job than some feared he would do. As Bob said earlier, this is his first real legislative test and he's really been passionate about it. I think you have to give him credit for being effective. I think the other reason that they wanted to bring this up first was because some Republicans worry about whether his popularity, his currency will be as great in a couple of months as it is right now among the Republican base. So get it, get it done now. I think the threat to run a primary against Mark Meadows is really an idle one. I cannot imagine a conservative member who voted against this bill because he thought it didn't repeal Obamacare sufficiently, or it was Obamacare 2.0, is going to face a threat from the right. But I think in those people who are undecided, in many of those Republican districts, Trump remains very popular. His overall ratings are down, but he remains very popular. I would finally just agree with Bob Costa, agree with some other critics, I would imagine that Steve Bannon is not happy with this sequencing because not only is this going to take some time, this isn't going to happen in the matter of the next month or so. The Senate is gonna still be involved. It will tie up the House to a limited extent. And it looks like infrastructure is off 'til next year. 

Tom Cotton suggested that you should not vote for this bill because it could not pass the Senate, and therefore, you would have done damage to your own political future. Bob Costa, is he right about that? 

I spoke to Senator Cotton today. He has many reservations. He thinks this whole process is moving too quickly. He thinks Speaker Ryan is trying to do all these different things and not thinking enough about the Senate. Trump has bought in, for now, into Ryan's argument that you have to move on health care now. But it was so revealing, Charlie, to watch the president in Louisville last night where he said I can't wait to move on to trade and other issues. The president's invested in getting this passed, but he's not deeply interested in the health care issue from what I'm told from the discussions at the Oval Office he's having with members, and from Capitol Hill. And you're right, the Senate, a lot of these Senate Republicans, they're more moderate than the House, the Senate generally is more moderate. And they're gonna take their time. Senator Murkowski, for instance, of Alaska, she told me she hasn't even been courted by the White House so she thinks this process could take months. 

Charlie, here's the point that Tom Cotton raised a week or so ago. He drew a parallel to 1993 when the House passed a big Clinton budget bill. And they voted for something called the BTU tax. It got to the Senate and the Senate of course killed it right away, but some of those House Democrats paid a price in the next election for voting for that unpopular tax. And that's the fear that some of these -- I mean, the idea of the Senate will take care of it and ultimately will work the whole thing out. They're going to be voting for some stuff that could come back to haunt them. 

Where, Al, are the democrats on this? 

Oh, they're opposed. This is easy. They have problems on something like the Gorsuch nomination. But on this one, you know, it's very easy. The three states that have had the biggest drop in uninsured over the last three or four years are West Virginia, Arkansas, and Kentucky, the heart of Trump country. This is a bill, as Bob alluded to earlier, is not good for the Trump base. And so I don't think that Joe Manchin will have any trouble opposing this bill as it now stands. 

Turning to the budget. I'll come back to health care. I mean, there are some of the issues that raise similar questions in health care, which is, the people who are suffering the most from the budget are people who were part of the core constituency of candidate Trump. Yes? 

I can't quite figure out, and maybe Bob can help me, what Mick Mulvaney and Donald Trump have in common. I just don't -- this does not look to me, from what we've seen, the outlines, not a full budget, it really doesn't look like much of a Donald Trump budget. I mean, higher defense and more on immigration enforcement, to be sure, but some of the other cuts, I can't believe that the Bannon wing, if you will, of the White House, they're crazy about. 

I think the Bannon wing and Steve Bannon has spoken about this, the deconstruction of the administrative state, that famous phrase he has used. He is talking about the upper layers of spending in a lot of these agencies and departments. And so as the White House looks at its agenda, which is to raise military spending by $54 billion, they've got to find a way to offset that, and they're taking the ax to the State Department, to HUD, to the EPA, to everything. 

Are they doing it because of ideology or because they need to take, you know, they need to deal with the $54 billion increase in defense spending? Or do these two issues simply come together at this time? 

It's a reflection of what they want to do politically. Most people in Washington, in the White House, in the Capitol, they do not believe the Trump budget will pass or will have support within the congressional ranks -- 

And that includes Republicans. 

That includes the congressional majorities. They see the budget as a statement, a statement of Bannonism, of Trumpism, of how they want to rattle Washington. 

There was an article in your paper over the weekend suggesting that the factions that were at play in the Trump -- 

That was my story. 

That was your story? 

Sure. 

A very good story all of us were talking about. What's been the reaction from the White House on the story suggesting there were factions and laying out -- there was the New Yorkers and then there was the Bannonites. 

What do you think, Charlie? (LAUGHTER) 

Well, but they're not calling me up to say did you see what Robert Costa wrote? They're calling you up and saying, why did you write this? 

I feel like, during the course of my reporting with my colleague Phil Rucker, it was almost like pulling off a scab. This was the dynamic that has upended the Trump White House. So long, for the first few months of this presidency, we've been talking about Bannon versus Reince Priebus, the Chief of Staff. Forget about that conventional wisdom. The real players right now, the competing players, Gary Cohn, former Goldman Sachs president; Dina Powell, former executive at Goldman Sachs; close friends, working with Ivanka Trump, Trump's daughter; and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law, also Senior Advisor. They're polished, they're worldly, they're connected to the Wall Street community, they're seen as a different type of operative within the White House, because of their business backgrounds, about -- and they are moderate when it comes to politics, and because of their rising power and they have the president's ear -- Bannon and Priebus are now aligned. Any kind of division has kind of faded away as they see Powell and Cohen as real rivals. 

Al, what did you think of the piece, in terms of what it said, not in terms of anything else? 

I thought it was a terrific piece that really captured a part that hadn't occurred to a lot of us in Washington. I don't know Mr. Bannon, Bob does. But I think it's always a mistake to underestimate him for the simple reason he has a world view. He really has a world view. Now some of us may think it's pretty dark, but it's a view that certainly was attractive to Donald Trump in the campaign, and when the crunch gets on, if there are problems, failures, if things go south, I have at least a suspicion that Mr. Bannon may be more persuasive in that environment than Gary Cohn. 

The question is not whether he is more persuasive than Gary Cohn. The question is, is he more persuasive than Jared Kushner? 

Again, let me yield to Bob, but it's funny because when I read stories sometimes about Bannon, I see Jared Kushner is on Bannon's side, and then when I read stories about the other side, I see Jared Kushner is on that side. Jared Kushner has managed to get pretty good press, and from what I can tell -- maybe it's because he is the president's son-in-law -- he hasn't really deeply offended either side, but again, let me defer to Bob. 

Maybe it's because he's a shrewd political end player. 

He is. He is a cagey player inside of the White House, speaking of Kushner. We got this scene in the story, Charlie, which I thought was so telling, I heard it from multiple people inside of the White House, that Kushner almost acts as a psychologist for these two warring factions -- the New Yorkers and the populist Republican types. He brings them to the couch in his office throughout the day as they complain about the others, and he tries to mediate. And this is Kushner's role, he's someone who stays out of the press, is talking to his father-in-law constantly, and has worked closely with Bannon, but also really sees Dina Powell and Gary Cohn in a favorable way. 

What about other members of this administration, what about the Secretary of Defense, what about the Secretary of State, what about Mnuchin at Treasury, what about some of the people who are his deputy finance secretary, or deputy secretary of the treasury? These people, some of them, seem to have served in other governments, like Bush 43. 

That is true. I think the cabinet, in general, all these members, these cabinet officials are trying to build a rapport with the president because with this president, a personal relationship is so critical. And that's what Tillerson is trying to do, he is talking to the president almost every day, I'm told. He is in close touch with Jared Kushner, who in effect is a shadow of Secretary of State, in the way he meets with so many diplomats. You've got Defense Secretary Mattis, he has a lot of respect from the president, still trying to build that personal relationship. Mnuchin and Sessions -- the Attorney General -- they probably have the closest relationship with the president, because of their work on the campaign. 

I think the Secretary of State has had just a horrible week, I mean, even -- at least since he's come back from Asia. I cannot understand how, after the, what many consider the insult of Angela Merkel when she was here, why he is not going to a NATO meeting. It is just simply inexplicable at this time. Among other things that are inexplicable about Rex Tillerson. 

Wait a minute. Let me just understand this, Bob, and you can help me understand this, where is he going to be during the NATO Meeting? 

I can't figure out where he is going. At some point, he is going to Russia. I'm not sure it's at the same time. But wherever he is going, it seems to me it's hard to make a case that it's a more important priority than the NATO Meeting given the current climate. 

And we wish we could ask questions, Charlie. Covering the State Department is like a black box. He brought one reporter on his trip to Asia and he is not really communicating with the press at all since becoming Secretary of State. 

And shows no inclination that he feels it necessary -- not only the inclination, but he doesn't feel like it's necessary for him at this time. 

It's somewhat stunning. I mean, Secretary of State is such a high profile position in the cabinet and to have so little interest in communicating a message and talking with reporters, it's unusual. 

What's the evaluation of the job he did on his most recent trip to Asia? 

There's a lot of chatter inside of the White House about possible action against North Korea, about how to handle North Korea as it becomes more bellicose in its weapons development -- 

These are things he said. 

That is true, that Rex Tillerson talked about, but he hasn't been out there in a full way. 

And I think, Charlie, substantively, the most important thing, and I don't think we have a real fix on this yet, is what were his meetings like in Beijing? What really happened? Did they make any progress there, on North Korea or on other matters? Usually, when you go and spend some time with the Chinese, it takes a while before the real story emerges. 

Well, as your friend Jim Baker said to me, if you're Secretary of State, you want to make damn sure you have a very good relationship with the president. 

Yes, exactly. 

He certainly did. (LAUGHTER) 

Thank you both. It is a pleasure to hear. This has been labeled a great big week in Washington. We have a confirmation of a Supreme Court justice. We have a testimony of an FBI Director in Congress. And we have a vote on the replacement of Obamacare. So if you're a political junkie, this has been one heck of a week. 

It's only Tuesday. 

Or a journalist. It's only Tuesday, as we were reminded. Thank you for joining us. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Thank you. 

We'll be right back. Stay with us.
