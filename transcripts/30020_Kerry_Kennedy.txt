Charlie Rose:Welcome to our broadcast. Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for the presidency began 25 years ago in Washington D.C. on March 16. Tonight on our program: a consideration of the Kennedy vision and the link to the Clinton presidency and the future of that vision over the next few years. Also this evening, John Turtorro. He is the actor who two years ago won his award for the Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Last year, he won for the Best New Director. He'll be here to talk about his new film inspired by his father. And Marcus Roberts, the brilliant jazz pianist who also mastered the stride piano, will be here to talk about his music. We begin with the legacy of Robert F. Kennedy. President Clinton campaigned on the theme of hope and promises reminiscent of the presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy. Joining me to talk about Kennedy's legacy and its role in America's future are Robert Kennedy's daughter Kerry Kennedy Cuomo; Jack Newfield, columnist for the New York Post; Peter Edelman, a former aide to Robert Kennedy; and Alan Brinkley, a post-World War II historian. Welcome, thank you all for coming. Kerry, reflect please as you have before in print, how you see the legacy of your father? 

Kerry Kennedy:I think if you look back at the '68 campaign, there were certain themes which he was espousing at that time, which are very, very important today. It's really central to the American agenda today. One thing is that he spoke about the riots around the country. Washington had burned. Detroit had burned. Watts had burned. Today, we're waiting with bated breath for the verdict in the trial, the second Rodney King trial. He used his campaign to bring reporters and bring America to the impoverished parts of our country. To the Mississippi Delta, to Appalachia, to Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, to Delano with Cesar Chavez. Today, if you go back to any of those places, you see that that poverty still exists and that economics and social justice is still really a dream for so much of our country. 

Charlie Rose:Let me get Peter in and reflect on some of those same themes, so well said. Take us inside the campaign as one of two or three principal aides to the moment of 1968 and how the vision America articulated. And whether you think, because you're in Washington and because you're teaching a Jewish town and because you know a lot of what President Clinton's standing for, is there a connection between that campaign, that candidate and the candidate of 1992 who now lives in the White House? 

Peter Edelman:I think there's a really very close connection, Charlie. The country was deeply divided in 1968. Of course, we were fighting a war in Vietnam, and we don't have that kind of thing ripping us apart today. But we've really had 12 years of government that hasn't responded to our needs, the needs of our people. Robert Kennedy was really, I'd say, kind of our first post-liberal politician, to use a label. He hated labels. He wouldn't have liked being called a liberal or not a liberal. But he was really trying to find -- He was so determined to get things done to try to help people be less poor. I remember we went to see Secretary of Agriculture Freeman after we'd been down in Mississippi and seen that hunger down there. And he said, "I don't know why you just can't get the food down there." So that there was this determination to get things done and there was this determination to get past big government, to get past old ways of things. And I think that's very similar to the way Bill Clinton is approaching the presidency now. It's just kind of a shame that we've had to wait 24 years to get back to that agenda and get back to kind of new ways at looking at things. 

Charlie Rose:Jack, President Clinton in a visit here in New York met you and said that your book, a biography and a memoir of Robert F. Kennedy had changed his life because he read it while a student at Oxford. What might have been in that book and in that life that would have changed Bill Clinton's life? 

Jack Newfield:I think one of the great things about Robert Kennedy and also about some of the other leaders of the 60s is how much they changed themselves internally while they were changing America and the world. And the capacity of growth and to be changed by raw emotional experience I think was one major message that I try to convey in my book where I called Robert Kennedy an "existential politician" who changed himself through experience as he was changing the country. 

Charlie Rose:Many have said that one of his best qualities was the fact that there was a constant growth in terms of his own experience impacting on how he saw the world and what he wanted to do with his own life. 

Jack Newfield:I don't know yet if President Clinton has that capacity. A lot of what President Clinton's done has impressed me so far. But I don't think Robert Kennedy would have done what he's doing about Haiti. I don't think Robert Kennedy would have let the electoral votes of Florida outweigh the claims of human liberty and continue the Bush policy. I think that is one area, human rights, where I think Clinton is still falling short where I think Robert Kennedy would have led the country if he had ever had the opportunity to test his ideas in power. 

Charlie Rose:Alan, there's a historian among us. Put Robert Kennedy's, that campaign, and in a sense the ideas that he was articulating in some sense of perspective. I know people who view Robert Kennedy as someone who would have been a significant transition figure in American politics because of where he had been and because of the service as Attorney-General and because he'd been a campaign manager. Because he knew that old Democratic Party but also was leading the Democratic Party somewhere else and wanted to be the bridge between two Americas. That we lost something there. What is the historical judgment, which has to be limited in a sense because of the campaign so tragically cut short? 

Alan Brinkley:Well, I think he was a transitional figure in the history of the Democratic Party despite the brevity of his leadership in the Democratic Party. Robert Kennedy, like Bill Clinton, was a figure of his time. He was a transition figure both for the image of the Kennedy family and its legacy in American life and also for the Democratic Party. It's Robert Kennedy who brought into the mainstream of Democratic politics a whole host of issues that we now associate with the 60s but John Kennedy's presidency only very cautiously approached. He made a much more forceful commitment to economic action to deal with racial problems than the administration of his brother was ever called upon to make. He began to bring other minorities into the scope of American politics in a way that had never occurred to most liberals to do five years earlier. To whatever degree Americans associate both the Kennedy family and the so-called left wing of the Democratic Party with its association with the so-called underclass and with a whole range of ethnic and racial minorities and other groups who have been left out of the American life, it's really Robert Kennedy much more than John Kennedy who introduced that into the Party's agenda. And that has had costs for the Democratic Party as well as benefits. 

Charlie Rose:Where do the realities, and I throw this to all of you, the realities of 1993 clash with the promise of 1968. 

Peter Edelman:The realities of 1993 are that we are many ways where we left off in 1968. 

Charlie Rose:So we've lost 25 years. 

Peter Edelman:In many ways we've lost 25 years of making progress on issues that divide our country, issues of very deep human need. And on top of that, because of what's happened to the accumulated data over the last 12 years, we're in a very deep hole in terms of our economy that's worse than what we faced in 1968. So it's a kind of even tougher thing to dig out of. One thing I wanted to say about Alan's comment is that Robert Kennedy had something in his politics that we lost in the interim time, I think, which was a bridging quality. That is to say he was, of course, a kind of a tribune for the powerless and someone who with whom people who had nothing could identify, and he really did want to get something done for them. But at the same time, partly because he was Irish-Catholic, because he was the President's brother, because he was himself, and because he identified with everybody who was in a position of not being on top, which means really people who are in the middle. He was really a bridging figure and we haven't had that in our politics. 

Charlie Rose:Okay, go ahead. What made him- what brought him to that notion of being connected to feeling, the experiencing this identity with the left privilege? 

Jack Newfield:I think he had almost a poet's or a novelist's sensibility, the ability to get inside your skin and inside your life. You'd want to know what it was like to be you almost in a poetic way rather than in a 6-point program way. 

Charlie Rose:And would you have seen that in the Attorney General of the United States in 1961? 

Jack Newfield:I didn't because I was active in a civil rights movement and I was bigotting him. 

Charlie Rose:Right, and that's my point. Peter, would you have seen that in '61? 

Peter Edelman:Well, I've always disagreed with Jack about that. I think the changes in Robert Kennedy were continuum and not a bad Bobby in a good Bobby, which is- maybe I'm caricaturing a little, Jack, about your book, but I've always thought, you know, he had grown up as the seventh child in a large family, he has always identified as the underdog. Look at who his friends were at Harvard, look at- he joined the Navy as a seaman, he had always had a connection with really ordinary people in a very instinctive way. 

Kerry Kennedy:I'd go back also and look at his life, it's not that he's suddenly found some sort of great change in 1967 or 1968. Back in the '50s he was using- he was prosecuting corrupt Union bosses and putting people like Jimmy Hoffa, who are ripping off the rank and file, into jail. As Attorney General he is the power of the Justice Department to ensure the vote for disenfranchised blacks in the south. Those are again people who were powerless, whose side he came to be on. And in 1966, when most Americans hadn't even heard of appartheid, Robert Kennedy was in South Africa talking about racism. So I think that this was something that was very much a part of his soul throughout his entire life. Certainly, as one of his children, he brought that vision and belief home to us as well. 

Peter Edelman:I certainly agree with that. I don't want to be misunderstood at this point. My view is that while he was campaign manager for President Kennedy in 16 Attorney General, I think to some degree his objectives were made subordinate to President Kennedy's objectives. And even as Attorney General he had to balance the power of Senate eastland, the power of other Kennedy (inaudible) against what he wanted to do. I think after President Kennedy was assassinated, for the first time at 38 he had to figure out where his own priorities, and I think that began his incredible growth spurt from '63 to '68. 

Alan Brinkley:I think you also have to remember he was a politician operating within the context of a particular political moment and whatever his personal beliefs, and I certainly don't doubt the sincerity of his beliefs, the politics of 1968 were very different than the politics of 1960 or 1964. The racial climate had become disastrously violent and rather suddenly there was enormous division on other issues. And so there was beginning to be a constituency for certain kinds of positions that for which there had not been any visible constituency a few years earlier. In addition to that, Robert Kennedy was running for President in 1968 and he was running until the end of his life, not against a Republican, but against Lyndon Johnson. And so he had to position himself within the Democratic Party, and later against Hubert Humphrey, he had to position himself within the Democratic Party in a way that would differentiate himself from the people against whom he was running and the only place to move was to the left. That's not to question his motives, it's just to say he was, in addition to everything else he was, a politician and a good one. 

Jack Newfield:I think part of his strength, at least for me, was how much he educated '60s radicals like me about organized crime for example, which I had never really thought about. I think he was the greatest Attorney General in history, the only Attorney General in history who put the power of the national government into the war against breaking up organized crime. Nobody before or since has done that. He opened the eyes of people like me to the nefarious influence of organized crime, of the (inaudible) Union, which is- and I think there is a consistency in his thinking and I think that's why he's such a bridging figure because he did not, I think, really compromise the- which I this was some conservative elements in his thinking in '68. I think he used those as an anchor to build a broader coalition. And I think one way he differs from Clinton is that Robert Kennedy was able to create this coalition of very poor Blacks, Latinos, and Indians with working class Whites, whereas I think Clinton's coalition was more with suburban constituents. 

Charlie Rose:Some of the same working class whites who went over and became Reagan Democrats, in fact. 

Jack Newfield:-- in '68. 

Charlie Rose:Wallace first, and then Reagan formed the basis of Reagan Democrats, which gave Reagan the margin to be elected. 

Jack Newfield:Cause I think he was consistently willing to tell different audiences what the didn't want to hear. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Interesting thing about (inaudible) is we look at the agenda for the country. And I want to talk about the (inaudible). We look at the agenda for the country. Clearly, there he is as the President faces the economic demands and parodies and the economic plan that there is this commitment to and seemingly a connection to children, nutrition, and other health and welfare issues, which seem to make a direct connection. Part of this is because Mrs. Clinton, because of her influence in serving on the board of the Children's Defense fund run by Marian Wright Edelman, your wife. On the other hand, there seems to be a change in the politics now that in 1992, in 1993, we're talking about welfare reform, we're talking about a different set of considerations on the domestic front. And I wonder, as we think about this connection, whether this is a- that Robert Kennedy would have been a different person in 1993 and if he looked at this and would be making the same kinds of choices perhaps. 

Peter Edelman:Well I think that the thing that would be, in terms of what President Clinton is doing about people who have less, the thing that would be similar is a genuine commitment to looking at, and here I take back a word that the Republics sort of stole from us, empowerment, making people able to be self-sufficient, making them be part of a community. I think that's an element in Bill Clinton's politics that was also very much in Robert Kennedy's politics. So you have that parallel between the two times. And the other thing that I think about Bill Clinton is that if you look at that budget that he's put together, it would have been pretty easy based on the campaign and based on what our national needs are to say we're going to do cutting the spending, and some revenue raising, and everything else is going to have to wait. 

Charlie Rose:That's where the push is right now in the Congresses, to increase their spending. 

Peter Edelman:Their pushing back on that, on the spending cuts. But if you look at that budget, the fact is that in a less publicized way it also makes- although he talks about investments, so I shouldn't say less publicized, it makes a start, a very, very serious start on helping people make it in this society, and that's another piece of connection back to Robert Kennedy. 

Charlie Rose:Go ahead, Alan. 

Alan Brinkley:I think there's another aspect though that is a big difference between, not necessarily between Clinton and Robert Kennedy as people, but between circumstances they inherit, which is of course the economy. In 1992 and 1993 the economy is the single most important issue on Clinton's agenda and probably on the agenda of most Americans. In 1968 it was hardly on the map, no one envisioned the kinds of economic problems that we now encounter. Obviously, the individuals had economic problems, but the health of the national economy was largely unquestioned, as it had been, for the most part, since the end of World War II. And that's a dramatic difference. Robert Kennedy, if he were alive today and were a politician today would have to deal with a set of tough economic problems and choices that it didn't seem that we faced in 1968, although in fact, we now know we did. 

Charlie Rose:It's also fair to say that our vision that he articulated in terms of the commitment to the poor and the underprivileged, and this has been touched on by all of you, is now, sort of seems to be, where the left is, within the realm of the Democratic Party. Now where Bill Clinton is, we don't seem to know yet. You know some Republicans say, you know, he talks right and moves left. Democrats are saying that he is mainstream Democrat and others are saying that this is a quote, "new Democrat." 

Peter Edelman:I think that's the closest Charlie. It's very hard to put a label on Bill Clinton. Because he's really somebody who is kinda looking at, how do you get from here to there? And so, if you look at some areas, it looks conservative. Other areas it looks liberal. And I think that's the key to the whole thing and again, that's a parallel. 

Charlie Rose:Here's one last point I want to make, just cause I -- it is that what's important it seems to me about Washington today, as I talk to people about what's going on, is this clear sense, unlike the past 12 years, of using government as an agent of change, a commitment to use government in a way and that government had a noble purpose. Seems to be reflected in these two people of very separate backgrounds, one southern, one northeastern. With a whole -- one, born to very poor circumstances, other very wealthy circumstances. The other one became a road scholar, worked his way and the other, through a series of political and personal experiences, but they both seem to find themselves in this commitment to make government and give it a significant role, in change in the lives of people. 

Kerry Kennedy:I'd just like to say also, one of the greatest things that Robert Kennedy did, was he told audiences wherever he went, that it was up to them to get involved and to make a difference and I think that's something that Clinton has been saying. But if there's anything that we can walk away from this with, it would be that -- 

Charlie Rose:That you, an individual can make a difference. 

Kerry Kennedy:Yeah and that we are all obligated to try. Before we leave, I'd just like to invite everybody who's watching to a mass we're going to have in Robert Kennedy's honor on June 6th, -- 

Charlie Rose:At Arlington Cemetery. 

Kerry Kennedy:At Arlington Cemetery in Washington. 

Charlie Rose:Thank you very much Kerry. Last point Jack? 

Jack Newfield:I think what they do have in common is the desire to marry the power of government to individual responsibility. And individual responsibility was a big part of Robert Kennedy's message, going back to the Bed-Stuy Restoration Project and the way he talked about service and idealism. 

Charlie Rose:Thank you all. Thank you Alan, thank you Jack, thank you Peter, thank you Kerry. 

Kerry Kennedy:Thank you. 

Charlie Rose:We'll be right back. John Turturro's here and we will talk about Mack, what is in a sense, a film inspired by his father. One of my favorite musicians in the entire world, Marcus Roberts. We'll be right back. John Turturro has acted in some of today's most memorable films. Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," and "Jungle Fever" and "Mo Betta Blues," as well as the lead in the Coen Brothers' "Barton Fink," where he received the Cannes Best Actor Award of 1991. His latest film, which he spent the last 12 years trying to get made, is his own. "Mac" tells the story of an immigrant carpenter trying to start a business of his own with his two brothers. Joining me now to talk about it is John Turturro and I'm very pleased to have him here. Welcome. 

John Turturro:It's nice to be here. 

Charlie Rose:Oh it's nice to have you here. I said twelve years, tell me when you wanted to make this, when somehow this idea came to you and you said, there is something I want to do. Either as a play, or as a film, but the idea of doing something, in which the theme of the film, came from the inspiration of your father. Inspiration rather than, this is a film about your father's life. 

John Turturro:Right. Well I guess it was while I was working with him and working in that milieu. I had never really seen that portrayed on the screen. It's a very physical world. It's a world where people are struggling against all different elements, sometimes themselves or people they work with. I always viewed it from afar in a way I thought could be very interesting. It started to germinate and then in 1980, I started to put things down in screenplay form and then with my partner Brandon Cole, who's a playwright, we turned it into a play and then proceeded to do it three different times, over a period of five years and then in 1987, I finally put together the first draft. 

Charlie Rose:And then after the success -- after you won, the Best Actor Award at Caan for Barton Fink, did that give you, give it, the capacity for you to do it then because you could raise the money or whatever you needed? To sort of close the circle? 

John Turturro:It certainly helped. This is a film, it's not about violence or sex. It's about people who work with their hands. There's a lot of humor in the film. It's a very universal story. But when you go in to a room, to try and convince somebody to give you the money for that. They want to know who dies. 

Charlie Rose:Is it a happy ending? 

John Turturro:Yeah. Is it a happy -- who takes their clothes off? 

Charlie Rose:What did you say to them that this film was about, other than about the work ethic and other than about a man who lives by his hands and tries to make it on his own. 

John Turturro:I think -- you know really what this film is about, is about a group of people that came from another country, to this country and we all did that at one time. And your role model was sometimes yourself, because you weren't around your neighborhood or your village, with your people. And people didn't have a white collar education. Their proof of worth, was the job that they did. And many times, that's how they defined themselves. They defined themselves by what they did. So, compromise to them, was almost impossible. And I think that much of this film is about, that everyone has come here and struggled. But this is a film where people don't have much education. They don't have much money. They live on top of each other. They all go to the bathroom, all the brothers at the same time. That helps the humor in the film obviously. But, you're watching these people struggle somehow, to do something that will outlast them. And that was something that I witnessed, working in this milieu. And I watched my father go through that and many men like him from various different backgrounds -- want to do a job, even if they had to fight someone, where it was done in a way that they could go home and feel like, well the table is really solid and even when I'm dead, it's still gonna be really solid. I think we live in a society today, that fame is equated with equality. And this is story that hasn't been addressed at all. And I try to tell it from my background. These people, though they're flawed and crazy and funny, they also are vital to our society and I haven't seen stories about these people. Usually they're made fun of. And there is a section of our society, that doesn't really acknowledge that, that says, well these people, they're really not worth telling a story. We just want to keep them here. And they're worth telling a story about. There's many different stories to tell about these people. I just told one. 

Charlie Rose:Your father, you said would have been a great actor. Why? 

John Turturro:Well, what my father had was, he took everything personal, and he was very open. If something happened to you, you know. Say if I was on the show, and he's watching you and I said, "He was a really nice guy. Charlie's a nice guy." He of course would then continue to tell me how good a guy you were. He had that child-like quality, which he would just absorb it and make it his own. If you had a problem, he'd make his own problem. I've watched him have tremendous arguments with men on the job about buying a cup of coffee sometimes. I just think he had that natural quality. He could make believe. He made it his own. 

Charlie Rose:Tell me the story when you come home from Yale and you decide to spend a summer as a helper with your dad. Again, this is not his story. It's a story he represents and inspired this story of Mac. You come home, and you're working as a helper with your father who's on a construction project. Right? 

John Turturro:Yeah. At the Harley Hotel. It was one of the jobs I had with him. 

Charlie Rose:What happened? 

John Turturro:Well, there was a guy who was putting up very expensive wallpaper. It was like a fabric that was -- They had big ripples in it. I had the job. I had to report to my father. I was the punchless guy. Whatever was wrong, I had to tell him. Usually I would do heavy work with him, but that summer I had pad, so I told him. The next morning he got the guy, and I heard them arguing. I heard their voices go up like a pitch, an extra pitch. I was at one end of the corridor, the long hallway in a hotel. I stuck my head out of the room, and I saw them nose to nose. They guy basically was this big, much bigger than my father and much younger than him. My father had glasses on. Attacked him physically. I ran down the hallway and jumped onto his back, and basically had a big brawl. All these guys jump on top of me, and my father tried to help me and everything. Then, the guy was fired. I was so upset because my ribs were broken, I found out later on. My father was perfectly calm after five minutes. He said said, "You did the right thing." We were fighting for something worth fighting for, which was the guy had done it wrong. You know what I mean? I couldn't get over it the whole day. For him, it was just -- He would do it again. I said, "You can't keep having these fights, Dad. You're 60 years old, you have glasses on. You could hurt yourself." He goes, "No, no. I got a few shots in there." 

Charlie Rose:You said about this film, the real question in anyone's life is, what do you do with your life? Where do you find meaning? What does it cost? This Mac's story, and it's everybody else's story. Take a look at this. This is a clip from Mac. Roll tape. 

John Turturro:I hope it doesn't rain because the roof it 

Katherine Borowitz:The what? 

John Turturro:Do you see this land? This is all city property. It's going to be sold at a city auction. 

Katherine Borowitz:For how much? 

John Turturro:Exactly. I don't know, but this guy you just met, Clams, he figures somewhere between seven and 10,000. 

Katherine Borowitz:How much do you have? 

John Turturro:Half, about half. 

Katherine Borowitz:You need another five. 

John Turturro:About. 

Katherine Borowitz:Why didn't you ask me? I have money. 

John Turturro:Ask you? Ask you? 

Katherine Borowitz:What's the matter with that? I could help you. 

John Turturro:You're going to help me? 

Katherine Borowitz:Yes. It's possible. 

John Turturro:I'm going to take your money? Get out of here. 

Katherine Borowitz:I've got $4,436.26 in my savings. 

John Turturro:To the penny? 

Katherine Borowitz:26 cents to the penny. 

John Turturro:Because it's always good to be exact. 

Katherine Borowitz:I want you to have it. 

John Turturro:I'm not taking it. 

Charlie Rose:We are back talking about Mac, John Turturro's film in which he is the director as well the actor. I should say that that was your real life wife who plays your wife in the film. 

John Turturro:Katherine Borowitz. 

Charlie Rose:Yes, Katherine Borowitz. Let me talk a little bit about the making of the film and the directing experience. You've also said that the directing experience had some similarities to construction site experience, which your father an others share. What is it like for you to direct, and what was the similarities you saw there between being on a set directing a movie and in directing yourself and say what your father might have done on a construction site? 

John Turturro:Well, you are battling the time. The clock is ticking. The clouds come in and it starts to rain. You have to run inside. You have a big crew. You're trying to get everybody to work on this, to make the same film, just like you're trying to get everyone to maybe build a house. People are usually -- You have to talk over a lot of work, so voices are sometimes raised. I found it interesting that my character was doing exactly what I had to do as the director. He was in charge, and I had to sort of steer the ship against all odds. We didn't have much money. We had many, many obstacles. I had to bring everybody together. Brandon Cole was there too. 

Charlie Rose:Your co-writer? 

John Turturro:Yeah. We worked together for 12 years. 

Charlie Rose:Is directing something you want to do having done it this time? 

John Turturro:I'd like to do it again, yes. Especially with the people that I did it. I think I worked some exceptional people in the film. They were the people that I always wanted to do it. 

Charlie Rose:Tell me about the contributions of directors that you admire. Scorsese. What did he give you with respect to this film? Advice? 

John Turturro:Scorsese has been an influence on a lot of people. He is a person who told me -- He read the script. He liked it, and he said one thing that I should remember is try to tell, remember the story that you want to tell and the character that you want to show, and don't get overwhelmed by the medium, because you have to almost express your world- 

Charlie Rose:About the perfect lighting and all these other stuff. 

John Turturro:That's right. Because you want the camera to see what you see. You want what you see to be seen by other people, and that's not an easy thing to do. I story boarded the whole film. I made little drawings of every shot. Then, with my cinematographer, Ron Fortunato, we were able to stay pretty close to that. 

Charlie Rose:What did Spike Lee help you do? 

John Turturro:Well, Spike definitely gives everyone a lot of freedom. We would do a lot of improvisations with the video camera while we were rehearsing, and then sometimes incorporate what came up in the improvisation into the script. That was something that definitely I've worked that way with Spike. 

Charlie Rose:I'd heard that he also helped you in terms of story boarding. Was that he or was that -- 

John Turturro:Well, he story boards the Coens. 

Charlie Rose:The Coens. They all story board. 

John Turturro:They all do that. They all really have a particular point of view on everything. 

Charlie Rose:Why do they story board? In order to -- 

John Turturro:You start to think about, how do I really want to show this? What do I want to show? What I tried to do was put people right into the work from the beginning of it so they would feel the cement and feel everything, and then take them on this journey. It's not a linear story. It's really cumulative, and then it all adds up. I was dealing with something that I thought was very universal, that everyone in the country deals with these problems every day. It's about people going out there and saying, "This is what I'm trying to do in my life and the cost of what that is." 

Charlie Rose:I would think that as an actor, and you do this so well. You inhabit the character. There is a sense of that you bring a certain force to the character. Just reflect on that for me. How you as an actor approach character. 

John Turturro:Well, If I'm going to play a person, I attempt to, I try to make them a human being. I try to make that as personal. That's something that I got from my mother and my father. If it's not personal, then you can never be original. Even if I do all my research and do everything, I still have to try to stitch it through me in a sense and say, what would I be going through if I was in that situation? If I was in your shoes. That's what I attempt to do. Then, each character is totally different, what I do for background and what I don't do basically too. 

Charlie Rose:Your dad died at 62 years, 19 -- 

John Turturro:1988. 

Charlie Rose:1988. 

John Turturro:Right. 

Charlie Rose:He'd like the film? 

John Turturro:I think so. The film for me was done out of affection for my father. I tried to be honest with it. His spirit comes through in the film. I would hope so. 

Charlie Rose:In a sense, and I got to go, but in a sense this a marrying of who you are and who your father was in this film. 

John Turturro:Absolutely. It has to live on a creative level. 

Charlie Rose:Pleasure to have you. Thank you very much. 

John Turturro:Okay. Thank you. 

Charlie Rose:The film is called Mac. John Turturro, hope you come back. 

John Turturro:Okay. 

Charlie Rose:We'll be right back with Marcus Roberts on the stride piano. Stay with us. Pianist Marcus Roberts got his start playing in Wynton Marsalis' band. Now leading his own group, he's taken on the biggest challenge for a Jazz musician, playing Strad Piano. This difficult rhythmically style can be heard on his new record "If I Could Be With You." We'll also listen to it here when he plays for us a little bit later on. But I'm pleased to have Marcus Roberts here. Welcome. 

Marcus Roberts:Thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. I'll give you a handshake, I haven't seen you in a while. 

Marcus Roberts:I know. 

Charlie Rose:Last time you were here, Wynton was coming by and you were with him. And so you came by and joined us. 

Marcus Roberts:Right. 

Charlie Rose:And I wanted to have you back. And so it's great to see you, we once did this in Washington too. 

Marcus Roberts:We sure did. 

Charlie Rose:I should say, you didn't get your start with Wynton Marsalis, you got your start back in Florida with your mother. 

Marcus Roberts:That's true. In a good old Baptist church. 

Charlie Rose:What influence did that have? The gospel music and playing in the church? 

Marcus Roberts:Well it had a real big impact on me. That was my first introduction to the piano. And of course gospel music has a tremendous legacy which the hallmark of that tradition is Mahalia Jackson. I remember waking up 5 o'clock in the morning and momma -- she would be playing Mahalia as loud as she could. Waking us up, getting us going. I just sort of expanded from that into jazz music and studying- 

Charlie Rose:When did you start playing the piano? 

Marcus Roberts:Well I was- 

Charlie Rose:You had lessons when you were about 12 didn't you? 

Marcus Roberts:That's right. I started when I was 8 and I was self-taught. Until I was 8 I didn't know what key I was playing in or anything. And I started -- I've only had two piano teachers in my life and they were both master teachers. 

Charlie Rose:You've been blind since you were 4. 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah that's right. 

Charlie Rose:And this jazz -- one of the teachers introduced you to jazz and people began to -- or he would enable you to hear albums by Miles Davis and Art Tatum and all the greats. 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, I remember the first time I heard Tatum I was 13. And I was a real arrogant child, I thought I knew everything. And so I remember one day he said, "I want you to hear something." And he put on a -- first he put on a classical recording of Vladimir Ashkenazy playing the (inaudible) he put that on. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:Then he put on a record of Tatum, and I said, Oh, no." I said, "What two pianists is this? He said, "Oh no, that's one." I said, "what." 

Charlie Rose:It spoke to you, didn't it? 

Marcus Roberts:Oh my god, it was crazy. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Then you went on to -- did you go to Florida State? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, I sure did. 

Charlie Rose:4 years there? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah that's where I had my second teacher who taught me about the intricacies of the instrument as far as tone production and how to make the instrument ring, which is really the biggest challenge of playing the piano. 

Charlie Rose:Then you got a call from Wynton Marsalis which brings us to Wynton. And his band Carry -- what was it? 

Marcus Roberts:Kenny Kirkland. 

Charlie Rose:Kenny Kirkland. He lost his pianist. 

Marcus Roberts:Right. 

Charlie Rose:You said, "look" -- he had met you before at I guess at Florida State, had he? 

Marcus Roberts:That's right. 

Charlie Rose:So you go out to play with his band and you show up and you already know his entire repertoire. 

Marcus Roberts:Oh yeah, oh yeah. I don't know that was the only way I could see doing it. I didn't want to be there -- I knew that music was going to be hard even if you knew it. So I wanted every advantage that I could get because his music is real hard to play. 

Charlie Rose:And you were there with Wynton for 5 or 6 years right? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:When did you get (inaudible) in the albums in the first -- I remember -- I mean the albums, I've got a list of the albums here which are just -- three of them have been -- Prayer for Peace, The Truth is Spoken, Deep in the Shed, Alone with Three Giants, As Serenity Approaches which is the first time you began to play, to my knowledge, Strad piano, correct? As Serenity Approaches? 

Marcus Roberts:Right. Well no, actually even on the very first one, The Truth is Spoken here the (inaudible) that's strad. I've always been interested in it. It's just that it was an evolving sensibility that it developed -- the first recording where it's all solo piano and a lot of strad is Alone with Three Giants, that record. And then of course, they just expanded from there. Until the last one, I Could Be With You, I think is really the one where I really am expanding fully into, more and more of that history. 

Charlie Rose:We're gonna hear some of that but stay with me in understanding strad piano. Tell me about it and how do you become good at it. 

Marcus Roberts:Well the biggest challenge with playing strad is, frankly, the left hand. Because it is is two handed style. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:It's a very physical style. Very percussive style. And it does require a lot of physical part. Basically the left hand keeps the groove. That's where the dance element is. So you see, it's just leaping all over the place. Just so that the groove is there, then the right hand is free to play rhythms or motifs or whatever it wants to on top of that. But the people when they would dance to strad, they would always pay attention to that left hand because that's where the bottom was. And that's really the main essence of it. 

Charlie Rose:So when you learn to -- when you wanted to become really good at strad piano, you really had to get this left hand up to speed? 

Marcus Roberts:Oh, yeah, it's hard. Cause see what it is, you might be playing something real crazy in the right hand and -- You know, it's like hard to -- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:To keep that -- you know you have to keep track of all of these different melodies that are going at one time. 

Charlie Rose:In the beginning you learned by just playing the left hand only right? 

Marcus Roberts:Right. 

Charlie Rose:And doing it slowly, and as you get better you can do it faster- 

Marcus Roberts:Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:And develop that sort of rambunctious 

Marcus Roberts:Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:Whatever it becomes. 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah yeah yeah. 

Charlie Rose:James P. Johnson. 

Marcus Roberts:Oh my goodness. 

Charlie Rose:Who was he? 

Marcus Roberts:Oh, man. James P. Johnson was from New Brunswick, New Jersey. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Marcus Roberts:And he's a member of what we call, the Harlem Strad Piano School. And he taught Fats Waller. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Marcus Roberts:That was of course his (inaudible). 

Charlie Rose:Great strad piano. 

Marcus Roberts:Oh yeah. And he studied with Lucky Roberts who was one of the Cats around, as far as playing Rag Time. Which strad grew out of Rag Time music and the shout dances. Which James. P. Johnson's parents, they'd have these dances at the house, like all night long. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:On many week nights. They were a family of music lovers and very artistic people. And Johnson was very proficient in playing classical music. 

Charlie Rose:And influenced. His music influenced a lot of people like Duke Ellington. 

Marcus Roberts:Like Duke. That's right, Duke, Fats Waller, Count Basie. Pretty much anybody who played piano after that was influenced by -- 

Charlie Rose:Alright. This is -- I mentioned, If it Could Be You is the newest album. I have the CD in front of me. Marcus is on Tour, is on tour. Has been in New York through the 7th and he's -- where's the next -- You don't know, do you know where you appear next? 

Marcus Roberts:Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 

Charlie Rose:He'll be in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. But he's gonna play for us. Which I'm really trying to get to. This album begins with, In a Southern Sense, and then ends with In a Southern Sense. A long 9 minute piece in the end. In between, In a Southern Sense and Just a Closer Walk With You. Would you play that for me Marcus? Then we'll come back and talk. (piano music) >CHARLIE ROSE: All right. Doesn't get any better than that. Let me just make this point is that some of these are original compositions. Some of the pieces here are original compositions by you, am I right? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, some of the 16s on this record- 

Charlie Rose:Some of them. 

Marcus Roberts:Are originals. It's a retrospective recapitulation of a lot of the things that I had been working on on the piano to now, that's why like this, "Just A Closer Walk With You", that particular song, I used to play in church all the time. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah? 

Marcus Roberts:Then there's a Gershuan and a Colporter. 

Charlie Rose:Moonlight in Vermont. 

Marcus Roberts:Right, and there's- 

Charlie Rose:Now, "Keep Off the Grass", is? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, that's Johnson. 

Charlie Rose:That's Johnson. 

Marcus Roberts:That's very difficult. 

Charlie Rose:Snowy Morning Blues is Johnson, isn't it? 

Marcus Roberts:That's Johnson, that's right. 

Charlie Rose:I'm gonna have you play a little bit for me, because the most famous Johnson song, and it may be the hardest to do is "Carolina Shout", isn't it? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, that was a signature piece. That was the piano piece to play. 

Charlie Rose:All right. I'm out of time, except that I want you to play for me for two minutes. I want you to know what a pleasure it is to have you back. Come back anytime. It's great to see you. Great luck on the tour. 

Marcus Roberts:Well, thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:You are extraordinary. "Carolina Shout", James P. Johnson, this is his signature piece and we're honored to have Marcus Roberts play it and play us out of this show. Thank you for joining us. 

Marcus Roberts:Thank you very much. (piano music) 

Charlie Rose:One more time, that album by Marcus Roberts is "If I Could Be With You". An extraordinary album. It's a pleasure to have you here, my friend. 

Marcus Roberts:My pleasure. 

Charlie Rose:It's great to have you. Marcus is on tour. He was with Vice President Gore at the inauguration. It's always good to have him here. We thank you for joining us. Later this week, Governor Mario Cuomo and the Politics of America, 1993 style. In the meantime, Marcus Roberts will play us off. Marcus? (piano music)
