President Trump will mark his 100th day in office next week, and by all accounts, it will be a busy one. The administration is planning to mount a new effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. Meanwhile, the government faces a possibility of another shutdown, and there is also the issue of tax reform and infrastructure. Joining me now, with more of what to expect in Washington, Robert Costa of "The Washington Post," he's also just been named the successor to Gwen Ifill, the great Gwen Ifill, as the moderator of "Washington Week" right here on PBS. And I begin with a congratulation to Robert Costa, and also, well deserved selection by them. So I look forward to sharing Friday night with you. 

Charlie, it's a thrill, an honor to do it, and truly appreciate your support all these years going back to my internship with you in 2006. It's been phenomenal to have you there as a mentor and friend. 

Let's begin with President Trump, 100 days coming up. What can we say have been successes and failures? I mean, two things come to mind. This confirmation of a Supreme Court justice. Two, in terms of where we are now, although that people don't know the strategy, the Syrian air strike. Where would you assess the Trump administration at 100 days? 

What we're looking at is a White House that touts the Gorsuch confirmation as its signature achievement in the first 100 days. And on foreign policy they feel like they're finding some coherence, as you correctly stated due to the Syrian air strikes, that he's moving away from his noninterventionist instincts to a more traditional Republican mode of foreign policy, especially thanks to Defense Secretary Mattis, Secretary of State Tillerson, the upheaval for National Security Advisor, moving away from the more combative General Flynn to H.R. McMaster. But as they near this 100 day mark, they're still searching for a legislative achievement. That's why late this week you have the White House scrambling with House Speaker Paul Ryan to try to revive health care. Once Congress comes back next week before the 100 days is actually, hits its mark. Because they want to have something they can talk about that passes the House on health care. 

And do they think they can do that? Is that a reasonable expectation? 

It's an expectation. I wouldn't call it reasonable yet based on my reporting. There is a real tension, Thursday, in Washington about what's possible on health care. Republicans on Capitol Hill who I have spoken with the top ones in the leadership say they don't have the votes yet in the House to pass any kind of health care legislation. But the president himself, I'm told by White House officials, is putting his foot on the pedal and saying I don't care what the Hill is saying about the vote count. I need this to move in the House next week. That's why you have chief of staff Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, the chief strategist, trying to work with the hardline Freedom Caucus to come up with some kind of consensus plan. 

Are they having any success with the Freedom Caucus? 

So far, the Freedom Caucus has been working closely with the White House on a revised bill. They're talking about high-risk pools, a different kinds of conservative elements that they want to inject into the legislation, less spending. At the same time, the leadership is still wary. If the White House cuts a deal with the Freedom Caucus on health care, does it actually hurt the final tally among House Republicans? In other words, if you give the Freedom Caucus what it wants, do some moderates then in the House GOP become wary of the legislation? 

Have they given up any idea that somehow they may be able to attract some Democrats if they make the bill a little bit different? 

Not at all. There's very low expectations about Democratic input. If you look at -- I was just in Atlanta, Charlie, for three days covering that special House election, and then I spoke to Senator Van Hollen of Maryland, and others who are working on Senate races this year. And they say the Democrats have so much grassroots energy on the left, and they look at what happened, even though they didn't win the seat in Georgia, they got close to 50 percent. They don't see any impetus, any reason to move towards the Republicans on health care because they think President Obama's base, which didn't come out in droves in 2016, could come out in 2018, and help Democrats maybe even win back the House, if health care is an animating issue. 

Yet, at the same time I see where fundraising for the Trump administration and for the Republican Party is going quite well. 

It is, and you look at the president's popularity with the Republican base, it's sky high. Overall, the president's approval rating has been at times ticking below 40 percent. And that's caused some alarm inside of the White House. But the Republican base sees this hard-charging president in spite of all of his flaws and controversies, as someone who's, in a way, an outsider in Washington. And that's what many of them wanted. 

With respect to repeal and replace, the president keeps insisting that it ought to go first, in part because he needs it to help him with tax reform and even infrastructure. I assume some revenue or some tax credits or something is coming out of that. 

Well, if you look at what the Republican health care bill is in the house, it's in essence a health, not only a health care bill but a tax bill. 

Right. 

And as the speaker has explained to the president, the president has been told that you need to do health care first to get rid of some of the Obamacare taxes to pave the path for tax reform and then for infrastructure. But there is again this tension between Capitol Hill Republicans and the White House because people close to the president say there's part of the president that wishes he went first with infrastructure, brought in some Democrats, and didn't go after President Obama's most famous law as his first move. 

With respect to tax reform, what is it that they want to do? 

It's been intriguing to watch Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, take the reins of tax reform. Of course, treasury secretary Mnuchin is involved in the process, and so are House Republicans. But what Cohn has been working on based on my conversations with many members in Congress and the White House, is they want to get rid of some deductions, but really it's about corporate tax cuts. And what they're really negotiating now is what is that rate going to be, coming down from 35, is it going to be 20, is it going to be 22. What's the calculation politically and policy wise on all the different individual, but most especially the corporate rates. That's what they're trying to figure out as Congress comes back. 

And they also want to figure out how to get all that money that's overseas held by corporations back to the United States. 

And that's why the Democrats see somewhat of an opening to maybe shape the tax reform discussion because they know the president has put such an emphasis on this buy American idea, and the repatriation of American dollars, and dollars back into the American economy. And so, when I talk to Democrats on Capitol Hill they say they would like to actually drive a wedge between the Ryan wing and the Trump wing, and offer the president some populist ideas in taxes to see if he'll maybe move in their direction. 

Speaking of wings and speaking of Gary Cohn, what factions are fighting within the White House and who's winning? 

I think you could say the New York crowd, the financial crowd, with Jared Kushner, the son in law and president's senior advisor at the top, he's really pushing the president softly, Trump's not someone who likes to be yanked, as we know. The president is listening more to Kushner, to Gary Cohn, to Dina Powell, the deputy national security advisor who works closely with McMaster, who is a traditional Republican. She also of course used to work for Goldman Sachs. He knows that his stumble on health care and some of these hardline actions on immigration that were shaped by Steven Miller and Steven Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have, in a way, in his mind, led to his unpopularity. So he's starting to rethink, as he did during the campaign at many points, the input, and how much he should weigh certain advisors. Bannon, though, is still in the mix. He hasn't resigned even though he lost some of his political capital. He's been much more quiet in recent days, but that doesn't mean he's gone away. 

And you don't expect him to go soon. 

No, I don't expect Bannon to leave at all. Bannon, in his mid-60s, this is the project of his life. From Hollywood to Breitbart, he's been someone who's been at the fringes of American political life, now finds himself at the center. He's not rushing for the door. 

But the question is not whether he's rushing, the question is whether he'll be pushed. 

I think the question whether Bannon leaves, if he can repair his relationship with Jared Kushner, he'll stay. If he cannot, and it remains as fiery as it's right now based on my reporting, that he could find himself out in a few weeks, even a few months. The problem for Bannon is he was smart during the campaign to build his alliance with Kushner who didn't have a firm grasp of what Breitbart was all about and what the Trump base was all about, and he saw in Bannon someone who could help him interpret these voters and formulate policy and strategy. But since the election, that relationship between Bannon and Kushner that has been so crucial for Trump has frayed. And if Bannon can't fix that, he will be on the outs. 

Let me turn to Syria and also North Korea. What are the lessons that you draw from the Syrian strike. 

It's not so much -- it's not clear yet, Charlie, what the strategy is. But I think that episode was very revealing about how the president's evolved on national security and foreign policy. I'm told he's listening closely to the cabinet, to McMaster, to Tillerson, to Mattis, and he's very militaristic in his instincts. We saw this during the campaign as well. But he remains averse to intervention, to the idea of ground troops. He was against part of the Iraq intervention even though he initially supported it. He's not talking about sending in troops to Syria, but he likes the idea of targeted strikes projecting American strength but not having American lives be at risk in an extensive way. And with North Korea, he enjoys this confrontational style. Not just on domestic politics but as we're learning in foreign policy. Even though he doesn't have this amazing depth on the North Korean issue, and he's not articulating new policy day to day, and Pence, the vice president, keeps talking about honoring U.S. allies as he's abroad in Asia. We are seeing this confrontational style rather than a doctrine really define the policy. 

With respect to North Korea, as the president listens to his advisors, he seems to be listening mostly, as you suggest, to H.R. McMaster, to his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and to his Secretary of Defense General Mattis. Is that a fair appraisal of who has his ear in terms of the military decisions he has to make? 

It is, but I think with North Korea, you have to include President Xi Jinping of China. I'm told by my sources that that meeting at Mar-a-Lago was very important for Trump as he understands U.S.-Asia policy, U.S.-China relations. He was told in various meetings at Mar-a-Lago that the Chinese perspective was that North Korea shouldn't be engaged too much to the point where maybe North Korea would collapse and disrupt the region, disrupt China. And the president listened to the Chinese leader talk through some of these complicated issues about how to box in North Korea, how confrontation can work to a point. He learned a lot about the weaknesses in North Korea's economy, and about its missile program, how it doesn't even really have many ballistic missiles if any, how its nuclear program is really nascent. And these things were all part of the discussions. This is a president, who likes to remember, still learning on the job in particular with foreign policy. 

The president said he liked and learned a lot from Xi Jinping. Do we know what Xi Jinping thought of the president? 

Well, there is that moment that the president's recounted to his friends often that he wanted to show American strength to the Chinese, talking about the Syrian strikes as they're eating dinner and as Trump has called it, the big beautiful chocolate cake they were having for dessert, that is a typical way Trump tells stories. But it's an important moment because how is -- Trump comes back to this foreign policy. He's not developing a doctrine, but he wants to show world leaders like Xi Jinping that he's willing to take risk and action and be kind of a cool hand in these meetings as he goes about his foreign policy. That was a symbolic moment for this White House. And it was a moment that was planned. 

The president seems to be tweeting things that will distract from policy less, even though he continues to tweet. Is there a change in terms of what he has learned works for him and what doesn't? Not that he will stop tweeting, but he understands what kinds of tweets are best not sent? 

There is no clear revised plan. But he was tweeting a lot about the Georgia special House election. It really got under his skin in the way he saw it as a target on him that the seat could go. So he became involved in tweeting over and over again this week about the Georgia race. I'm told from his advisors, Charlie, that a lot of times he's watching television, cable channel, and reacting to something he hears. And so, it's all these -- this orbit around the president is so important, not just the conversations with advisors but with friends, with foreign leaders, and what he digests from television coverage because he's not someone who loves reading briefing memos. And so he's listening and hearing the national conversation, the international conversation and reacting. It's for others to judge that but that is what he's doing inside of the White House, and that hasn't changed. 

What has changed? 

I think he's been humbled by the health care experience as we've discussed, when he called me on the phone after it all fell apart. He's someone who is recognizing that running the country is difficult but so is running the Republican Party. This is a factionalized party that controls the House, the Senate and the White House, but it's not in any way together. And stitching a coalition together for any kind of major initiative is going to be very challenging for him this year. He's starting to recognize that, and I think that humbled approach to legislation has been something that really changed. What he thought he could do at the top of his agenda at the beginning so much. 

What does he think of the ratings when he looks at the polls? 

Charlie, going back to 2013 when I first started to interview him, he would talk about polls like they were ratings. In fact, sometimes it would slip in conversations, he'd go, look at those ratings, look at those ratings, he was talking about polls. In his office at Trump Tower, he used to have all of his ratings in a frame, and he had them all over the wall. Among the pictures of himself, he would have these ratings for "The Apprentice." He takes pride and he's very sensitive to his public standing. And so, when you're trying t0 understand -- what I'm trying to understand as a reporter, why is he listening more to Gary Cohn, and Dina Powell, and Jared Kushner? Why is he becoming more traditionally hawkish on foreign policy? Always come back to his habits. He's watching the polls as if they're ratings. He's listening to the television commentary and the chattering in Washington, and he's reacting to it and formulating new strategies. 

Who is the last person he would talk to if he had to make an important decision? 

On different fronts, usually Jared Kushner, his daughter, Ivanka, has on major decisions as someone he thinks she has a good feel for many things, many issues, Bannon on a lot of the immigration and trade issues. But I think what's most important to Trump is not who he talks to last, Charlie, it's the group he talks to last, the friends outside of the White House, Tom Barrack, who's been on your show a lot, the people outside of Washington who he looks to for a gut check. 

A lot of phone calls by Donald Trump to reach out and say how I'm doing, what do you recommend, what do you think, where should I go. 

Late at night, business leaders, friends from the golf course, friends from New York. And he doesn't often tell his aides about who he's talking to. So Bannon and Priebus could say good-bye to him at 9:00 at night. He goes up to the residence, but he's on that phone, watching TV, talking with friends with the TV on, thinking through the presidency. It's something unlike anything we've really seen before, but he has this circle outside of politics that he's regularly turning to for advice. 

And after 9:00, he's essentially alone. 

His wife, the first lady, is up in New York with his young son, Baron. And he's alone in the residence with the television, and with his, perhaps, at times his phone and Twitter. 

And in the morning when he gets up at whatever time. 

Very early. 

3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, somewhere like that, He immediately seems to start tweeting. Most of the tweets we see come early in the morning. Again, he's alone and watching television. 

And he's a 70-year-old man and he has his habits. I'm told he has the print versions of the newspapers, which, as a "Post" guy, I'm fine with, he scans "The Times," scans the "New York Post." Important for him to understand that tabloid style from the '80s that lifted him still stays with him. And he scans "The New York Times," "The Post," The New York Post" and "Washington Post. And then he turns on "Fox &amp; Friends" or "Morning Joe," although he seems to have moved away from that a little bit. And he just starts to think about the news. It's a news-driven presidency. 

Thank you so much for joining us. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

We'll be right back, stay with us.
