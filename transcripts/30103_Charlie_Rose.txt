Stay with us. 

For the last 20 years, Paul Goldberger as the arbiter of architecture in The New York Times, has made his mark on the sacred skyline of the city, like no other critic. In 1984, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his commentary. Just last year, as the old gray lady braced itself for a makeover, he was named the powerful post of Cultural News Editor. His charges have the first and often the last word on what we see in a theater, eat in a restaurant, or watch on television. We're pleased to have Paul Goldberger join us now, to talk about his new job at The Times, as well as architecture here in the city. First, the new job. You have all of the ... Who reports to you? What reporters? 

All the reporters who cover cultural affairs, arts, and entertainment, and all the critics. 

The notion is, that this gives you some exalted notion in the city because the power of The Times. Because Frank Rich and all those people who have powerful influence over culture, somehow, you know- 

The real truth is, it's widely exaggerated, I think. I wish I can sit here and say to you, "We have absolute power over everything." 

This is one powerful man. 

What we decree opens, what we decree closes, what we decree succeeds, and what we decree fails. In fact, it's not really true at all. I think we have enormous authority. Everybody reads The Times, everybody pays attention to what we say, everybody listens. But then in fact they do whatever they please. 

Frank is a better known name, I mean there are a lot of other people with equal power and skill at The Times with ... Certainly equal skill. Do you edit Frank Rich's copy? 

Lightly, yes. Heavily, no. We believe that we have the best critics of any newspaper in America. We want people we don't want to edit very much. In fact, as a critic myself, I have an enormous sense of respect for writer's voice. I didn't like it when people played around with my voice. Now as an editor, I don't want to play around with other people's voices. I think the most important thing is to, sort of nurture writers and critics so that they will speak most naturally in their own voices. I don't feel that it's our job to shape and change them. If they're wrong, if they're no good, if they don't have a natural feel for what they're doing, we should really get other people. 

You should change critics, rather that edit their copy? 

We should change critics. Exactly. Right. I don't what to make myself into the theater critic. I don't want to make myself into a movie critic. I don't want to make myself into a dance critic. 

Is there pressure on you from the business interest, that advertise in The Times? In any way people who say, "My God, look what you guys are doing to the city, because of the criticism that comes from your paper?" 

There's a little bit. Except The Times has always being really forthright and wonderful, in fact, in creating a kind of church and state separation. Our business affairs as a company, as a newspaper are separate from what we put into the paper. We think our reputation really comes from that. That we write with a sense of independence, that is not connected to our advertising columns. There have been times when people have pulled their advertising, and generally- 

Because they didn't like- Because they thought- 

Because they didn't like something that was said and they- 

Critics said- 

Generally come quietly creeping back after a period of time. We make a point of not deliberately antagonizing people. We try not to have our criticism be personal. We feel ultimately the greatest respect we can show is applying high standards fairly and across the board. 

Asking you to speak for the paper, and especially the area that you cover, whether is architecture, whether is theater whatever, restaurants or whatever it is. How do you guard yourself and make sure that the opinions expressed are judicious? How do you check your own power? 

Well we do, in fact, try to check our own power. We review our own stuff very carefully to be sure that it meets the kind of standard of fairness, is the only way to put it. 

Book review is another good example, that I've forgotten about- 

Sure. Sure. We will say, that this book does not represent the highest standards, the writer seems to have failed to do this, that, and the other thing. We don't write that the writer's a sleazeball. We don't write that this movie that is not very good fails because the director's an idiot. We may write that the movie- 

This is the kind of saying that John Simon might say in a review. 

I mean we may well write that the movie is a cataclysmic failure. We may well write that- 

That the director is awful? 

We're stunned that there could be such a miscalculation, the direction is awful, the acting is terrible, it's a total waste of two hours and umpteen millions of dollars, but we don't write ad hominem attacks on- 

If you saw that you may call that reporter on that or that critic on that point- 

That's right. Absolutely. 

And say we are not going to allow that pass. 

We don't do it this way. This is not our way. We don't want to reign you in too much, if you really feel that the work deserves this, fine, but the creator deserves a degree of respect. We try to be the same about institutions too. I mean, we feel we have a great stake in the future of the city of New York. We survive along with it. While we may be very critical of what certain institutions do. We may say- 

Certain developers- 

Certain developers or anything else. We may say, that the Philharmonic has made a terrible mistake with this new program or this soloist or this piece of music. But we will not say, "What a pointless orchestra and how stupid it is that we continue to have an orchestra at Lincoln Center." 

Have you ever regretted a column you've written in terms of architecture? A critical piece and said, "I think I went too far there," or I made a mistake," or "I change my mind. 

No. Actually to be perfectly honest, when I've look back over the years, I've had almost no regrets. If they were any it's that sometimes I've been almost too fair minded I think. I have a great ... This sense of fairness that we've been talking about is something I believe very deeply, I think it's what The Times has always stood for. I think if anything, I may have bent over backwards a little too far, to try to give both sides of the question. Some questions don't have two sides. Sometimes I've sort of ... Actually, if I have any regrets and they're not a lot, they're more on that direction. 

It's clear that Frank Rich is a powerful person here. 

Sure. 

Been a guest on this show, someone I'd like to have back because I enjoy talking to him on this broadcast and admiring. Do you have to protect him? Because he does anger people, and that's his role as a critic, is to say what he says. Do you protect him in any way from-? 

Yeah, absolutely. 

How so? 

Mainly by writing what I hope are diplomatic and cordial but absolutely firm letters to people who argue, take issue with his writing. We get a lot of them. We try to answer them without yielding any ground about his critical independence. Yeah, probably of all the critics I get the most negative mail about Frank Rich- 

Because this city feels so, and there's people this city feel so intensely- 

I've got to tell you, I feel very convinced where Frank is concerned that it emerges not out of a dislike of the theater, not out of a disdain for the theater, but out of a very deep and abiding love for the theater, and a set of very high standards. In fact, I tell that to people over and over again when we do defend him. I don't mind people taking issue with specific judgments about specific plays. The letters that really drive me crazy are the ones that say, "This is a man who's out to destroy the theater." Absolutely not true. 

One last quick question about Frank Rich- 

Sure. Sure. 

A journalist like you, you understand me asking this question. People said that you two were great friends and then there was a conflict, there was something happened? 

Early on, it's true. There was a sort of hysterical event that happened, now, actually a year ago. When David Merrick took out a very vicious ad about Frank, in a page of The New York Times. It involved Frank and his present wife, who was then his fiance who was a reported at The Times. Frank was deeply upset. In fact went through a period of being very upset with just about everybody in authority at The Times, including me, for not getting the ad pulled in time to miss all editions. In fact, did miss the late edition but ran in the early edition. That's ancient history. It's long since over. In fact we worked together very happily. The most enthusiastic letters I write are the ones defending him as I just told you. 

John Simon and Norman Mailer, explain this notion of having a writer, have an opportunity to respond to a critic? 

Okay. That's something that didn't fall directly within my purview. Becky Sinkler the editor of our book review, which is one of the few autonomist sections that does not come under my purview. I actually handled that. There, I think the sense was that we were dealing with a writer of such enormous magnitude and importance to our culture that he deserved, not the consideration of an automatic favorable review, not the consideration of the chance to adjust or change a review, or anything like that, but the right of a slightly special reply. Although ultimately, of course, that really ran as an extended letter ... 

It sure did. 

Which meant that we were not really breaking our tradition, except giving him a little more space. 

Did you agree with that decision? I mean would you ... 

To do the letter? 

Yeah. 

Um, Yeah. I think it was handled the right way. I think, that to have allowed him to write a separate article as a rebuttal would have set a precedent that would have been very awkward. We run letters all the time including letters from disgruntled authors in the book review. They are rarely that long and that disgruntled, but on the other hand, you know, it's Norman Mailer. I think there was a sense that there was something legitimate he had to say. I think we handled it okay. 

You know, your first job coming out of Yale was at the New York Times. 

Yeah, I went to work for the Times Sunday magazine. 

You actually worked for them when you were at Yale, didn't you? 

I sold a couple of freelance pieces. 

And came right away working for the magazine, was it? 

Yeah. Went to work for the magazine when I got out of college. 

And pretty soon thereafter was named Architecture critic. 

A couple years later-- 

And you succeeded Ada Louise Huxtable, right? 

Right. 

And, now you're succeeding ... who was a giant in her field ... and now you're succeeding ... she'd won a Pulitzer hadn't she? Or not? 

Yes, she did. She in fact won the very first Pulitzer ever given for criticism at all. 

For criticism? 

The category of Pulitzer prizes for arts criticism was invented for Ada Louise in 1970. And, uh ... 

And now you choose to follow in the footsteps of Arthur Gayle, another giant some call a cultural maven of ... enormous power and enormous influence certainly. Not just because ... because of his job, considered a power within the community, or cultural community. You choose big shoes to fill. 

I'm not sure I actively chose them. They just kind of happened. But, Arthur is a remarkable editor. He's really an extraordinary ... 

What scares you the most about the job? I mean, what's exciting about the job, and what scares you about it, and how do you make your mark? 

What excites me is easy. First, it's great to be pedaling uphill after years of doing the same thing. Loving it passionately. I still do, which is why I still do it part-time as well. It's exciting to have a real steep learning curve and to be learning new things all the time. What frightens me is exactly the same thing; having a steep learning curve and doing new things all the time. The hardest thing actually so far, the hardest thing is actually having to come to work every day and sit in an office all day. After years of kinda just moving around the city and doing what I pleased, and as long as I met my deadlines, nobody cared whether I sat at a desk or not. Coming to work and being there from 9-7 or 8 every single night. That's exhilarating but also tough. 

There's also another dimension, which I suspect you had not experienced before. You're involved in the care and nurturing of writers. A paper is no better than it's writers. You know, and you were one of them. And now you're involved in the business of nurturing and making sure that they maximize their own talent. 

But that's a very exciting thing, actually, to learn to get your own ego-gratification through the work of other people. 

Is it hard? 

Uh, it is tough, but there's a great excitement to it at the same time. In the same way that, when you become a parent, you learn about certain things of the same sort. Also, I think it's real important ... It's the first time there's ever been a critic running that department. Most of the people over the years have been, sort of, general editors. This is the first time that the department has been run by a peer. I mean, I come from that side of the aisle. It's what I care about. I'm determined to respect the integrity. 

It's kind of like a quarterback. 

Exactly. I see myself as, sort of, a player-manager there, which is real important. 

You're writing a new book, which I'm not sure is out, on experience of architecture. 

It's not only not out, it's not finished, and this new job puts it a little farther behind. 

Would you come back and talk about architecture? I've got a lot of questions I want to ask you ... 

I'd love to. 

I love architecture and I want to talk about the buildings and walking through the city. 

If the recession gives us any more architecture, I'd love to talk about it. 

Well, I hope it will. Thank you very much Paul.
