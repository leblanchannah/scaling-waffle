Good evening, I'm Jeff Glor, filling in for Charlie Rose who is away today. We begin the program with politics. On Friday, the Trump administration announced it would discontinue public access to logs of visitors to the White House. Meanwhile, protesters across the nation demanded the president release his tax returns ahead of Tuesday's tax deadline. On the foreign policy front, tensions with North Korea further escalated over the weekend, and today in the wake of Pyongyang's failed missile test on Sunday. While visiting South Korea, Vice President Pence warned the North Koreans not to test President Trump, citing the recent U.S. strikes on Syria and Afghanistan. Joining me now from Washington, David Frum, senior editor at "The Atlantic". His latest article is called, "Trump's plan to end Europe". And Philip Rucker, White House bureau chief at "The Washington Post". Julie Hirschfeld Davis who covers the White House for "The New York Times" will join us momentarily. I'm pleased to have all of them on this program -- this evening. And David, let me start with you. I know the article is about Europe, but I do want to start with Asia since it's top of mind today and Vice President Pence's visit in particular. What is the administration looking for? 

Who can say? One of the things that is really striking about the administration's mode of proceedings, is it is usually the greater power that tries to deescalate the situation. The United States has had a posture with North Korea of recognizing North Korea is in it for the money. They're not really a strategic actor. And the more you increase the apparent value of their nuisance, the more they will try to charge to have the nuisance go away. And the United States, it does not have credible military options. Everybody knows that. The Trump administration doesn't have much of an alliance structure. Remember it began the administration by blowing up the Transpacific Partnership, something that all our friends in the Pacific are deeply vested in. So it's hard to see much of a plan other than squinting and looking tough and promising to do things that your opponents know you're not going to do. 

Philip, where did the administration want this conversation to go right now? 

Well, they want to apply pressure on China. There is that sense within the White House that they very much like to see China apply more pressure on North Korea, not only militarily, but more importantly, economically, try to pressure the North Korean regime, try to deescalate with North Korea. I think Trump is feeling very good about the relationship that he built with President Xi over the last -- the trip a couple of weeks ago. But really wants him, wants China to follow through on that and to apply more pressure to North Korea. 

Julie, if you are with us now, same question to you regarding North Korea. I guess these are two separate questions. But where does the administration want this conversation to go and where do they think it can go? 

Well, I think you heard David talk about the challenges of actually making any substantive progress in the way that past administrations haven't. I think President Trump really wants to show that he can do these, sort of deal-making relationship building things, and the relationship with President Xi, I think the White House sees as one example of that. If they can get him to step forward and apply some pressure where China hasn't been willing to before, that would be a win, obviously, a peaceful solution to these mounting threats, and a show of Donald Trump's ability to kind of maneuver in a geo political sphere that we haven't seen from him before. So I think it's important for them, foreign policy wise, obviously, but he also wants to show that he's a strong president who can pull some of these strings. And so, I think that's part of the reason we hear the White House talking and leaning so hard on this idea of China stepping up. 

And Philip, there's confidence from the White House that after a candidate was so critical of a country during the campaign, that the president now believes he has a relationship with President Xi that can get something done. 

I think that's right. They feel like the relationship is very strong, that they think China will want to help the United States in terms of sort of further fostering that friendship and come to the table a little bit, in terms of applying pressure to North Korea. There is another player here to think about as well, and that's Japan, obviously, right there in the region. But Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan also developed a warm relationship with President Trump over the last couple of months. The Japanese are watching this very closely. They would also like to see China apply some more pressure on North Korea, and I think we're very encouraged, frankly, by what President Trump was doing elsewhere in the world with the bombing in Syria and last week in Afghanistan, saw him as a decisive leader willing to take action in a way President Obama was not. And so that's encouraged the Japanese. 

David, can you -- 

Can I file a mild protest against the discussion that we're having. 

This is where I was going to go with you. Let me see if this answers your question. As far as the warming of relationships, I think the White House believes that the president can very quickly establish these nice friendships with foreign leaders which may not have -- is that naive of them to think? 

Look, here is the protest I was going to file. I'm not a White House correspondent and I have total respect for the people who work that very challenging beat. But what happens if you cover the White House is you go to Sean Spicer or Michael Anton or any other of the administration's designated talkers and you say, so how is the relationship with China? And they say it's fabulous. It's a lot better than it was under that dope Obama. Two problems, these guys don't know anything. And second, they lie all the time. It would be helpful, now that's not your beat, but if you -- 

Don't pull any punches, David. 

If you say to the Chinese or Japanese, so how is the relationship, you might get a different answer. And they have, I suspect the Chinese have a much more pragmatic and instrumental view of their relationship with the Trump administration. Remember they tried to do that $400 million dollar rescue of the Jared Kushner's troubled interest in an office building in New York. Remember how they have given Donald Trump a lot of licenses in China, a lot of copyrights rather -- trademarks, I should say, that he has been seeking for a decade without success. Notice the huge increase in purchases in goods branded to Ivanka Trump from China, and the interest in Ivanka Trump as a brand suddenly from inside China. They recognize these family dynastic relationships, that's how much of China is governed. But the idea that they have warm feelings towards Donald Trump, or that -- they may flatter his view of himself as a strong leader, but one of the things that strong leaders don't do is bluff. And what we have seen again and again in Syria, in Afghanistan, and now most ominously in North Korea is a politics based on bluff. 

We saw that some would say with the health care debate domestically as well, or at least pushing it to where it got. But, David, we should -- you can't discount the notion that the healthy intrapersonal relationship can certainly help get something done. 

I totally discount it and reject it. The way you and I and most of us go through life is we like people and therefore we get along with them. The way it works between world leaders is they decide that they need to get along and then they develop the relationship. The relationship does not lead the analysis of interests. The relationship follows. And if you don't understand that, then your feelings are going to be manipulated which is something that does seem to happen to Donald Trump from time to time. China and Japan, they have very intraspace foreign policy, salute them for that, so do the Koreans, and they have a lot at stake, the risk of a terrible war in their immediate neighborhood. And they are a lot more concerned about getting things done than how they are perceived by, in the Chinese case, their state controlled media, by Japan and South Korea, in media that are less vested in the president's personal narrative, than this president, this White House, and to some extent, our media are. 

OK, so where does this Pence visit go, and where does the conversation then go? 

Where does the Pence -- I think there's going to be a lot of squinting and a lot of jawed looks across the DMZ, a lot of leather jacket pictures. There is an aircraft carrier in the region, it will steam in. It won't do much and then it will eventually steam out. And two weeks from now, I think this problem will look very similar to the way the problem looks today because Donald Trump doesn't have any more levers over China than President Obama or President Bush did. But what he has done is signaled that this deal is much more important to him than it was to President Obama or President Bush. And as the ghost writer of the "Art of the Deal" could have told him, that when you look like you want something very badly, you have to pay more for it. 

Julie, is the -- does the administration right now, notwithstanding some of David's thoughts on this, with all due respect, are they confident that the way this, the North Korea conversation is going right now is one they want to hear? 

Well no, I don't think they are. I think there's a lot of anxiety behind the scenes about how this all plays itself out. And of course they are developing all of their options and, you know, we hear a lot of, as David said, tough talk about, you know, the era of strategic patients being over and we're ready to move it to the next phase here. But the fact is, if they are not able to get China to step up, and even potentially if they are able to somehow persuade China to do something it hasn't been willing to do in the past and apply more economic pressure to North Korea, it's not clear what their end game is going to be. They keep on -- we heard the national security advisor talk over the weekend about we want to resolve this peacefully. We want to do this in a way that doesn't involve the military. But if you look at their statements and you look at what's happening on the ground, it's not clear how they can do that. And I don't think they have a clear sense of that right now. So, let's not forget as well, you know, part of the play putting pressure on China, I mean, it is the fact that, you know, this administration hasn't really gotten much out of China. They talk a lot about this warm relationship. They're really good friends now. They had their chocolate cake. But we haven't actually seen any of the fruits of that and so it remains to be seen. And I think some people inside the White House acknowledge this, that it remains to be seen how much can really come of this, you know, outwardly looking better rapport. 

Philip, to you, I mean, before we button up North Korea here, where do you think this goes next? 

I don't know. I think Julie hit it exactly right. There's not a clear end point here inside the White House. There's much more anxiety behind the scenes than you see publicly in their comments and their rhetoric. But I don't think they've figured out where this all goes. You know, clearly they want China to step up and they're trying to kind of take this day by day, but there doesn't seem to be a grand strategy that lays out what will happen three months from now, six months from now, a year from now. 

All right, well, David, I think cites one sort of grand strategy in jest in "The Atlantic" this month. So David, we can move on to that now and talk about Europe. The article is called, "Trump's plan to end Europe." Why? 

Well, one of the things that we notice both about candidate Trump and about the first weeks of the Trump presidency was their extraordinary hostility to the European Union. And this manifested itself -- I mean, in the negative comments about NATO before the election, the encouragement to Great Britain to exit the European Union which reverses American foreign policy going back to the Ford administration and even before, and generally their hostility to the institution. Some of this is just ignorance that when President Trump says to Angela Merkel we would like to negotiate a trade treaty with Germany, I think he sincerely did not know that that is a confidence that the Germans and other European states have moved to the E.U. level that you no longer can negotiate a trade treaty with Germany. But some of it does seem to be, and many of the people around the administration, some of his trade advisors like Peter Navarro, do seem to see Germany in particular, which is a major exporter, as an economic competitor like China, they discount the value of the other important things in our relationship. And they are hostile to it, the European Union want to weaken it and break it up. You see that in the flirtation with people like Nigel Farage and Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front which wants to break up the euro currency and maybe lead France out of Europe altogether, out of the European Union altogether. It's very ominous and it is especially ominous when you remember that the highest priority of Russian foreign policy is to sever the tie between the United States and Germany and to crack up the European Union because Europe together is much stronger than Russia. Russia has a GDP about the size of Italy. Europe separate, no country is anywhere near as strong as Russia. 

But, as you said, we've certainly seen some remarkable revolutions from the president in just the past few days on multiple issues. So should we not expect there might be one on Europe then as well, David? 

Well, to my embarrassment, one of the revolutions happened on the very day that the article was released. That was the day that Donald Trump said I've changed my mind and NATO is no longer obsolete. It was dead and now it's not dead anymore. So, yes, I'm sure he's very mercurial and impulsive. He's got thin attachments to things. But there is certain harms that once done can't be undone. Remember back in 2013 and 11, when we were talking about the United States defaulting on its obligations, when you take the possibility something like that from zero to not zero, that is an irrevocable event, and when you take the idea that the United States might not honor its NATO treaty commitments from zero to non-zero, that is something you can't unsay. And while we now are -- while the administration is projecting less hostility toward the European Union as an institution, the animus of the president himself is still pretty visible and the people around him also have their animuses, and when you look at their relationships they choose to have, and with whom they choose to have them, the fact that people like Nigel Forage get a much warmer treatment than Angela Merkel does, people in Europe notice that. And the most dangerous thing that happens is they then begin thinking we need a plan for our security, premised on the idea the United States is no longer a reliable partner and guarantor. 

Right. But is it possible that those who show that same animus who would rather meet with Forage than Merkel are being pushed to the side in whatever ways in this White House now? 

Well, one of them is in the Oval Office. And he is there for the duration. 

Where is Steve Bannon right now? 

Well, unlike the "Saturday Night Live" portrayal, Steve Bannon is at work. He still has his job. He remains the chief strategist, although his portfolio is much smaller and his influence has been, I would say, greatly diminished. He continues to advise the president. He continues to be a part of meetings and strategy discussions. But he doesn't have the kind of singular power that he had in those early weeks of the presidency when people would refer to him as the shadow president, if you will. The person who has more power now is Jared Kushner who's really been able to kind of consolidate some influence in the White House. He's overseeing a lot of issues directly, including the relationship with China, very involved in foreign policy as well as economic issues and the federal bureaucracy. And I don't think Jared is going anywhere. So basically if you want to exist with some portfolio and influence within this Trump circle, you have to learn to coexist with Jared Kushner and that's been a problem for Steve Bannon. 

Julie? 

Well, I mean, it's been interesting to watch these relationships develop. One of the things that we all talked about when Donald Trump first considered bringing Jared Kushner on to his team at the White House is you can't fire your son-in-law. And indeed what we see is that he has risen in influence. And as some of these issues have really gotten much more difficult than I think the White House started off viewing them, you know, it's become clear that Steve Bannon's influence is not going to be enough to get them where they want to go. And it seems that Trump, if you listen to what he says, has to some degree lost a bit of confidence in Bannon. That said, he's still, as Phil pointed out, the chief strategist. He still does have power and proximity to the president. And I think a lot of that power comes from the way in which their thinking is aligned on a lot of these issues. So even if he is -- and I do think his influence has been diminished a bit. He obviously came off of the National Security Council and that was a big sort of symbolic as well as substantive step back, he and Donald Trump share the same approach to a lot of these issues. And it's not really clear where Jared Kushner is coming from on a lot of these things. He doesn't have a foreign policy worldview, at least not one that's been laid out clearly for me, in a way that you might expect someone who is advising the president at that high a level on this many high profile foreign policy issues would have. And so, I think, you know, as long as Bannon is there, he is going to continue to have some influence and a fairly sizeable one on this president because they think in a lot the same ways on a lot of these issues. 

David, I'm loathed to throw you such a loaded question here. But how can you come into office expecting that these issues are not going to be as hard as you think they were? 

Well, it's a combination of ignorance and arrogance that is a terrible problem. Just a thought on the Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner story. There is a very strong narrative line that has developed in a lot of way we report this. I understand it and I'm sympathetic to it. I was in a coffee shop a few weeks after the election -- a few days after the election. And someone I knew a little bit came up to me, recognized me from childhood, put her hand on my shoulder and said tell me everything is going to be OK. And I think a lot of us who cover politics have an impulse that we want to give an answer to that person that will make her feel better. And so we create a story where Steve Bannon is the source of all the irregularities and anomalies in the White House. And if only something would happen to him, and somebody nicer like Jared Kushner were to take over, things would be better. Things would be OK. They're not going to be OK. With Jared Kushner, you get a different set of problems than you do with Steve Bannon. Obviously, he is way less ideological. He's not connected to Breitbart. But he doesn't know anything. And even more than that, the problems of integrity, public integrity that have stocked this White House become worse the more power that the Kushner family has. I mean, it was the Kushner family that negotiated this $400 million payout from a Chinese state-influenced bank. Although that deal had to be dropped in the face of pressure from Congress, presumably every day, people in the Kushner family circle are thinking about similar kinds of transactions, and having the affairs of the United States in the hands of people who really don't know anything about them. And, look, 35, they're not children, I mean, it's half your life on this planet, haven't bothered to learn anything, whose idea of research is to go to Amazon.com and Google the titles of books -- 

Reportedly. 

Reportedly, if true, and then the book you pick is one that nobody interested in the field would recommend to you to read. And the advisor you select from that basis is somebody who nobody who is concerned about these issues would advise you to have. This is, in its own way, as troubling as anything you've got with Steve Bannon. It may be more familiar, it may be less shocking to some of the prejudices of people who cover politics, but it is really alarming all the same. 

Let me just push back for a minute. I'm not sure there's a narrative that if Steve Bannon is out, everything is going to be OK. I think there is clearly some who want his influence marginalized and, obviously, it has been. With regard to Jared Kushner, saying he doesn't know anything, I'm not speaking on Jared Kushner's behalf, but clearly he's accumulated some level of trust and confidence and knowledge inside the White House to obtain positions that he has with the president. If we then appreciate that Jared Kushner's in the spot he's in, and because the president takes family so seriously, he's not going anywhere, in your estimation if you're prescribing something for this White House beyond what's in this article, are you telling the president then to limit his portfolio? 

I would say that if Jared Kushner were truly a public spirited person, what he would do, if he wants to stay in the White House, obviously he has to separate himself much more fully from his own business interests than he has. Then he would say to the president that you need an A-team here. And what I would like to do for you is run a staffing process whereby instead of giving your China portfolio to me, and the Middle East portfolio to me, and the reinventing government portfolio to me, we bring in people who actually knew about these issues before November of last year. You have the whole world of talent available to you. So let's run a proper staffing process and let's bring proper people into the White House. And, by the way, let's also get the State Department staffed while we are at it, and some of the other departments, too, where there are no deputies. You know, the White House, as all of us know, the bureaucratic process in the White House depends on deputies meetings where the next level down prepares the issues for the principals. You can't have deputies meetings if you don't have deputies, and halfway through, or a third of the way through the president's first year, no deputies. 

That
