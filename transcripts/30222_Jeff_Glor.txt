Thank you. 

We continue this evening with a look at new policy on drone strikes. President Trump has reportedly loosened Obama era restrictions applicable to targeted killings outside active war zones. The changes give greater autonomy to the CIA and the pentagon to conduct counterterrorism operations. Joining me now from Washington is Greg Jaffe of the Washington Post and Gordon Lubold of the Wall Street Journal. I'm pleased to welcome them both to this program. Gordon, let me start with you. What is new about this and why is the White House doing this? 

Mr. Trump visit the CIA that first day after being inaugurated and got briefed. And I think, then, soon thereabouts provided essentially an informal authority to the CIA to return to these -- to continue to conduct drone strikes, which they had heretofore not been doing under the Obama Administration, at least in its later years. So what the authority was, was to give the CIA permission to conduct strikes, in particular, in Syria. We have some evidence that suggests that they've also done one in Pakistan as well. But then we saw in Syria about four or five -- three weeks ago, they targeted an Al-Qaeda leader in northern Syria. So that was kind of the first known example of the CIA's taking this authority since they got it from Mr. Trump. 

And so, but, Gordon, there has long been the sort of feisty turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon over drone strikes. 

Right. So there's always been this kind of bureaucratic squabbling over this issue. Under pressure from human rights groups and others, Mr. Obama had kind of settled on getting the kind of hybrid solution, where the CIA and the DOD work together to mount a strike. So it's basically the CIA providing the intelligence and the analysis, and then at the last minute, allowing the DOD to essentially pull the trigger, but thus, allowing that mission to be largely publicly accountable and transparent. And that was a place where Mr. Obama had pushed to have that happen, so now this is the beginning of what could be a reversal of that policy under Mr. Trump, who has clearly signaled that he wants to kind of accelerate the fight against Islamic state and other groups. 

And, Greg, how easy or complicated is it going to be to change the drone rules? 

You know, I think it's relatively easy. They were presidential policy guidance, so it was guidance that President Obama set down that he was hoping to set a standard that would tie the hands of the successor a little bit. But there's no legal mandate that President Trump has to follow those rules. 

Greg, so what was the Obama Administration worried about that the Trump Administration may not be worried about. 

You know, I think the big thing President Obama was worried about was that you have this incredibly powerful tool that allows you to launch strikes anywhere in the world at very low cost to U.S. personnel, and very low cost to taxpayer dollars, and so he wanted some sort of set of rules, particularly outside of active combat areas, that would set a threshold for these strikes. You know, if you're going to use American power to kill somebody, he wanted to make sure that it was absolutely necessary. 

President Obama was not always shy about using that power. 

No, he wasn't. And, in fact, he used it very heavily early in his administration. And so it's around 2013 where he looks at it and thinks, gosh, the technology has really accelerated. His administration was using it quite heavily and felt like, hey, we need to put some rules on the road in place to govern this. 

Gordon, can you talk about more of that technology acceleration and how much better the drone technology has become and how quickly it advances and how easy it can be for the military to rely on this. 

Right. I mean, Greg's right, I mean, if you came home with an addictive tool for the Obama Administration, which was low to send troops into harm's way but you could do this kind of antiseptically. You know, the technology's gotten better. The number of drones, although they're still under high demand by the military, are more plentiful and, you know, U.S. Government has eyes in the sky in all these places. Military commanders will say they never have quite enough. But it is an effective way to conduct counterterrorism operations from the sky and without getting, you know, U.S. troops' feet wet in that sense. I think, you know, we see Mr. Trump wanting to accelerate this fight and thinking this is an easy and good way to do it. But why not bring the CIA back into it so you have essentially both agencies kind of working more closely on this fight. 

Gordon, so can you talk more about how these decisions are made. 

Well, you know, under the Obama Administration, decisions were kept at a very high level. And if you talk to military folks, sometimes they expressed frustration at what they would be perceive, in some cases, as micromanagement by the Obama White House in terms of deciding whether a target vetted, you know, to what degree a target should be vetted. And in some cases, you know, in the case of one target they had in Libya, I think in 2015, it took like eight months to get the decision to green light for that particular operation. So we're seeing, on the military side, Mr. Trump's interest in delegating a lot of that authority down anyway, and now we're seeing, potentially, the camel's nose in the tent with the CIA. The two agencies do have different vetting thresholds, and the CIA's is higher, and this is not in terms of civilian casualties, but just in terms of deciding a certain target is the actual target they're after. CIA's is higher than the military's for different reasons, but it's also just kind of driven by culture of both places being significantly different when comes to doing this. And so what the military would tell you is, is that using their drones by the way, the CIA's use -- you know, these are military drones they're using -- they can take sometimes months to decide and conclude on a target and execute that target, whereas the Defense Department, which is designed to kind of be more results oriented, whatever, could maybe execute that target a lot sooner. So there's a disparity in the thresholds that's going to come into play as they decide how this new authority expands or not. 

So, Greg, the CIA would argue that they're more effective at these strikes. 

Yeah, that certainly was the argument that they made, particularly in Pakistan where they have been operating for a period. You know, you get to know the area and the terrain and the people. In Yemen, for a while, both the CIA and military, I think, were taking drone strikes. And there was a perception, I think in the White House and elsewhere, that the CIA had become better at it because they had been doing for longer. I think the military, in some cases, would push back on the notion. 

Greg, on the broader point here, Sean Spicer addressed ISIS in the briefing, at least yesterday, and a lot of this information is kept under wraps or hasn't been released because they say they don't want those the administration is fighting to figure out what's going on here exactly. But beyond drone strikes, the overall strategy, what more do we know or have we learned from the first month-plus in office for the new administration? 

You know, I think so far we haven't seen major changes. You know, it's still very much sort of what they call the Obama Administration and what, the military calls a by with and through strategy. In other words, we're not going to commit large number of U.S. troops to direct combat. We're going to work through indigenous allies on the ground. And that's largely what's been done in both Iraq and Syria. I think you see a small change in that, you know, there's more -- commanders are being allowed to take more risk in term of pushing U.S. advisors further forward on the battlefield, a little bit more artillery support on the ground, but just not major shifts. 

Gordon, if we see more troops on the ground, where will it be? 

I think largely what a lot of the commanders are going to say, that they need more advisors. We know that in Afghanistan that they would like more advisors, and that is probably going to be likely true in Iraq and Syria. Potentially more combat forces. Greg's right that there's more openness to exposing the military, which are deployed to these places, to more risk, and so you may have, you know, a higher number of Special Forces say, "Go into Syria." We've already seen conventional forces going in there. Because I think that you can't overhaul this whole strategy. It's going to stay the way it really was under Obama, but you can tweak it by adding more troops here and there and just kind of turning it up a little bit. But I think Mr. Trump is probably learning that, you know, there's not a magic bullet to just kind of make this thing happen a lot quicker than it was happening already. 

But, Gordon, the notion of advisors has always been an interesting term; right? 

Well, right, because you could kind of drive a truck through the definition of what an advisor does, and you can also, you know, advisors up to now were supposed to stay far away from actual combat, and they had this kind of weird term of art of, you know, one terrain feature behind the frontline. This has been blurred anyway, even under Mr. Obama, and it was always hard because a lot of journalists like us can't get in and embed with these guys to see what they're actually doing. So it was already blurry. I think it's going to become blurrier. The question will be whether the Trump Administration wants to be more open about what it is the troops are doing. I think Mr. Trump would like to kind of keep most of what the military does under wraps. I don't think we're going to have an embedded media program or whatever, and it's going to be hard to assess what they're doing. But definitely the advising can be a euphemism for just almost actual combat for the U.S. troops. 

Already making it harder to assess what the State Department is doing, and no indications that it's happening on the military side as well. Greg Jaffe from the Washington Post and Gordon Lubold from the Wall Street Journal, thank you both very much. 

Thank you. 

Thanks.
