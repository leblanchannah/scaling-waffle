Would they have the votes or not? That was the question in Washington all week long. President Trump insisted House of Representatives vote at 3:30 this afternoon on the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, but at the last minute, the president told Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, to pull the bill. Mike Allen joins me now from Washington, where he has been tracking the story. He is the co-founder of the news service Axios and the editor of the "Axios AM Newsletter. Mike, let me begin with what some might say, an assessment, others might say an autopsy. What happened? 

Well Charlie, we had epic miscalculations at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue from beginning to end. So President Trump, beginning -- we're seeing in "The New York Times" that he decided to go ahead with health care, to plunge ahead with health care rather than taking up the, perhaps, easier win of tax reform almost on a lark, in a very quick conversation where he didn't really delve into the pluses and minuses. At the other end of the Pennsylvania Avenue, at the beginning, Speaker Ryan, looking at this more from a matter of policy than politics. Charlie, when you talk to House leadership about how rough this looked for the different parts of their conference, they would always retreat to policy answers, when in the end, Charlie, this came down to pure raw politics, person to person, miscalculation at the end. So, Charlie, Axios is told that until the very end, people thought it would be nip and tuck, looked very close. They just were hoping they would limp over the line, but in fact, the bottom fell out. The numbers were going to be terrible and that's, in the end, why they reversed their course and pulled the bill instead of having a vote. The thinking in the White House, Charlie, had been to go and have the vote even if you lose, and the calculation was that, say you tried, that you blamed Democrats, and if you're the more Machiavellian members of the White House team, you then have a list of who's with you and who's against you. You have a list of what Republicans weren't being helpful. That was appealing to the White House. Here's where they were wrong, Charlie. They were looking at this as a vote unto itself. But life is not a series of one-offs. Charlie, as you know, life is a story. Life is a tapestry. Whatever happened today is going to have huge consequences for the rest of the Trump agenda. That is the big takeaway from today, Charlie, is that, now everything else will be harder. Tax reform, and eventually infrastructure, and whatever they want to do on immigration, just among Republicans, there isn't trust, there is not appetite, there is not sea legs, there is not confidence that Ryan can deliver, and it makes anything that they want to do more complicated and is going to cause them to have to pull in the sites of their ambition. 

And does it mean that members of Congress and members of the Republican Party, and certainly members of the Freedom Caucus are not afraid of the president? 

Well, that's true and the fact that that's been true for a while is part of this. So, Charlie, you and I have talked about how President Trump, because of the way he was elected, had a very powerful tool, and that is the digital bully pulpit, in a way that no other president has. He could use his Twitter feed and his direct communication to lobby and punish and stroke individual members. But it looks like the president focused on the member-to-member, individual part of this fairly late, and we were talking about how there must have been a lot of trips in the last -- a lot of invitations to Mar-a-Lago, and, So, do you golf? But you would have thought that would've been happening sooner. So the president wasn't directly engaged with these members, and at the same time, he was getting less popular. This is where he is paying the check for some of the distractions that you and I have been covering over these weeks and months. So not only were they not afraid of him, they weren't as aligned with him. Here's the twist in what happened is that there is an argument that, for the politics of 2018, for the politics of 2020, Republicans actually may be better off. The reason that they had so much trouble figuring out how to work this Rubik's cube is the politics of it back home for these members were terrible. Whichever way these members went, they were going to have a problem back home. After campaigning on this for seven years, after taking repeated votes to get rid of Obamacare, they needed to try. But, Charlie, and this is something that you don't very often hear talked about in the Acela Corridor between us and Washington and you in New York, but the real-world effects of this bill were very worrisome to a lot of members of Congress and should have been worrisome to the White House. Charlie, you've covered how much of the Trump coalition, some of the struggling, hard-working Americans who are having a rough time were dependent on Obamacare. A lot of them either needed parts of the Obamacare program, or people that they love were involved with that. And, so, the effect of it hadn't really kicked in and was going to take a while to all kick in. But Republicans may be better off being able to blame Obama, blame Democrats and not own the health care system which, under the best circumstances, was not going to get better overnight and, under this bill, would have given them a lot of explaining to do. 

What does it say about Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, other than he has some of the same problems that John Boehner had? 

Yeah, so a great Tweet said, somewhere John Boehner is sipping a glass of merlot. (LAUGHTER) It's harder than it looks, isn't it, young man? There is no question about that. And this marriage between the Speaker and the President, as you know, was always going to be an arranged and difficult marriage. Then, at the end, when they were in such different places, the White House clearly was planning to take credit if this passed and blame Paul Ryan if it didn't, and the president trying to bully, frankly, the Speaker at the end, telling him to go ahead and take this vote, the president thinking of it in classic deal terms, and that is, on Wall Street, deals die again and again before they're finally done, and, so, the gamble was, you go ahead and get this vote and eventually you're going to be better off. The Speaker saw his support evaporating and knew that that wasn't going to be the case. So, Charlie, the Republicans are now saying that they're going to move on, that they're not going to try and fix this on Monday morning, they're not going to retake this up. Plunging into tax reform this morning at an Axios News Shapers event, I had a conversation with the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, his first on-stage interview. And we talked about tax reform and he was arguing that in some ways, tax reform is simpler than healthcare, and I said, you talk to anybody who was around here in 1986, I think you will get some skeptics on that because he is arguing that tax reform is goodies and, yes, tax reform has goodies in it, but there also are people who lose out on the other end. So now we're plunging into another completely politically-fraught argument, something, again, where, on policy, White House, House, Senate, all in slightly different places, Speaker Ryan insistent on moving ahead with this border adjustment tax, which makes it more expensive to bring goods into the country and could raise a trillion dollars that could be used for tax relief elsewhere, but that makes things cost more at Walmart. If you're a senator from Arkansas, like, that is not a very tough decision. I asked Steve Mnuchin today about the border adjustment tax and I said to him, let's say I work at Walmart, let's say I shop at Walmart, which I do, explain to me why a border adjustment tax is good for me. And you saw in his answer that there was no particular embrace of it by the White House. So why that is important, Charlie, and these packages always come and go, as you know, but the White House already is in a very different place than the House, and in the tax code where a break for one person is an egregious outrage for another, trying to work that tetris after this last experience, very hard. 

I think this week will show President Trump is facing collision of some of his campaign promises. They are in direct collision with each other and some of the things he promised he can't deliver because it affects some other things he promised. 

That's a very brilliant point, and it's like why you couldn't make the math work on health care, that for every single change you made that made it more palatable to conservatives, you not only made it less palatable to moderates, people in tough districts, the few people in swing districts, but you made it less likely to pass the Senate, more likely that these members were, in the very vivid, memorable words of Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas: "walking the plank," taking a tough vote for something that had no chance of becoming law and that is why there was so much pressure on the Speaker in the last 12 hours. There was no way that his members wanted him to have to take a vote that clearly was going to go down or was going to go nowhere. So you're right about this collision, Charlie, not only within the issues but among the issues. 

Michael, thank you so much. 

Treat to be on, happy weekend, Charlie. 

We'll be right back. Stay with us.
