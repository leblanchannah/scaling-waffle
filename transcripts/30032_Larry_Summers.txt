Ian Bremmer:Good evening. I'm Ian Bremmer sitting in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with the economy. President Trump will seek to boost defense spending by $54 billion in his proposed budget plan for 2018. The 10 percent increase is set to be counter balanced by spending cuts from other federal agencies including the EPA and the State Department. The proposal expected to be released in March does not plan to change social security and Medicare. All this and more concerning the U.S. economy will be the focus of President Trump's primetime address to Congress on Tuesday. Joining me now from Massachusetts is Larry Summers. He is a professor at Harvard and its former president. Of course, he also served as treasury secretary under President Clinton, and as director of President Obama's national economic council. I'm pleased to have him on this program. Welcome, Larry, glad that you are with me. 

Larry Summers:Good to be with you, Ian. 

Ian Bremmer:So, you heard the headlines as I have. We've got a big increase in defense spending. Everything else that can be pulled back is going to be pulled back. And budget numbers, at least for growth for 2017, not three to four percent as they've been talking about. How does this strike all of you from Harvard? 

Larry Summers:Well, I won't speak for Harvard. The numbers on the budget, the economic forecast is optimistic but not as ludacris as some feared. Raising the defense budget I think is probably a prudent investment in a dangerous world. Seeking to combine that with massive tax cuts, I think means untenable cuts in other parts of the budget. Look, we've got more people in the United States who are in military bands than we do who are in the entire Foreign Service. In a world where our ability to get along with other countries, our ability to run effective counselor offices is essential to controlling immigration, something the president has talked about, these kinds of slashing of the budget for diplomacy I think is very dangerous. We haven't seen, and it's no accident, what the plans are for domestic budgeting. But, you know, people in his world have talked about a two-thirds cut in the number of employees at the EPA. Anything like that, approaching that would mean the degradation of environmental regulation to the point where tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people would die each year of pollution. We haven't seen the budget plans for other agencies, but what kind of civilization are we going to be if as rumors have it, the federal government zeros out funding for the arts, funding for our culture. So I think this is a budget that is going to be unrealistic to execute and dangerous in terms of the civility and generosity of our society, if it were to pass through the congress. But I think it's very, very unlikely. There's a long history of presidents proposing vague huge cuts in the discretionary budget and then not being able to achieve them. My guess is that at the end of the day, he won't get all the tax cuts he wants. He certainly shouldn't get all the tax cuts that he wants. And that he won't get discretionary spending cuts that he wants either. I, unlike many people who I agree with on many issues think that some increase in the defense budget probably is a prudent thing. 

Ian Bremmer:And market response so far has been these guys are geniuses, right? I mean, we're at records in the United States. And everybody likes the regulatory pullback. Everybody thinks, you know, this is stimulative in terms of taxation and infrastructure. Do you think that the markets are wildly ahead of themselves? And I saw Warren Buffett just a few hours ago saying, actually no, he's still very bullish on the U.S. market right now. 

Larry Summers:Look, I think people have a tendency to make a mistake and look at markets and think of them as only being driven by what's happening in Washington. There are a lot of things happening in the economy that influence markets, and so it wouldn't attribute it all to any kind of reaction entirely to President Trump. My sense is that markets may have a bit of a sugar high going. I don't expect tax cuts of the magnitude that most businessmen seem to be looking for to in fact materialize. I think there are much greater risks to the health of the economy from the protectionist policies that the administration may pursue, than many others perceive. I think there's much more uncertainty being created by the president's proclivity to policy making by Tweet, and dealing in terms of one-off ad hoc arrangements with particular companies. And I'm not sure just how much is going to materialize in the regulatory area. So, I have a sense that there may be a bit of a sugar high going, but that doesn't mean -- that doesn't translate for me into some kind of near term economic forecast. And I certainly wouldn't be one of those who's confidently forecasting a crash. But I think many people are seeing increases in fundamental value that don't seem likely to me to materialize as I watch the political process, think about how Congress is likely to act. And I think there are real risks to where we're getting, vis-a-vis the rest of the world, that in a world where 40 percent of the profits of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 come from abroad, I think those issues loom pretty large, and should loom pretty large in thinking about the stock market value of companies here. 

Ian Bremmer:So talk about a couple of the big sort of announcements made by Steve Bannon on strategy. We've heard him talk about dismantling the administrative state. Also talk about economic nationalism, you know, sort of certainly a big departure from where the U.S. government has been going. Let me address the last one first. So, on the administrative state, I mean, do you see regulatory pieces in the United States that are just vastly greater than they need to be? Do you think, for example, Dodd-Frank needs to be taken apart? Where would you constructively head if that was your agenda right now? 

Larry Summers:Look, are there excesses in the regulation of community banks? Yes. Is there more bureaucratization than would be ideal in the regulation of all financial institutions caused by Dodd-Frank? Quite possibly there are. On the other hand, the president's chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, asserted the other day that Dodd-Frank cost hundreds of billions of dollars. I've asked repeatedly for some backup, some documentation, some support for that claim coming from the president's chief economic advisor, at a time when the total profits of all the banks are less than $200 billion. No response. In the same interview, Cohn talked about how we allow people to eat unsafe foods, don't we? As some kind of analogy suggesting that we should dismantle the consumer financial protection bureau. I see the things that are done in credit arrangements to take advantage of unsuspecting people, and it would take too long to explain them in detail to your viewers, but they are unconscionable. And there is much more that needs to be done to assure the proper provision of consumer credit, and the unsuspecting people are not stolen from by major financial institutions. So I think the idea that we should somehow be stripping away consumer financial regulation is cruel and is badly wrong. I look at what has happened to the water supply in Flint, Michigan, and in other places and I say to myself, do we need to be scaling back the efforts we make in this country around safe water? Do we want to go back to the days of the Los Angeles smog by scaling way back what the EPA does, or by trying to produce some kind of renaissance of the coil industry? This is very dangerous stuff. Pharmaceuticals are more powerful than they've ever been. That's a fantastic thing. We -- are there adjustments that need to be made? I've seen some situations where the FDA would do the country a service by accelerating the approval of drugs, particularly in situations where people are desperately ill. But should we, in some systematic way, set the stage for more thalidomides by scaling back pharmaceutical regulation? No, we absolutely shouldn't do that. And what I find so disturbing in the approach that the president is taking, and that many of those around the president are taking is not that they have views that are different from mine. I have views on most but not all issues go with Democratic administrations, others will differ. But that they seem to believe, they seem to take the concept of alternative facts seriously. 

Ian Bremmer:So how do you balance, on the one hand you have what certainly seems to be a set of policies that would more greatly empower the big corporations and the big banks. On the other hand, you have a president that seems to be focused very strongly on calling those very players out, saying that they're globalists and they're not focusing on the American worker. 

Larry Summers:One part of this is that this is a long tradition that we've seen in Latin America. Juan Peron in Argentina is perhaps a classic example. You reject all the experts. You declare yourself to be a tribune of the workers. And then once you're in power, you cut a set of deals to protect a whole set of moneyed interests who then support you, and then in various ways, perpetuate your power. That's a long tradition, and it often produces good results in the first few months because businesses get excited and have good animal spirits. But all you have to do is look at the economic history of Latin America to know that in the long run it's a passport to nowhere. And I think there's a lot of that that is going on. Then there's a separate issue which is these intermittent threats to companies like what the president did to the air conditioner company or what the president did about the price of Air Force One. And that stuff is symbolic. It is really small ball compared to the size of the economy. Look, take one example. He probably did delay or maybe even forestall the movement of 600 jobs to Mexico at Carrier. On the other hand, the shrill and destabilizing character, his rhetoric, has destabilized the Mexican peso by 15 percent or more, and that means that every business thinking about locating in Mexico or the United States now sees a 15 percent greater cost advantage to Mexico, relative to the day that he was elected. That's got to be a far larger threat to Ohio, or Indiana, or Pennsylvania, than whatever could be accomplished with those 600 jobs. So sure, he'll get some mileage out of these particular stories for a little while. But ultimately what's going to matter is conditions on the ground. But ultimately what the president is going to discover is that we live in a world of global supply chains, in which it's not that we import a product from abroad and just eat it or consume it here. It's that we import and then we process and then we add to it, and then there's further stages of processing abroad, and then it's brought back here and traded. And if we cut off imports we're going to cut ourselves out of that whole process. And there will still be global supply chains and we just won't be part of them. And that's the threat from the approach that the president is taking. 

Ian Bremmer:But there is a real bully pulpit here though, isn't there, Larry? It's not just a question of him calling a CEO on the carpet or tweeting against them. I mean, if he really truly wants to become a job creation president, doesn't the person who controls, in principle, how the American government is going to engage with corporations, the person who says the defense department is one of your biggest purchasers and so we're going to treat you differently unless you actually invest much more substantially. I recognize the numbers so far have been small. 

Larry Summers:I don't think so. I mean, he could influence his policies. He could propose a real program of infrastructure investment on a large scale, not a set of tax credits for pipelines that are already going to be built. But a real program of infrastructure investment, that would create a lot of jobs. He could pursue a serious set of regional policies directed at focusing federal efforts on areas with the highest employment. That would make a real difference. He could propose a set of effective wage subsidies directed at the categories of workers who are having the most difficulty. That would make a difference. But a bunch of meetings with CEO's where he bloviates about job creation? No, that will not, over time, have any appreciable effect on the level of job creation. That will serve to divert attention from the many issues the country faces, from rising mortality and decreasing health to crucial problems in education, to a genuinely decaying infrastructure that are going unaddressed. He may divert some attention from some national failings and failings of his administration, but I don't think there's any evidence to suggest that hectoring about job creation has effects at the level of the millions of jobs that you need to change if you're going to move the needle. 

Ian Bremmer:If you had to go back and look at what the Obama administration could have done significantly better, if you want to pick on one or two quick things that would have a more meaningful shot of actually persisting, what would they have been? 

Larry Summers:A country badly under invested in infrastructure during the years 2009 to 2016, but that wasn't because of the Obama administration. That was because the Congress was unwilling to support substantial increases in infrastructure investment. The country ran a tax system that created a big incentive for capital to stay abroad. But that was because the Congress wasn't willing to agree on a corporate tax reform that wasn't a major giveaway. Could the Obama administration have done more to promote business confidence? Yes. Would I have supported that, did I urge repeatedly that confidence is the cheapest form of stimulus? Yes, I did. But I think when you go back and look at the Obama administration, the big story, the thing that history will remember, is that everything on the day the president took office looked like it did right after 1929 when the stock market crashed. And while performance certainly could have been much better, it was nothing like the Great Depression. I think that will be remembered as a positive achievement. I think the concern right now is that a lot of things, starting with the stock market, are very much looking the way they did in March of the Herbert Hoover administration. And that was an administration that didn't work out so well for the economy. 

Ian Bremmer:Plenty of confidence right now in and around the administration. Larry, I'm sure we'll be talking about it. Thanks for joining me today. 

Larry Summers:Good to be with you.
