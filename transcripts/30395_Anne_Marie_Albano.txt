Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States. Research shows one in five young adults has experienced an anxiety disorder in the past year. The Youth Anxiety Center was founded in 2013 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. The doctors and researchers are studying the root causes of it and finding more effective interventions. Joining me now are three physicians in the field of youth anxiety. Dr. Anne Marie Albano of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr. Francis Lee of Weill Cornell Medicine, and Dr. John Walkup of Weill Cornell Medicine. I am pleased to have all of them at this table. Welcome. I'm stunned by this. I had no idea that youth anxiety was even a problem. I mean, you read about issues that happened because of different kinds of conflicts. But this is an epidemic almost. 

Well, it's out there. It's been out there for a long time. But fortunately, the Youth Anxiety Center and other programs like it, we're recognizing it more readily. we're getting outreach to people so that schools, colleges specifically, can pay attention. And the same thing with physicians in primary care who see a lot of these kids come into their offices, and can educate families about this problem. 

Tell me what we are talking about. 

You know, it's interesting. We knew about ADHD in the mid-1930s, we knew about depression about 30 or 40 years ago. But the evidence-base for the childhood onset anxiety disorders really came into publication in early 2009. So it's -- even though anxiety has been around for a long time, we kind of now know about the treatment and can really advocate for it. Most of the anxiety disorders begin in childhood between six and 12. And what we find is that many of the kids who are treated in the Youth Anxiety Center really never got earlier effective treatment, and as a result, lived with these conditions for a long time. And as a result, developed ongoing problems with coping and adaptation. And as they try and transition into adulthood, become more independent, they really struggle. And many of them fail. 

But tell me what we are talking about. Give me a classic example of youth anxiety. Because your center was only established in 2013. 

We've been working at this for a long time. As Dr. Walkup said, it was only in the 1983 edition, 1980 edition of the DSM, "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual," that we recognized childhood anxiety disorders. Previously, and even to this day, many physicians, many teachers think this is a phase. They tell parents wait it out. This is going to go away. But in actuality, anxiety does start by age four, the specific phobias are not merely fears that a child grows out of. And those diagnoses build upon each other, separation anxiety by six, generalized anxiety by 10, which is worry gone amok. Social phobia or social anxiety disorder runs throughout those ages and they add on to one another and they are gateway diagnoses. Every adult epidemiological study of mental illness in this country has shown anxiety in childhood predicts every mental health condition in adults. From bipolar disorder to schizophrenia, you name it. 

If you look at schizophrenia, if you look at bipolar, you can look back and see youth anxiety. 

You see anxiety in the back, right. 

So what can you do? 

So I think what the Youth Anxiety Center has done is it has set up a very unique system where you have -- center where you have basic neuroscientists with clinicians and physicians who will basically try to work together to focus on this question of -- and what's very interesting is that it is very rare for basic neuroscientists to be in the same center as with clinicians who are treating patients at the same time. And what it allows us to do is to do parallel studies, both clinical research and also basic research. And the basic research is mainly mouse models. Amazingly up until ten years ago, almost no one studied adolescent mice or rats. 

Does the treatment eliminate the anxiety? 

The treatments can be extraordinarily effective, I think especially if we get to them early. What youth anxiety is specializing in is the basic treatment of anxiety, but it also has to work with young people around all of the coping and adaptation difficulties that they have developed along the way. So it's a much more complicated treatment than when we deal with them in childhood, when we get to them in adolescence or young adulthood. 

And let me just say something. You just said something that many families come in, kids come in with, get rid of this anxiety for me. I can't take this anxiety. In fact, as Francis' work with basic science shows, anxiety is a normal natural emotion. We need anxiety. It motivates us, it protects us, gets us out of the way of danger, it tells us to study and so forth. 

What's the difference between that and what we are talking about? 

Well, this is exactly it. Avoidance sets in where kids will not do things that are challenging to them because it raises their anxiety, whether it is study for exams, walk into a classroom, advocate for a grade with a teacher or meet up with friends. They avoid things. Avoidance is really key, the more you avoid, the more your distress goes up because you find that, you know, you don't know how to cope. Then it interferes with your functioning. And what we see with these youth who are 18 to 28 years old is that they don't learn the basic social skills, negotiation skills, and other things that other kids on track are getting. 

Is there stigma? 

There's stigma mainly in the parents about what their kids are going through. Kids actually break down stigma pretty well. Once they get talking about it, and they recognize they have friends who have anxiety issues or ADHD issues or depression, it's actually our generation that is not doing the good job of breaking down stigma. 

Has social media exacerbated it? 

It hasn't helped in some ways. It has helped in many ways. There is a lot of cyber bullying that can occur that increases anxiety. And then of course how many likes you have and so on and so forth. It sets up competition and there's a lot of misinformation. One being we should get rid of anxiety rather than learn how to manage and deal with the anxiety. 

There's also, you know, people who are developing treatments that would work through iPads, through the computer, and so there -- 

Access information and therapy. 

Absolutely. And there are some kids who are so uncomfortable socially that their only social outlet, healthy social outlet is through media. So, you know, it's a mixed bag. It's a mixed bag for us. We like the positive parts. But there are some real negatives. 

How would a parent know that their child is suffering from anxiety? 

That's a fantastic question because kids will suffer two to seven years before the parent actually knows. And part of what we do is even though these are 18 to 28 year olds, we work with the family in this. Because what happens early in life is as the child is struggling with anxiety, the parent's natural tendency is to protect, comfort, reassure. But it draws them into the maintenance of the anxiety. Parent -- we have a lot of information for parents about letting your kids struggle early on so they develop some of the coping resources that they need to manage these kinds of symptoms. 

What about adults, do they have a lot of anxiety as well? 

Yes. 

Is it the same thing? 

It is but focused on different issues. I mean, it's in the social, in the work-related areas, and so forth. It's different ages and stages but still anxiety disorders run the gamut through life span. 

Is it treated mainly through -- what's the division of the medical school and the hospital that would treat anxiety? 

Child and adolescent psychiatry. We work with kids up to 18 but for the Youth Anxiety Center, we're interested in kids between 16 and 28. And we still think about some of them as kids because they have a childhood onset condition that really needs to be understood in that developmental context. 

Would you actually say that most of the adults who are 18 and above actually had anxiety disorder beforehand. 

That is my experience. It's just that they often go -- we didn't pay attention to it. We didn't think of it as serious. We thought of it as kind of a neurotic condition that might be managed just with kind of support or interest. 

Or thinking you'll grow out of it. 

That you'll grow out of it and it doesn't work that way. 

No one grows out of it? 

You don't, not out of a disorder. 

Right. 

And, you know, some of the data out there is nine percent of preschoolers have an anxiety disorder that is being managed as medical conditions -- headaches, stomachaches, things like that -- not for the anxiety itself. And a lot of times, a child might have OCD, social phobia, they're working around the academic decline or they're working around the family dysfunction that occurs, but not about the anxiety disorder itself. So we have to help families see, and therapists around the country see, we've got to get in there and work with the anxiety, within that youth and then also with the way the family is working with them. 

Is there a lot of research going on now in terms of understanding both the anxiety and how to deal with it? 

Yes, and most importantly, I think the biggest advance that the Youth Anxiety Center has made is that we've actually figured out that adolescent rats, mice, and humans are actually going through what we call a critical period which we had not known before, that it is actually a very special time in terms of the way that the brain develops. There is this one brain region called the prefrontal cortex that seems to not mature until the age of 23, for example. We all thought that this was linearly growing just sort of like just getting bigger and bigger. We actually know that now there are other parts of the brain that are hyper-connecting to it, and that we're actually using that knowledge. There is this one other brain region called the hippocampus that is very important for spatial memory and spatial learning, that seems to grow through adolescence through a very plastic period which makes it vulnerable, to, for example, things such as anxiety and trauma, but also gives us opportunities to actually do various things that stimulate the hippocampus. 

Plastic means it can regrow? 

It can regrow, it can reconnect, and for example, the best, one of the ways that Anne Marie and I are thinking about it is we are trying to develop therapies, for example, where you use certain types of modalities that stimulate the hippocampus, for example, like virtual reality where you actually do a virtual reality-based psychotherapy. So for example, someone is afraid of going to -- going flying, you wouldn't -- it is very hard to go to an airport these days. 

You put them in virtual reality and put the glasses on. 

Exactly. 

And they feel like they're flying. 

And if you did functional neuroimaging simultaneously, you would notice that the hippocampus is really lighting up during that period of time. What our research is suggesting is that actually adolescents are probably better at this type of learning that previously dangerous places are less dangerous if they are placed in these. This is what Anne Marie -- 

What is a previously thought of dangerous place? 

For example, inside an airplane or inside -- 

For kids, it is a classroom, right? We think about the classroom. For example, the vehicle for change in terms of psychotherapy comes from cognitive behavioral therapy. John and I were the co-leads of the largest trial that studied treatments for anxiety disorders in seven to 17 year olds. The combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy got the most kids 80 percent well. But the mono therapies, cognitive behavioral therapy by itself or medication also got a significant number of kids well. Exposure, if you have heard of exposure therapy, exposing the person to what they are afraid of is key and critical to this treatment. And with the work we learned of from Francis in terms of mice in the adolescent phase, you've got to make the context real for the kids. So the work we do, we bring our kids out into the world. They are on subways, they are in restaurants. We are taking them places to expose them to what they are afraid of. And then the virtual reality, we have a virtual dorm, a virtual classroom, a college classroom, a virtual party where they are actually in a scene that is challenging their fears for speaking and interacting with people. 

With all that you are learning through brain imaging and everything else, what are the big questions that remain unanswered? 

I would say that the big question is, first of all, how did we miss this? How did we not know that the brain was reorganizing during adolescence? The second thing is, we still don't know the molecular mechanism. What are the growth factors or other things that are actually leading to this? And if you could find those, as they found for critical periods for vision, then you could use them as potential targets whether they be behavioral interventions or even designing new drugs to, for example, open up critical periods, to, as you said, if someone has gone through seven or eight years of anxiety, then you would want to be able to make their hippocampus, for example, more plastic so then you can then do this type of treatment, where it not just -- so you have periods of time even after adolescence, as you said, for the adult with anxiety disorder. You would you actually want them to be able to treat it. 

What else is on the frontier beyond that? 

The number one question parents ask me, is, how long does my kid have to be on medicine? Yes. They ask a little bit about side effects. But once they make the decision, once they realize that anxiety is severe and impairing and understand the long-term context of that, they say well, okay, I agree, but how long? And we have no idea. We've tried a number of times to get this study funded. 

Are they worried about some kind of addiction or what are they worried about? 

I think what they are really worried about is they are making a commitment, remember between six and 12, to do an intensive form of psychotherapy but also medication management. And they want to know, is this a lifelong thing? Is this something that they could do for a year or two and kind of get on top of it and lick it, if you will? And we don't have really good data. We have strategies that we use, but we don't have great data about how to inform families about how long to treat.
