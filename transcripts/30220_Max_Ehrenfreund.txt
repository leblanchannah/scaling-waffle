Good evening. I'm Jeff Glor filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with a look at the GOP health-care bill. Yesterday the congressional Budget Office released its assessment of the House republican's health-care proposal, known as the American Healthcare Act. The report found that the bill would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over a decade but would also leave 24 million more Americans uninsured during that same period. The news will likely complicate the parties' efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Joining me now from Washington is Max Ehrenfreund of the Washington Post and Jim Tankersley of Vox. Welcome to both of you. And Max, let me start with you. The CBO report here has now had more than 24 hours to marinate in Washington. How is it sitting? 

Well it's not sitting especially well, to be quite honest. There are a number of moderate republican lawmakers whose votes will be very important for getting this bill passed who are worried about the fact that CBO projects, as you said, some 24 million more Americans could be uninsured at the end of a decade if it's enacted as planned. And that's definitely a concern for the republican leadership. On the other side, there are also some hard-line republicans are really concerned about the fact that although the bill does decrease the deficit by about $337 billion over ten years, that that's probably not enough for them, and they would like to see greater reduction in government borrowing. 

But, Max, the White House knew that the uninsured number was going to be a big number, which is why they started pushing back over the weekend. 

Yeah, I think that's exactly right. It wasn't necessarily a surprise that so many people are likely to become uninsured if this bill is enacted. Republicans have been saying for a long time that they want to reduce federal spending on health care, and health care isn't free, so if the spending is reduced, that implies that more Americans will have to pay more themselves or just go without. So that wasn't a surprise. But I do think that the CBO setting it down in black and white has made the issue a little bit more real for republicans. They're having to confront it now publicly. They're being asked about it by reporters, and probably their constituents as well, and so they're having to think about it in a way that perhaps they didn't before. 

Jim, this is a challenging thing; right, taking on the CBO the nonpartisan CBO, which is headed by a conservative economist, a hand picked by republicans. This is would seem to be a tough row to hoe. 

Yeah, it's a little bit like arguing with the refs in a basketball game. You can make cases on the margins that they're doing things that are not what you would have done, that you would not have call it had fouls that way. But at the end of the day, they are the arbiters of Washington, and have been for a long time. So republicans have had several strategies, it appears, for how they're going to counter this. The White House has sort of tried to undermine the credibility of CBO. Paul Ryan talked about how this is not as bad of a score as he was expecting. There are a bunch of different reactions, but they all boil down to the fact is they're reckoning not so much with an analysis, a particular analysis from CBO, but with a reality of lost coverage. Whether you think it's going to be 24 million or 20 million or however you want to slice it whether other analyses they might produce, the White House might produce its own, for example, they have to reckon with the real possibility here, the very likelihood that Donald Trump is not going to make good on his promise to ensure more people, not fewer, and that is the central problem that we're into. 

Jim, we should point out, the CBO has always had a very tough time predicting what's going to happen in the future. 

Well, sure. As we all do. But health care is actually, to get a little bit nerdy about this, health care is particularly tricky to model, and the CBO was wrong about certain ways that individuals, companies, and marketplaces would react to the Affordable Care Act after it was passed. That said, CBO did a better job than pretty much anybody in getting in the ballpark on that. So, again, I don't think we should treat 24 million as a hard fast, this is absolutely what's going to happen, number, but we should consider that to be, you know, part of a range, a point in a range of possibilities, all of which look very bad for republicans as they try to push a bill that they say is going to improve access, not restrict it. 

And, Max, as that push continues, Paul Ryan wants to do it quickly. The President wanted to do it quickly. Right now it doesn't seem like it's going to happen quickly. 

No, I don't think so. There have also been requests from some of it have senate, especially Senator Tom Cotton, a republican, who have asked the leadership in the house to, you know, slow things down and try to take another crack at the baseball here to address some of the concerns that CBO has raised. But I think Jim's point is a good one. It's very difficult to see how republicans will be able to revise this bill to avoid the fact that, you know, millions of Americans would become uninsured under the republican plan. It's part of what republicans are trying to do, which is reduce the role of government in the health-care sector, one of the most important sectors of the economy. And when it happens, it seems very likely that more people will be uninsured. 

Jim, who wins if a bill like this moves forward? 

Well there are a few big winners. Obviously the wealthy are the biggest winner, because there's a lot of tax cuts for them in this bill. One way you can look at it is this is a bill that reduces taxes, mostly on the rich, by about $600 million over a decade and funds that, more than funds that, by reducing spending on the poor. So if you're rich you're going to pay lower taxes, and you didn't really need government buying health care anyway. The sneaky other winner in this, though, are upper middle class Americans, people who made too much money, like if you're an individual, like from $50,000 to $75,000 a year, you weren't getting help from Obama Care to buy health insurance. Well you actually are going to get help from this bill. CBO pointed out in the score. So while that help will decline over time, in terms of how far it goes to help you buy health care, it still is something in there for a group that I don't think we thought was going to be a big winner in this plan. 

Max, Sean Spicer today talked about this being one of three prongs when it comes to trying to get the health-care legislation through, or repeal and replace. What are the other prongs that we're talking about here? 

The two other prongs that Sean Spicer is referring to are, first, the possibility for regulatory action by the Trump Administration, not to change the law, but to change the way that the current law is implemented and try to move the health-care system in a more market-oriented direction. That's what they're planning to do. And then the third prong is republicans are saying that somehow they're going to come up with 60 votes in the senate and move a bipartisan bill that will address some of the more technical questions in health care legislation that do not directly relate to the budget or the deficit, and, thus, are subject to a democratic filibuster. Now Senator Cotton, who I mentioned earlier, had a very good response to this. He pointed out that it seems very unlikely that republicans will be able to get the 60 votes they need in senate to pursue that third prong without a filibuster. And then on the second prong, we'll have to wait and see what the courts say, because it's likely that democrats will seek to move back against whatever the Trump Administration is doing through the judiciary. 

And whether it's Tom Cotton or Rand Paul, was the White House expecting this senate resistance? 

That's a good question. I think they certainly should have been expecting it. Certainly the intent of republicans in repealing the Affordable Care Act, the kind of system that they wanted, has been clear for a long time. Republicans described their plans in a whitepaper over the summer that speaker Ryan and some of these colleagues in the House put together. And so it's always been clear that what the republicans have hoped to do. And it's always been clear that some republicans would not like that plan, and this is not necessarily a plan that would easily unite the party. Perhaps, you know, republicans have spent a lot of time, especially President Trump and his allies have spent a lot of time saying this process of repeal will be easy, and perhaps, to some degree, they started to believe their own rhetoric on that point. But it's just never been true. 

And, Jim, can you talk about the dynamic right now between Paul Ryan, who is trying to lead this and trying to convince folks in the senate to go along, both that relationship and the continuing and long and interesting relationship between the speaker and the President. 

The speaker of the house has not been a particularly attractive job in Washington for quite a while now, and I think we're seeing why at the moment. Paul Ryan is caught between several different political forces. On one hand you have, like what Max mentioned, the Tom Cottons and Ted Cruz' of the world who are very concerned that this bill is not conservative enough, that it's not doing enough to enact these market-based solutions that conservatives really believe will help Americans buy health care for themselves. On the other hand, you have a whole bunch of senators in particular, and some moderate republicans in the house, who are worried about these big coverage losses that have been highlighted by CBO. And who will probably push for more ways to guard against that sort of coverage loss, which then makes the conservatives, the more conservative members even more upset. And then you have the President who has promised a bunch of things that are, frankly, not possible to deliver all at once, given the bill that he is starting with. So you have Donald Trump's big plans that everyone's going to pay less for health care and everyone's going to be covered, and you have two very different ways of looking at that in the house and in the senate, and Paul Ryan is stuck trying to make all of that into a bill that can pass, and not just pass, but be something that republicans can defend and be proud of going into future elections. 

Do we have a sense right now, Jim, of how similar this bill is to what Paul Ryan was dreaming of, say, a few years ago? 

I think there's some big differences between this and what Paul Ryan is dreaming of. I think the real reasons for that is because this is going through that reconciliation process to try to avoid a filibuster. Look, what republicans really would like, and particularly the party base, and what Paul Ryan, as an adherent of free-market philosophy, really believes in is an idea of really getting the government out of health care, creating more competition, allowing insurers to sell new and different kind of products, and so that basically every American who wants it can afford to buy health care to some degree. The idea that the market will solve the problem, this bill doesn't really do that to anywhere near the extent that I think Paul Ryan or other conservatives would like if they didn't have to run through that little hoop to avoid the filibuster. 

Max, Jim talks about reconciliation, and you wrote about the challenges that republicans have with reconciliation. 

Yeah, that's right. And in that respect, the CBO score that was published Monday did give republicans an important reason to breathe a sigh of relief. I mean, if the CBO had said this bill is going to increase the deficit, if this bill is going to force the government to borrow more money, then it seems that the bill would have been subject to a democratic filibuster in the senate, and basically the whole project would have ended at that point. Instead, the CBO said that this bill is likely to save the government some money, about $30 billion a year, or so, and as a result of that, republicans can move ahead with their plan to avoid a filibuster. But as we have been discussing, there are still some serious challenges. 

Jim, what happens next? 

What happens next is a budget markup, a big hearing in the House on Wednesday, where they're going to just keep moving this thing forward in the House. Let's stop and appreciate just how fast this bill is moving for something that doesn't appear to have, from the outside, a ton of grass roots support and does not have a lot of interest groups or big players in Washington behind it. But what it does have is the leadership in congress and, it appears, the force, to some degree, of the Presidency. So it's going to keep moving through congress. Eventually it will come to a floor vote, and then we'll start to see, I think, the really big challenges. Can they keep enough of the freedom caucus, the most conservative members in the house to get it through there? If they do kick it to the senate, it will almost certainly have to change fairly dramatically to try to get through the senate. And then what happens, these are high hurdles, but they start with just keeping it moving as quickly as republicans can towards some sort of legislative outcome. 

Max, one of the President's big selling points here in the campaign was the deal-making, right? How much of this -- what is his role right now? Is this a light touch or heavy touch behind the scenes? 

From what we understand, it's a light touch, and it's very much behind the scenes. I note that when the speaker, Paul Ryan, went to his home state of Wisconsin to announce the bill last week, President Trump did not go with him. Instead, it was Vice President Pence. And I think that some people in the White House, I'm not sure of this, but it does seem as though perhaps some people in the White House are wary of associating Trump too closely with a bill that could very well fail ultimately. And so we've heard that Trump is meeting with conservative lawmakers. He is trying to get them on board with this project, and so far at least, we're not sure if that effort will be successful on Trump's part. We're not sure if he'll be able to deliver on being the deal maker that he said he was during the campaign. 

Because it was tagged Obama care, and President Obama came to embrace that, eventually, term, he said. But now it's Trump Care. 

That's right. That's right. And today Sean Spicer, the Press Secretary, said that Trump did not want this bill to be called Trump Care, which does raise the question of how seriously Trump is supporting it publicly or behind the scenes. 

All right. Max Ehrenfreund of the Washington Post, and Jim Tankersley of Vox, thank you both very much. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
