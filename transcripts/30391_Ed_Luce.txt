Good evening. I'm Jeff Glor filling in for Charlie Rose who is away today. We begin with news out of the United Kingdom. In a surprising development, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May declared that said she would call an early general election on June 8th. The move reflects an apparent effort to give the prime minister more flexibility in pending negotiations to exit the European Union, or Brexit. It's also a sudden reversal for May's previous position that the country needed time to ensure stability with the issues it's facing. The House of Commons will vote on Wednesday whether to approve the election. Joining me in New York is John Micklethwait, he's editor-in-chief of Bloomberg; and from Washington, Ed Luce, he's chief U.S. columnist and commentator for the "Financial Times". Welcome to both of you. To the latest chapter in the soap opera that is Brexit. Ed, let me start with you quickly, how surprising is this? 

It is quite surprising. This is the best-kept secret in British politics. If it had been David Cameron or Tony Blair planning to call a snap election, it would have been leaked out. And they had so many friends, David Cameron had a chumocracy, that it would have been hard to keep a secret. Theresa May is a very different kind of character. Doesn't reveal her hand and has executed a complete surprise to almost everybody except a very small coterie around her. It's no surprise, in another sense, in that, she doesn't have her own mandate. She became Prime Minister having been a reluctant Remainer, but she did campaign for Remain. She was probably where most -- many British people were, which is in the E.U. with her head but out of it with her heart. So she was therefore not seen as one of the true Brexiteers who were out of the E.U. with their heads and hearts. And if she now gets her own big mandate, big majority on June 8th, and indeed increases the slim conservative majority, she can then claim her own authority to pursue Brexit negotiations her own way. And that gives her independent standing that she's hitherto lacked. So in that sense, it's not a surprise, but it was a brilliantly kept secret. 

Which is what I was going to say to John, fundamentally, which is why she's doing this. 

Yes, there's a strong element of self-interest in this. I know she will characteristically say this is on behalf of the country and the country needs to back some version of Brexit, but she's definitely doing it with that in mind. The interesting thing, as Ed points out, is that her starting point, she has slim Tory majority. The thing which is unclear is whether she ends up with a bigger Tory majority, which is what we all think will probably happen. But, yet again, we could all be wrong. But assuming that does happen, that should be good for her because it should give her more stability, give her the ability to get things through Parliament easier if she wants. But sometimes having large groups of people means your chances of keeping them all in order are much smaller because you can't appeal to the tribal loyalty. And the underlying problem with this is the Tories and Europe, where the Tories have the same sort of approach to Europe as maybe the Republican Party here does to abortionists. It's all about the internal politics, the Tory party. And what MP's, many MP's think their main danger is of being deselected by their local party rather than being beaten by the Labor party. 

But as you say, what we've expected might happen has not always happened, whether it's -- 

Even people as clever as Ed and me have got this completely wrong repeatedly. 

So if we talk about June and the opposite of what you mentioned might happen does happen, what position does that put -- does Theresa May put herself in? 

I think Theresa May basically is -- at the moment, she's in a position where she doesn't have much -- she has a tiny majority, she still keeps on with a tiny majority, and that would not look good. The main other problem she's trying to do is play with time a bit because what's happening in continental Europe -- who are the other side of the big negotiation about Brexit -- you have the French election, but the French election isn't just the presidential bit, you then got the parliamentary bit after that. You've got Merkel's election. You've got August, which, as we all know is not a period where there's much work done. So she has this period that she declared Brexit or started the process. But for the next few months nothing's been happening. So in a strange way she's going back, she hopes, to replenish her sort of political supplies. 

Ed, the conservatives do have a significant amount of support, as you know, in the polls today. Is there a sense that has continued to surge? 

That's not clear. I mean, there's one party in Britain, the Liberal Democrats and only one that unambiguously wants a second referendum to reverse Brexit, and that's what they will campaign on. And Tony Blair, who's of course a former labor prime minister has indicated today that he'll probably campaign with the liberal Democratic Party. As John mentioned, polls in Britain, although they show a 20 point conservative lead which is prohibitive and overwhelming, although they show that huge lead, polls have got British elections wrong quite a lot recently, not just Brexit where a narrow Remain victory was indicated by the polls, but much more egregiously, the last general election in Britain two years ago in which labor was shown as being neck and neck with the conservatives, and labor was absolutely obliterated on the day. So it's a very volatile picture. John mentioned France. You know, Jean-Luc Melanchon, the far left French leader who could be compared possibly to Jeremy Corbyn, the shambolic Labor party leader. Melanchon was nowhere three or four weeks ago. He was polling single digits. Now he surged up to strong double digits out of the blue and that's in the space of three or four weeks. We've got six weeks between now and the British general election, and lots can happen in this kind of volatile environment. So I wouldn't bank on that Theresa May massively increases her majority scenario, although I would bet on it. 

What she wants is she wants flexibility. She wants people to say, trust me, I'm the person who is going to oversee the Brexit thing. But at this precise moment, she wants, like any other candidate, to say as little as possible other than trust me, because if she starts making pledges, saying things like we will have -- Brexit will absolutely guarantee the following things and they don't appear, then she's setting up a massive headache for herself later. She's taken a calculated risk that the opposition is so useless that she can get that mandate through now. But if she gets pushed gradually into revealing more and she's going to have this very hardcore pro-Brexit group within her party saying we mustn't allow X. We shouldn't pay money to the European Union when they go. We shouldn't do these things. That gives her very little wiggle room. Because I think at some point, it's likely she's going to come back from Brussels with what is quite a bad deal for Britain or not, particularly brilliant one. But she'll probably have to say that's the best I can get and that's not going to be an easy sell. 

This is the hard exits. 

Yes. 

That we talked about, versus the soft, more accommodations from the E.U. It's worth mentioning, we are now what? As we stand now two months away or less from the snap election, we're now ten months removed from Brexit? 

Yes. 

The vote? 

And the ramifications are still going on. Only a few -- back in those Halcyon days, it looked like the Tories were looking very secure. Cameron was likely to get a referendum, likely to push forward. British politics has certainly become incredibly volatile. 

One word for it. And as you mention, the polls are volatile as well. I mean, if you're forecasting time-wise here, again, you're now ten months removed, if there is an expectation whether it's going to be hard or a soft exit here, how long is Britain looking at? 

Well, I think it's got to be two years to negotiate the actual divorce agreement. That's an E.U. law. That's the article 50 she triggered in March. But in terms of negotiating a substantial trade deal with Europe that includes all the thorny questions about freedom of movement of peoples, whether the European court of justice has a role. That could take many, many years, beyond even the next election. I mean, it's worth, you know, in terms of John's point that she wants to give away as little as possible in this campaign, she's refusing to debate Jeremy Corbyn. There won't be any TV debates as of now. She might be forced to change that position. But she doesn't want to open her mouth. You know, Corbyn is held in very low regard, she's held in reasonably high regard, best thing to do just avoid him. 

Do you think that can happen? 

Yes. I think she might well get away with the no debates, but imagine she gets dragged into a debate, imagine she only narrowly increases the majority and she has to guarantee things to her back benches about what she wouldn't say. There's a narrative building up in British politics which is particularly among the right-wing press and amongst various members of the conservative party, which says basically no deal on Brexit is better than a bad deal, and that sounds very convincing. But actually when you start picking at that, that means that Britain would immediately have to jump back to operating with world trade organization rules. You look at places, you have the Irish politicians here today, you know, they're making the point. The island of Ireland is divided in two, if we end up with a barrier between one half and the other, which is also the frontier between Britain and the European Union, that is going to be very difficult if there is no kind of free trade deal to cover how people go backwards and forwards across that. There is complication upon complication in this, and she's taking this gamble that she can come back stronger in a better position to be able to do these things. But like everything else it's a risk. 

Ed Luce and John Micklethwait, appreciate both of your time. 

Thank you. 

Pleasure. 

We turn now to a battle being waged in Arkansas over the death penalty. Earlier today, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by the Arkansas attorney general to carry out the first of eight planned executions by the end of the month. The decision comes after a week of last-minute appeals, state and federal debates over lethal injection drugs, and continued questions about the ethics of capital punishment. Hundreds of anti-death penalty advocates converged on Little Rock on Friday, to call on Governor Asa Hutchinson to halt the planned executions. Hutchinson has said that he scheduled the back-to-back executions before the state stock of a lethal injection drug expires. Joining me now to discuss this important issue are Damien Echols, a member of the so-called West Memphis Three. He spent 18 years in prison on death row after being wrongly convicted of murder. He was released in 2011. Lorri Davis, she began a correspondence with Echols while he was in prison and is now an anti-death penalty advocate. And David Boies, he's a founding partner of the law firm Boies, Shiller, and Flexner, and has spent a lot of time on this issue in particular. I'm pleased to welcome all of them to this table. Thank you for being here. Damien, I want to start with you. We mentioned 18 years on death row. You know all of the men currently scheduled for execution right now. 

Yes. 

When this all came up, you went to Little Rock last week. 

I did. 

When this all first cropped back up again, what were your thoughts? 

I was horrified. We got a call from the woman that runs the Arkansas coalition to abolish the death penalty, and she told Lorri that they were having a gathering there to, you know, protesting executions and they asked if I would come there, and my first thought was merely no. You know, it was a nightmare for me. I think it was probably -- I was thinking it would probably be one of, probably the second most traumatic thing to ever happen to me in my life, to have to return back there to where people tried to kill me. You know, second after actually being sent to death row. But the more I thought about it, I couldn't sleep at night because I was thinking I can't just sit here and not raise a hand, not try to do anything while they're killing these guys. But even after I made that decision, I'd go back and forth. You know, I would say, I've got to do this. There's no way -- I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I don't do this. But when I get ready to go to bed that night, I would wake up having panic attacks and feeling like I was having a heart attack and being unable to breathe and I would tell Lorri I can't do it, I can't go. So I would go back and forth all the way up until probably the very last minute, and I just knew this was something I had to do, but it was still trying and horrific. 

Because this was the first real sort of substantial visit back for you where you had to talk to folks and maybe see some of the folks who you hadn't seen in so long. 

Absolutely. And, you know, this was one of those things where the thing that kept going through my mind is these people tried to murder me for something I didn't do. These people knew that I didn't do this. After DNA testing came out in my case, I still sat on death row for two more years while the state tried to figure out how they could still kill me and sweep this under the rug and not have to admit they made a mistake. So all I'm thinking, I'm going back into this place where these people were more than willing to murder me and not lose a night's sleep over it. And I kept thinking over and over, what if they do something else? What if they try to send me back again? So that's what I had to get through. That was what I was wrestling with in an attempt to return to the state. 

I want to talk about more about your back story and what happened to you starting in the early '90s in a moment, but first, I want to talk about what's happening right now and what you were there to talk about on Friday, Don Davis in particular. He's the one scheduled right now, the subject of discussion right now. You knew Don Davis very well. Tell me about him. 

I knew Don for the entire time that I was in prison. He got there before I did, so I knew him for about 18 years. In prison, you don't really develop friendships the way you do in the outside world. The best thing you can hope for is you establish an understanding with someone that, no matter what happens, I'll watch your back and you watch my back. We're going to look out for each other no matter what's taking place. And for me Don Davis was that person. There were times in there that I honestly do not think I would have survived in prison, I would not be sitting here now if not for him looking out for me. So, you know, for other people, for people who are pro-death penalty, these guys are stories they read in the newspaper, things they saw on television. For me, these are flesh and blood people that I lived with for almost 20 years. 

We should mention, Don Davis freely admits his guilt. 

Absolutely. 

Says it was a terrible thing he did. I think he said even if they would have executed him the day after, he would have felt like it was a just execution. He killed a woman in the process of a home invasion. The family of the victim is upset right now. They want this to happen. They're frustrated by further delays. What do you say to them? 

Well, I would say I understand your pain, you know, first and foremost. I don't want to downplay any sort of trauma or anything else that you're going through. I understand it completely. And I understand that desire for vengeance. You know, keep in mind I had people try to murder me. I would like to see the people who did that to me held accountable. I would like to see them be held responsible for what they did to me. But, at the same time, I don't believe that death is ever the answer to anything. And I think you also have to keep in mind that this system is run by human beings. Human beings are fallible. They make mistakes. And when you cast a net this wide and you start executing this many people, starting up what in essence is a conveyor belt of death, you're going to catch innocent people in that net and innocent people are going to die along with the guilty ones, and I don't think that executing the innocent is ever going to ease anyone's pain. 

David, I want to talk about the death penalty. The number of executions has been down. Asa Hutchinson says he has to do this now or wants to do this now because the stock of the drug that they use is going to run out. First of all, why is that running out? Why is the governor doing it at this time? 

I think one of the reasons the drug is running out is that fewer and fewer companies want to be participating in the death process. There are obviously two important problems with the death penalty. One is whether the state, whether the people, whether society ought to be putting anybody to death. The second is that, as this clearly illustrates, the death penalty is applied to a lot of innocent people, and there is nothing that you can think of that society can do that is more troubling than consciously putting to death somebody and then having that person be innocent, and I think that the fallibility of our criminal justice system and the discrimination that poor people, people of color, disadvantaged people face in our criminal justice system is something that ought to give everybody pause about the death penalty. 

Lorri, can I ask you about midazolam a little bit, this is the drug in question that we're talking about that the governor says they're going to run out of. David mentions these drug companies don't want to be in this business... What is it intended for? 

The drug itself isn't an analgesic. It is -- actually the reason it exists is to calm people down so that they are in a relaxed state. So it doesn't prohibit an extremely painful situation when someone has the needle put into their arm and, in many cases, it's caused a great deal of pain on these botched executions when men are lying on the table, gasping for breath. It is said that this death is one of the most painful deaths because they feel as if they're burning up from the inside, literally burning, and this drug doesn't prohibit that pain. And it's a big problem, also, because in Arkansas' case they've cloaked their procedure, so you can't FOI, you know, the general public has no knowledge of how this drug is being administered. It can be just a department of correction employee who's doing it and, in many cases, it's not even a medical doctor because medical doctors, same as the drug companies, aren't interested in killing people. So it's a big problem because people don't know how to administer it. It's not doing what people think it's supposed to do, prohibiting the pain. It's a problem. 

If I could add something. 

Go ahead. 

Keep in mind also, these drugs were never meant to be used to kill people. That's not what they were designed. These were designed by companies to help people, people with ailments, people with sicknesses, people who need surgery, whatever it is. That's what they were designed for. So the state tries to convey this image to the general public that it's sort of like putting an animal to sleep, that the person goes to sleep and they feel no pain and it's over. There are cases where they had to give men they were executing up to 15 doses of this medicine to knock them out and it still took them over two hours to die. They laid on the table gasping, coughing, and twitching for two hours after receiving 15 doses of this medication. 

Lorri, you began correspondence with Damien while he was in prison. 

I did. 

The correspondence picked up, you eventually married. We talked about going back to Arkansas, and I know it was not easy for him, it wasn't easy for you, when all of this happened last week. Why do you think that was so important and what impact do you think it's had? 

I think it was important -- well, speaking for Damien, I think it's important just because he knew all of these men. And like his story about Don Davis, it's hard for him to just turn his back and not do something. I think it was important for everyone to appear at this rally because it's the only thing that the state of Arkansas reacts to, is pressure, being seen. They've been able to do executions. They've been able to convict innocent men for years. It's a very insular place. I lived there for 16 years, I saw the way they conducted their business. The only thing they react to is pressure from the outside, media intervention. So getting the word out to as many people as possible about what they're doing is the only thing that makes a difference. 

And legal intervention. So, David, talk a little bit more about where this case stands and where other germane death penalty cases may stand around the country right now. 

Well, each case is a little bit different. And, indeed, some of the cases in Arkansas right now are different. Some people are claiming innocence. Some people are claiming mental -- a level of mental awareness that makes it inappropriate to put them to death. Some of them are simply opposed to the death penalty under any circumstances. So each case is different. But what you see is a series of legal challenges to the death penalty. Some of them proceed on the argument that any imposition of the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment, violative of the constitution. Some of them proceed on the basis that from a legislative standpoint, legislators should not make the decision to put people to death. On the other hand, there are a number of people who can oppose the death penalty right now who believe that, if you had a perfect system, there are crimes that deserve the death penalty. The problem is that we don't have a perfect system, and what we do is we convict innocent people. We don't have an all-seeing judge that can understand what the truth is. We have imperfect judges and imperfect juries and we have imperfect
