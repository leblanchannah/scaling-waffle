Danny Boyle is here. He's directed such acclaimed films as "28 Days Later," "127 Hours," and "Steve Jobs." He won the Academy Award for best director in 2009 for "Slumdog Millionaire." Boyle first made a name for himself as a filmmaker with his 1996 cult film "Train spotting." The film followed a group of heroin addicts living in squalor in Scotland. Now over 20 years after the original film, Boyle and the original cast have reunited for a highly anticipated sequel. Here's the trailer for "T2, Trainspotting." 

I missed you, man. 

I missed you, too, Spud. Choose your future. Choose wishing you'd done it all differently. Choose life. 

Twenty years just flowing by, yeah? 

We shared our very first hit. Your blood is in my veins, man. 

Do you still take heroin? 

No, not for 20 years. You're an addict. So be addicted. Just be addicted to something else. Take a deep breath and choose life. 

I'm so happy to have Danny Boyle at this table. Welcome. 

Thank, Jeff. 

So a lot of time there's a pressure after such big hits like Trainspotting to do the sequel right away. 

Yeah. 

This didn't happen right away. 

Well I don't have any memory of it. I mean, you would think -- 

Of them wanting you to do it. 

Of anybody expressing an interest in it. You would normally -- commerce would expect to step in at that moment and say that's an unexpected hit. You know, we could do that again, pay the actors a bit more money and everybody would be happy to do it again, yeah? I don't remember any of that pressure at the time. I think there was so much astonishment that it had worked, and not just in Britain, but also globally as well, that it transferred, because it's so specific. I think people were just frozen. Their minds were frozen in astonishment. I thought it's a one-off. It will never happen again. Irving Welsh who wrote the original book, "Trainspotting," he published a sequel, like, seven years later, which was a ten-years-later sequel, that took the characters ten years on, and we tried. We had a go adapting that to try and see if that could be a sequel. 

Tough subject matter. 

Yeah. And it was also -- it wasn't as -- the book's not a great book, the original book, in my mind, and we didn't do a very good job adapting it, and I knew that people would be very disappointed if we put that out. It would have felt like a quite cheap rehash of what we had done originally. And the original is thought of as being very, very original, and so it would be to besmirch it to follow it with something that was highly repetitive, and so we left it. And it was only when the 20 years later, the 20-year anniversary loomed on the horizon that we sat down around a table very like this down in Edinburgh, the two writers, Irving Welsh and John Hodge, the screenwriter, myself, and the two producers, and we talked about it. And something a bit more personal emerged, a bit more painful really, about men aging over time, really, and what men -- because of course they indulge themselves as much as it was ever possible to imagine someone indulging themselves on the edges of society. And then to be caught in what it means to become -- to move from that boyhood to that manhood, to manhood really, and the film really is a study of male -- of masculinity over that time period. 

It's reflective, and it's sad, because what's happened to them over these 20 years is not necessarily wild success. 

No, it isn't. They feel like they've been treading water at best, and Spud, for instance, has remained an addict, on, off in rehab, back on, back addicted, and Sick Boy is in an ever-decreasing circle of scams, really. And Renton has had this crisis where he's fled to with their money. And he's forced back by this crisis, really, medical crisis. 

This is Mark Renton who took off with all the money at the end of the original movie. 

Yeah. 

-- for those who -- and everyone's still upset with him over this. 

Yeah. So he runs away. 

This is Ewan McGregor. 

This is Ewan McGregor. He runs away, and 20 years later he's still running, on a treadmill now, and then there's -- a wall is hit very, very hard, and he's forced to return to where he comes from and to friends who appear to have just been in status until he gets back. And Begbie, the ferocious Begbie, the Robert Carlyle character, has been, understandably, in jail for 20 years. Given his violence, he ends up in jail. But he comes out of jail, of course, and they all eventually meet to relive the past in one sense, or to take revenge on it really, which is Begbie's preoccupation. 

They weren't role models back then for sure. 

No. 

Do you want them to be role models now? 

No. I don't think you can apply that phrase to them. 

In any way? 

No, I don't think so. I think we look to them for kind of an almost an alternative view. And I think that was the success of the first film, is these were voices from the margins that had such a distinctive point of view and such a coruscating sense of humor that they were attractive despite their circumstances, despite some of the things that they were going through, which one of us would wish upon our enemies really. Today, now, they feel they're washed up more, really, because it's no longer -- although they try to, it's no longer possible for them to endlessly try and repeat the glories of the past as they see them. So I don't think you could see them as role models now. But they certainly look like people that we recognize, probably from the more extreme sides of our experience or our friends, but you recognize them as people that you probably have in your own circle of friends, you know. There's the violent one who's always going to be fighting. There's the chaotic one, the clown, Spud. And you kind of see your own -- I'm sure that's one of the reasons it appealed to people so much, you know. And that it was unapologetic as well. It didn't make any apology for what it was doing, for what it was saying, for what it was looking at, and for their behavior. It didn't condone it, nor did it apologize for it. 

Yeah. More things change the more they stay the same with these guys. 

Indeed, which those sound like old cliches. You realize a cliche is a cliche because they're often -- 

They're often true. 

They're often true. 

The name "T2," so this has gotten a lot of attention; right? I mean, I'm just curious about the genesis of this, because when people think T2, they think "Terminator 2;" right? 

Yeah. 

James Cameron and all that stuff. You didn't want to call it just "Trainspotting. This went through all number of developments in terms of a title. 

Yes, it did actually. We original -- we wouldn't call it "Trainspotting at all originally, and that seems perverse, but it was very important to nourishing the film on its own, so it didn't feel like it was going to be a sequel. Of course it is a sequel. You're bringing back four actors to play the same four characters. It's necessarily so. But you wanted it to develop its own identity and to cherish and nourish that a little before getting into the inevitable. So when we do that, it got on its own feet and we worked out its relationship with the original film in more detail, we admitted to the studio, okay, we will call it -- but we want to call it not quite Trainspotting, we want to call it "T2," and they said, "Why?" They said, "Everybody who goes online is going to go to the James Cameron film. They're going to book for a James Cameron book or DVD." And we said, "No, it's because if they were -- the characters, if we ask the characters themselves, 'What would you call the sequel if you were going to be in it,' they would say, 'well you should name it after that really great sequel, Terminator 2'." So we called it "T2" Terminator -- oh, "T2 Trainspotting" rather. And it is a tribute to James Cameron. That is one to have greatest sequels of all time. And there's never been -- we've never bettered the liquid robots. No one has. And so it's hats off to James Cameron. But it was also to slightly annoy him as well, because that's what these characters' nature, they're perverse and contrary like that. 

You're trolling him a little bit. 

You know, in the nicest possible way. 

So did you talk to James Cameron about the title? 

No, we didn't have to because apparently it's a nickname. It's not a legally declared name for a film. Everybody lazily says "T2" for it. So we thought we'd have a joke. The film is full of that kind of -- both films are full of that kind of irreverence, really. It's a kind of inbuilt part of their -- it's part of their DNA to behave in a disrespectful way to those who have gone before them, really. 

So all the guys had come, or some had never left, but they all come back to Edinburgh, and are sort of trying to figure out the next way to make money. 

Yeah. 

To make a living. To do it in whatever way they can, and they just, in various ways, haven't been successful for two decades. 

Yeah. They scam. They scam. Their nature is to scam, if they can, which is to kind of con people out of money or to steal money, either from individual's wallets, and you see them stealing credit cards from people and PIN numbers from people, or from the European Union actually. They applied for funding for one of their projects to the European Union. And they get it. 

They get it. 

Astonishingly. It can't be that easy, surely. But in this circumstance -- it's a movie -- they do get some funding from them. 

You mentioned the European Union, and this movie, the film was being shot as Brexit was playing out, and now there's talk of another Scottish referendum. This takes place in Scotland. And there are some themes of nationalism here. I'm just wondering how topical you wanted to try to be and how much you were thinking about that as you were making it. 

I mean, obviously some people do choose to make films that they wish to be topical. I find that very difficult because they take so long to make movies that if you want to be -- it's a serious risk if you want to be topical, if that's the reason for your film. I mean, people do read things into them. I was just based more on how the characters behave rather than a kind of world view we might have about politics particularly. It would be impossible. We shot while the BREXIT vote was happening. It literally was. We all voted on the day that we filmed, one of the days we filmed. And even more complicatedly, Scotland -- unlike the United Kingdom voted to leave Europe, Scotland contrarily voted substantially to stay in Europe, 62 percent, and I think it's led to her, just yesterday actually, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, she triggered the next referendum, the process, the legal process by which there will be a second referendum about whether Scotland remains in the United Kingdom, which it was asked previously a couple years ago, and it just decided to stay in the United Kingdom. Now the question will be whether it's on the ballot paper or not -- on the referendum paper or not, is do you wish to be part of Europe still, because the rest of the United Kingdom is withdrawing from it. And I think Scotland will choose to stay in Europe rather than to stay in the UK. I don't think that the Scottish -- I mean I'm English, and I know the Scottish have never had any really great fondness for the English anyway. We've always been at wars with them. We've seen many times. And, actually, if anything, they have an affinity with the French rather than the English. And Mary Queen of Scots used to keep her armies in Scotland ready to attack England, so there's a history there, you know. 

You were dealing with guys 20, 21, 22 years ago who were young, up and coming actors. A number of them have become directors themselves. 

Yeah. 

So they're wiser about the game. 

Yeah, that's true. 

They sort of -- they might have their own opinions on ways things should be. 

Yeah. 

Does that make things easier or more complicated for you? 

Weirdly, I mean, it made it a lot easier. It's not so much directing experience, because I think that Ewan McGregor and Bobby Carlyle have both made movies, feature film movies. I think they were delighted not to have the responsibility of the directing, and they could just think about their character. Where you benefit from is their experience as storytellers, the four of them. They've done so many -- you know a director does maybe one film every two years. Actors can maybe tell four or five different stories in a calendar year, and you realize that they know shortcuts and they know how to help you in a way -- it's almost unspoken. It's almost automatic sometimes. And I did notice it particularly in comparison to when we made the first one, when we were all pretty much stumbling around not really knowing what we were doing, and we kind of got away with it. If you're lucky, you get away with it early days. We all know that experience of seat of our pants, you know, and all that kind of stuff. But now they're much more skilled, but they're impatient because they have the performance ready and they want to give it. And they don't want to be delayed by crews and by delays with lighting and things like that. So it was interesting, me and the crew, we had to really be on top marks, really, in order to capture the performances from them, because they're itching to give them, you know. 

I'm curious about how you pushed these guys now, because since they are comfortable in these roles. Are you still trying to put them in places where they're not comfortable? 

Yeah, a little bit sometimes. You do, after -- they're very brave actors, and certainly the first film, and this film, they're not like mumble core social realist performances. They're quite big and they're quite declared performances. So they're always happy to have a look at the extremes of the way to perform the character. So you can make suggestions like that. They have an automatic -- all actors have an automatic safety where if they sense they're overdoing it, they'll pull back anyway, a good actor anyway. 

But they have -- but it would become too easy for them, these roles; right, because these characters have just existed now for 20 years; right? 

Yeah. Although they were nervous, I think, about going back to them. 

Oh, they were? 

Yeah, initially would they be able to be Renton again or be Begbie again? And until you start doing it you don't know, of course. But the script was an excellent script and that filled them with a lot of confidence, really, I think. You feel an obligation obviously that you are not going to dishonor the past, both in terms of the original film, but also in terms of the tone, Edinburgh, and which was -- it played such a huge part in all our careers. And so the obligation you feel is not so much an ongoing nervousness about can I do it, it's will I do it well enough to make sure -- will we all do it well enough to make sure that we make something that's worthy to stand beside the original, you know. 

Welsh, you mentioned he wrote the sequel that came out a little less than ten years after his original book. He also wrote a prequel -- 

Yes. 

-- to Trainspotting. Has there been any talk of doing that in any way? 

He's very interesting. He visits these characters, and other characters associated with them multiple times in multiple books. And he's done a book "Skagboys," which is about their lives, their younger lives. And there's been talk about the television series in the new television world, you know, extended storytelling over ten hours and maybe multiple series. So there's been talk about that. He's also written an extraordinary book about just Begbie called the "Blade Artist," which is the most recent work he's published, and that is a wonderful book, very interesting. Not written like his other work. Very compact and thriller like. And I know Bobby Carlyle would love to do that. But that may emerge out of this kind of -- it's not really a character spin off like in the Marvel universe, but it's sort of the Trainspotting version of that, yeah. 

Begbie is still the toughest one to watch. 

Yeah. But don't people like him as well, in a way that you wouldn't think. 

You think? 

I mean not like him, like him, but, actually, he's funny. You laugh. You have a good laugh, and -- 

He's funny but -- 

You never want to be caught alone with him in a bar. 

Yeah. 

But he's very tender at the end. Didn't you find that? 

He was, yes. After being untender for -- 

For a long time. 

For a long time. I think it can be very difficult to watch him, because I just think he's -- because, I mean, they're all self-destructive in a way. 

Yes. 

But he can be self-destructive and violent. 

He's actually the most destructive of all of them, yes. 

Yeah. 

He's a very interesting actor, Bobby. He can access that in a terrifying way, and yet he's a sweetheart. But interestingly, he doesn't -- he doesn't go home to his family when he's performing Begbie because he thinks, in some way, that it's sort of -- he doesn't want it -- he thinks it's still in his clothes. This is how he expresses it; that there might be elements still around him that he can't -- that he's not aware of, and that he'll brush against his children in some way. So he always stays in a hotel when he's doing Begbie, which is not so good if you're staying in a hotel with him perhaps. 

I don't blame him. I think we have -- for the sake of his family, I think we have a Begbie clip. Relax, don't do it when you want to go to it. Relax, don't do it when you want to come. Relax, don't do it when you want to come. Relax, don't do it. Relax, don't do it when you want to come. 

Don't stop. 

Another example of Begbie willing to put himself in danger to hurt -- 

To hurt others. Particularly to hurt Renton, if he can. 

Yeah, to hurt someone else. It did surprise me that you did this, a little bit. 

It did, yeah? 

Well, only because you jumped around so successfully into different genres and never sort of have really been pegged into one movie or one film; right? And so that you would return to the same characters -- I don't know, it seems like you would almost -- like your wanderlust would just want to carry you somewhere else and you wouldn't want to go back necessarily. 

Except weirdly, of course, it became the biggest challenge of all, is once you broach the ideas is could you return to it and make something decent that would stand beside it? So it wasn't that you were going to repeat something that you knew you could do or that you were familiar with. And studios often want to hire you because they think you can do a certain genre. They think, oh, he's good at that, let's get him to do that. So it wasn't really that fitting. It was can we move it on. And 20 years is such an extraordinary timespan, because it's the perfect timespan for that telescope of time, where, depending on which way you looked in the telescope, it's either almost out of reach or it's on top of you still. And movies, this is one of the things I learned doing it, and it was so wonderful to do it, was movies are about time. I've never -- when we got in the editing, you realize what movies are, and it's the ultimate art form, is for the study of time, because all you do in the editing, and you know this in editing, you compress time or you extend it, or you make it vanish or you stop it or you start it again. And it's this control of time all the time over the audience's two hours of time that they give you that it's the perfect art form for. And you can literally -- and audiences, if they have a favorite film, and for some people Trainspotting is a very affectionate feeling, an image that they have of it. They have locked to actors in time, and I know that. I've done this with films where -- and know the actors make other films and they're aging over here, but I have that image of them there, and then you can go back to that image and just say, no, they're not mythologized. They're us. They're just like us. They answer time like we all do. You know, it's in the post for all of us. And men especially deny it for so long and so often and so vigorously, we try to kind of keep our backs turned to it. But you realize, ultimately, time doesn't care about you, and you have to make your peace with it somehow. So it was -- I couldn't think of -- there was nothing that I wanted to do more than it once we began working on it in that way, yeah. 

You mentioned the studios and how they want to push you a certain way, and, I mean, you've always resisted that, because you don't -- I think you don't want the stories to go a certain way, or you want them to go the way you think you can tell that story the best way. You're a Hollywood guy. You made a couple Hollywood movies, a couple of American films. 

Yeah. 

But it's mostly -- you'd rather keep the budget a little lower and keep the independence than take the bigger money and get told what to do. 

Yeah. I mean we make the films for a limited budget. It's still a lot of money, because it's usually somewhere south of $20 million, which is a huge amount of money in anybody's life. 

But compared to T2, you know, the other T2, you know, I mean -- 

Yeah. But he's a genius at handling bigger budgets as well. But I don't -- this is just a personal preference. And I love watching the bigger budget movies, especially James Cameron ones. But it's obvious, if a studio gives you $15 million they're going to be worried, but not as worried as the guy they're giving $200 million to. So inevitably you think, well, there's a big of cunning there, we'll keep them off of back as much as possible. And it's not a question of they're not the great evil ones. You want to work with them, and you work with some really good people in the studios as well. But obviously the financial concerns, if you ease them for as long as possible, it gives you freedom to express yourself in the way you want to do. And also, it's provocations like the first Trainspotting film, and there's elements within this, which are really tough choices that you make, which, in a mainstream film that costs a hundred million dollars, you probably wouldn't be wise to include, you know. 

No, probably not, once you see T2. The music, as was the case in the first one, is thundering and prominent, and this isn't just a movie, it's a soundtrack. 

Yeah. 

And so what kind of care in the selection goes into figuring out what makes it in? 

Oh, everything. I mean it's -- I'm a product of music, like so many of us are, the pulse war, really music, and by that, I mean pop music really, is a kind of liquid architecture that runs through our lives backward and forward, and it's defined us and it's sneered often by high culture as low culture. But, actually, for me, it's all culture. And, actually, these characters in the first movie, and in this movie, the music is as important to them and as their dialogue, as the scenarios in the scenes. It stands beside them as an equal character in the film really. And it sets off different emotions in people, which is one of the most extraordinary things about it, especially with this, because we try to trigger that a number of types that muscle memory you have of the first movie, yet you hear cords that you recognize from that first movie, and they're reemerging. We didn't just want to copy, you know, repeat the music from the first film. So it's been reimagined or remixed. But they do trigger emotions in you, which are, in movie terms, it's wonderful to do that, because it's not a conscious thing you're in control of with music. It affects you in different ways and to do with your own memories, often to do with those tracks, or you complement a scene or contradict a scene that you're watching, you know. So that one, you had "Frankie Goes to Hollywood," which is a great gay anthem, really, and it's a character in it, Begbie, who is taking a considerable amount of Viagra before that scene happens. But in the scene we're not allowed to show it on television, you'll have to go to the cinema to see it. You clearly see that his blood lust is excited by the fighting with Renton rather than the way he would conventional challenge it as you think. So you can have tremendous fun with the choice of music as well and trigger lovely connections with people, for whom pop culture is our culture, you know. For us all, we live through music, you know. In the younger generation you look for -- I mean we don't use Rhianna, but you look for a Beyonce, but you look how important it is in their lives. I look at my girls, and the importance of that music in their lives, it's huge, really, and deserves to be cherished as true culture, even if it's only three minutes long. 

A pleasure to see on screen, a pleasure to have you here, Danny Boyle. Thanks so much. 

Lovely. Thanks, Jeff. Cheers, man.
