We begin this evening with the attacks outside London's parliament today, the driver of a large vehicle ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring others before crashing into a railing, at least one man then exited the vehicle and approached parliament, where he stabbed an armed police officer to death. He was then later fatally shot by police. Hundreds of people, including Prime Minister Theresa May were inside parliament and were forced into lockdown. The attacks falls on the anniversary of the suicide bombings in Brussels that claimed more than 30 lives last year. London police commander BJ Harrington said: a full counterterrorism investigation is underway. 

The senior national coordinator had declared this a terrorist incident. And although we remain open-minded to the motive, a full counterterrorism investigation is already underway. 

And here is the latest on the attacks from the CBS evening news. 

There's breaking news in the terror attack in London, we have just received word that a fourth innocent person was killed in that attack today. Just as the British were on guard for a possible attack in the sky, they were struck on the ground, in the heart of London. A driver plowed a car into a group of pedestrians, then stabbed a police officer, at least four people including the officer were killed, 20 others were wounded. The attacker was shot to death by the police. Elizabeth Palmer is in London. 

There has been a terror attack. 

In only seconds, a car speeding along the sidewalk left a trail of broken and bleeding bodies strewn across one of London's busiest bridges. Seconds later, the car had crashed into the railings around parliament, setting off a panicked rush. In the chaos, shots rang out. (GUNSHOTS) It turned out the driver had shoved past security into parliament's grounds and started to stab a policeman until he was fatally shot by another officer. The attack began in early afternoon, when parliament was in session, but astonished politicians were suddenly told it was in lockdown. 

I'm now going to suspend the sitting of the House. This House is now suspended, but please wait here. (SIRENS) 

British Prime Minister Theresa May was whisked to safety, while on the nearby bridge paramedics helped the injured and fought to save the dying. Sunnita and Bobby Nagi, tourists from India, saw the whole attack unfold. 

He was speeding on the pavement and he was knocking off people walking by. So there was a big sound, one after the other. 

Yes. 

Sunnita ran. Bobby started filming. One victim flung under a bus... Another lying still in the middle of the road surrounded by shocked bystanders. 

I immediately told my wife that this is an attack, it's a terrorist attack. 

There was no question in your mind that he was going for as many people as he could get? 

Yes, he was. He was just going on and on, he didn't stop. 

One British member of parliament on his way to work did his best to save the staff policeman, but a short time later, he died. Police say a full terrorist investigation is underway into the most serious attack in London since the deadly subway bombings of 2005. 

Francine Lacqua of Bloomberg London joins me now from the scene. And also here, Katty Kay of the BBC is with me at the table. Francine, what do we know now? 

Well, Charlie, we've been briefed by police all evening, the attacks started about 2:20 PM local time. Now where I'm standing right now is on the south side of Westminster Bridge. We understand that a car, a vehicle went through the bridge trying to mow down pedestrians. We know 20 people are critically injured. We know three people died, and one extra person that was killed was the assailant. We understand so far that there was only one attacker. The car then continued to drive, took a left on to the House of Parliaments, that's when he got out of the car, took a knife out and stabbed a police officer. He was then apprehended by another police officer in civilian clothing who shot him. 

I've said London police commander BJ Harrington said a full counterterrorism investigation is underway. As far as you know, do the police, at this point, consider it likely to be a terrorist attack? 

Yes, Charlie. And this was actually clear right from the start, about 15 minutes after this was underway, we understand or we understood from both Scotland Yard but also senior officials in government that this was treated as a full-on terrorist attack. This is the most serious terrorist attack in over ten years. Again, there is an investigation underway, Charlie. So one of the things that they told reporters, and they briefed us numerous times, is not to speculate too much on who the attacker could be. We've heard from the prime minister, Teresa May, giving full statement outside Downing Street a couple of minutes ago. And what she was very clear on was that this was an attack and what she said was this was not only an attack, but it was an attack at the heart of our capital city. She is taking, of course, this very seriously, but we don't know much more beyond that. She was in a cobra meeting with civil servants and also senior police officers to try to figure out more on who exactly was behind the attack. 

Katty Kay, what can you add to this? 

Look, what we do know is that it seems like one assailant, armed only with a knife, Charlie, and a car managed to shut down one of the biggest cities in the world for the cost of -- 

And locked down parliament. 

Locked down parliament. To keep members of parliament, hundreds of members of parliament on lockdown inside the Houses of Parliament and terrorize one of the great cities in Europe, and one of the great cities in the world, and that's what terrorism does, right? That's why it is so effective. But it doesn't take very much for somebody -- we don't know who it is. We don't know who the assailant was. And we'll get that information as this investigation unfolds. But it is a remarkably brutal and successful form of terror in the western world that somebody is managing to perpetrate. 

For both of you, it also adds to this idea that as there is some success in Mosul, and maybe in Raqqa later, with respect to ISIS, even at its headquarters, there are other means to carry on that does not involve territory. 

Well, this is what the so-called Islamic state group has been wanting to do, to have freelance operations around the West as it gets squeezed in its caliphate in Syria and Iraq, it's feeling under pressure and it wants to show that it still has -- 

Alive and well. 

-- power, and it's still alive and well. And this is the way that it can do it. And the truth is we will never be able to stop this, right? We're never going to be able to totally eradicate people who are determined, if this is what it turns out to be, to take other people's lives and are prepared to sacrifice their own lives in the process. This is easy and it's cheap to do. 

Francine, does the London government -- British government view terrorism different in how they define it, how they act against it? 

Well, the U.K. government has, this evening, said that we stay at the same terror level alert. This was at high to severe about two years ago, meaning that a terror attack is likely. So we are not at the highest level, of course, we have police, we understand that for the next couple of days, there will be more police deployed. One of the ministers also said that they may call on the military if they find it necessary. But, Charlie, the big difference I see and I've covered a lot of terrorist attacks throughout Europe, I am thinking of Brussels, again you were saying, it was only a year ago to the day, that we saw that horrific airport attack in Brussels, is that we have a lot of CCTV cameras here. So in the past, when we've had attacks, or things that were heightened tensions for the public, it was fairly quick for the government and the police forces to find out who the perpetrators are, because we have so many CCTV cameras. I think we counted. It was about one camera for every 14 Londoners. 

The argument has sometimes been made that the British view it as a police matter. And that, therefore, the investigative powers of the local police, you know, is immediately employed. 

Well, certainly in this case. We're talking about the House of Westminster right? Right in the middle of London. There were a lot of tourists, there were a lot of politicians, there were a lot of school children, and indeed, there were French school children who were injured in the course of this attack. So immediately as this unfolded, you had the area swamped with police, some of them were armed police, which is unusual in the U.K., in and of itself. And the mayor of London, tonight, Sadiq Khan, has also said Londoners must be aware that there will be extra police and extra security on the streets over the next few days. Francine is right, there's not only CCTV footage, the other remarkable thing about this attack is that it was filmed by passers-by. We have the former minister of Poland who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment who produced video of the attack as it unfolded. 

So where are we now, Francine? What is the next thing to happen? 

Well, we are expecting and hoping to be briefed a little bit later on by metropolitan police, Scotland Yard, they've been keeping reporters up to date. But I do have to say, Charlie, that it took a little bit longer than expected or than usual for the prime minister to come out again. We do think that she was briefed quite extensively. She knows of these matters. She's handled them in the past. She was Home Secretary for over six years. So we're hoping to be briefed as much as we can, and then of course find out a little bit more about the injured. 

Thank you so much, Francine, as late as it is in London. 

Thank you. 

Thank you, my dear. Good to have you here. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Katty Kay of the BBC. We'll be right back, stay with us. Steve Coll is here. He is the dean of Columbia Journalism School. He's also a staff writer for "The New Yorker Magazine." His latest piece in this week's issue is called Rex Tillerson Is Still Acting Like a CEO. It takes a look at Tillerson's relationship with the press. The secretary's trip to Asia last week became the subject of controversy when Tillerson announced that he would not be traveling with the diplomatic press corps. Tillerson has come under fire for his media silence since taking office, neglecting what many view as an integral part of the role as secretary of state. Coll's 2012 book, "Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power" is a study of the oil giant and its role in world affairs. I am pleased to have Steve Coll back at this table, welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

I can imagine now, I've said this before, it is an exciting time and I can't remember more exciting time to be a reporter, to be a journalist, to be looking at what's happening in the world. 

Yes. It is an exciting time to be at a journalism school as well, all these young reporters going out into this environment, trying to figure out how to do their job professionally. It's a time I think when the attacks on the press have actually strengthened the press, made clearer what our role is under our constitutional system, and also raise the bar on our performance. We've got to be good now, we're going to have to earn it in this environment of kind of trying to de-legitimatize the press or divide the press, so, yes, an exciting time to be in this profession. 

Did we as journalists, or should we as journalists, have learned something from the campaign? 

Absolutely. Yes, I think there were lots of misses in the run-up to the election by journalism writ large. Of course we have lots of journalism in this country now. It's part of the story, our media is fragmented. But there was an over reliance on prediction, an over reliance on data science, and we've lost a lot of professional reporting in the heartland of the country where the election was decided. It used to be, 20 years ago, that there were very healthy newspaper newsrooms in all of these cities and even midtowns, and they were feeding through wire services and syndication services into the networks, into the two coasts, and I don't think we would have been quite so surprised in New York and California on the whole -- 

If we had access to what they were saying? 

Yes. A lot of reporting in Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin that was done by major news organizations was parachute reporting, it wasn't coming out of those states, those newsrooms with the same kind of pulsing power that it used to have. And I also think, certainly, at journalism school, we wrestle with the role of big data in this world, and the way journalism now requires computational skills and data science skills, that's all true. But there was a little bit of an over reliance on data science prediction in this election, and an under-reliance of knocking on doors and going into key districts. 

What we used to call the shoe leather stuff. 

Yes, I remember at "The Washington Post" 15, 20 years ago, there was a ritual in the general election, guys like Dan Balz and David Broder would choose like 12 swing districts, and they would go out and they would stand in front lawns and knock on people's door and say, what's on your mind, what issues are driving you, what are you thinking? And it wasn't to predict the result, but when you read their 3,000 word omnibus report of all of these voices, and they would take advantage of their experience, going back to these places and you had a sense of where it was going. At least it was an authentic role of journalism. It wasn't trying to give you a mathematical number of the likelihood of an outcome. It was going out into these communities and letting voters be heard on the eve of the election. So I think we missed doing some of that this time around. 

There's also this. It is the first time that I can remember, even though they may have felt it, candidates said that the press was the enemy. 

Well, one candidate who is now the president of the United States said that. 

I know that, but that's my point. 

Yes. That's a real -- 

I mean, others, I mean, you always had, among politicians, the feeling that they didn't get a fair shake. 

Yes. 

But here you had somebody really took on the press in the campaign as the enemy. 

Yes. And that was part of a strategy of populism and the de-legitimization of critics that has extended to the judiciary, to the federal bureaucracy. When you have the president of the United States on his first day in office apparently telephoning someone at the National Park Service to complain about their posting a photograph that he didn't like of his inauguration crowds, you know you're in a new world of presidential conduct. 

Or you have a new kind of president. 

Yes, a new kind of -- yes. And so, I think overall, my sense is that the press is used to being attacked. I mean, if you're a reporter and you haven't been yelled at by your subjects a few times, you're not doing your job. 

Right. 

And so, I don't think the press has been shaken by those kinds of assaults. I worry about the de-legitimization of our constitutional design by all of this incendiary speech that seeks to personalize or de-legitimatize the functions of judges and professional reporters. And people at the National Park Service who are serving their -- the taxpayers. So I worry about a strategy of trying to just kind of change the contours of how our system is supposed to work, but as to the press being called out, come on, we're used to that, we should shoulder it, and just get on with our jobs. 

That's exactly what I say when people ask me that, I say we should just do our job. 

Yes. 

You know, and not worry about anything else, do our job. But when you look now at the idea of fake news and not an acceptance of what facts are, that seems to portend something different. 

Well unfortunately, this term, "fake news," has now been highjacked for it to mean news I don't like. It started out to describe something more specific and more worrisome, which was the manufacturing of deliberately false information, sometimes for commercial purposes. 

Right. 

In sort of offshore little businesses, and then distributing that across social media platforms and making money off of the advertising that was available because it clicked. Some of this manufactured news, which wasn't done for ideological reasons in some cases, as I say, it was done to make money, did focus on Trump because people clicked on those stories. Then you have another category of news which is maybe disinformation or heavily ideological news, very difficult to determine, it's an eye-of-the-beholder question as to when something is so distorted, so deliberately constructed to mislead that it crosses from just being a hard opinion into being an active disinformation campaign, but there is also quite a lot of flow across social media of essentially partially invented stories that mislead, for ideological or political purposes. And, look, the social media platforms are the story here, I think, not because they're solely responsible for this problem, but they represent a profound change in the way news is distributed in our democracy. So newspapers used to control their distribution system right down to the driveway where the paperboy toss the paper, the networks had a clear pathway from their newsrooms to their audiences sitting at appointment television. Now essentially the people who create news have lost control of its distribution because the most important way that it's distributed is through Facebook and other social media platforms. And those companies see themselves as neutral, they don't see themselves as editors or gatekeepers, their idea is that whoever -- 

They're just the distribution path. 

Yes, a kind of platform for exchange, free exchange, and it's difficult for them to accept responsibility for policing a public square of sorts that they've created, which is quite profitable for them. And so, I don't think we've gotten very far in resolving the challenge that this election has presented to us, and I feel pretty sure that it's going to get worse next time around. 

In the next election? 

Yes, because people have learned how to do this, and they -- the power of social media platforms as a distribution arm for news is not going to go away between now and 2020. And I think the companies, Facebook is, you know, trying to figure out what it can do, what it should do, it is at least stepping forward to engage around these questions, but I'm not sure that they're going to be in a position to prevent this kind of campaigning in the future, or that it is in their business interest to do so. So I think this is not just something in the rearview mirror. This is something that is going to shape our democracy. 

And how can you define what the use of Twitter by this president has done? 

Well, it's interesting. You know, the media, of course, and the role of media in politics has changed as the technology has changed. So remember when President Reagan came to town, and he was a master of television, and he and Mike Deaver modeled this presidency of going over the heads of the working press by stage managing the president's speech and appearances and his power and so forth, and everyone remarked on how successfully he had done an end-run around the press using television. Well, President Trump has done the same thing using Twitter, which is, he has managed to break out of the constraints that presidents either choose to impose on their communication because they want a more elegant and more constrained -- 

Yes, but he's done it to his own detriment. Many would argue, even, including people I think within his own close advisors, who, because it takes him off message and creates a whole distraction. 

Yes. 

That does not allow what may have been, after that speech, a positive message. 

Yes, I mean, I think every political consultant in the country would agree with that. There's no question about it. I'm struck. I'm sure -- it's a little bit disconcerting, but the power of that platform, the way he uses it to reach right into your pocket. You know, you wake up in the morning, you flip your phone on and there's the president of the United States, saying something, look what he has done again. And it's that populist strategy of being able to speak directly to the people in the name of the people without gatekeepers, without advisors, without consultants. That's been his conceit throughout. And he is a professional entertainer, right? He knows how to control a stage and a live set. He knows how to use confrontation to create drama, that may be no way to run a country, but it is his instinct about how to communicate. And I'm not sure that he's going to be able to relinquish it, judging by the pattern so far, which is, there seems to be certain hours of the day where he just -- he must, he must react. 

Are there discussions among deans of journalism schools and editors of papers about, so where are we and what do we do other than the very basic thing, we do our job? 

We had a convening at the school a few weeks ago with editors from mainstream press. We had an editor from Breitbart there about covering the Trump presidency. 

Right. 

I think in the end, everyone circles around to what you said, which is that we don't need to lose confidence in our role under the first amendment. We know through experience and our professional lives what to do, and we know what the questions are. This is a remarkable constitutional scenario. Just on the admissions that were made in the Congress yesterday, where the FBI director says that members of the president's campaign team are under active investigation because of concerns about their contacts with Russia. We know -- 

The word collusion was used. 

Collusion. And we know that from, at least according to 17 or 18 intelligence agencies, that the Russian intelligence services carried out a d
