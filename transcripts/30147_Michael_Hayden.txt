Good evening, I'm Dan Senor filling in for Charlie Rose. On Saturday, President Trump took to Twitter to accuse former president Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election. FBI director James Comey reportedly asked the Justice Department to reject the president's unsubstantiated claims, arguing that the allegations are false. A spokesman for the White House said Monday morning that President Trump does not accept Comey's denial of the charge. Joining me now is General Michael Hayden. He has served as both director of the CIA and the National Security Agency. His book, "Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror," is now out in paperback. And I am pleased to have him at this table. 

Hi. 

Thank you. This is a fantastic book. 

Thank you. 

I read it when it was in hard cover. 

Great. 

I will revisit it now that it's in soft cover. But before we get to the book, let's talk about news that is happening today and this weekend. First, let's talk about the allegations of wiretapping, allegations that President Obama engaged in wiretapping. You were in the business -- 

Yes. 

-- of wiretapping, loosely defined at the NSA and at the CIA. Can you explain to our viewers the process by which an administration can initiate the wiretapping process? 

Yes. And I guess the first thing I'd say, Dan, is probably the word administration is the wrong word. 

OK, all right. 

In the 1970's, Church Pike, reformer of the American intelligence community, we took the authority to do that out of the hands of the executive and put it into Article 3 courts. So the only way you can target, and that's the technical word we use here -- the only way you can target a U.S. person, an American citizen anywhere or anyone inside the United States, the only way you can target that person is through an Article 3 FISA warrant, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court warrant, and you have to prove to the judge that the target of this surveillance is either, A, the agent of a foreign power; or B, involved in some sort of criminal activity to a standard of probable cause. And so, when President Trump tweets out Barack Obama bugged my home or Trump Tower, and so on, my first reaction is, that's just not so. Because even if Barack Obama was pulling a lever in the Oval Office to make that happen, there is nothing on the other end of that lever, right? He can't make it happen. It has to happen via an Article 3 court. So number one, the president can't order it. So put that claim aside. 

OK. 

Now number two, did it happen at all? All right. So, broadly speaking, there are two purposes for a FISA warrant. One is a foreign intelligence purpose. The other is counterintelligence or a law enforcement purpose. Now you have already quoted Director Comey. Now that's indirect. I would really like to see the director speak publicly. But according to reporting, Director Comey has said he didn't do it. 

Right. 

So it didn't happen in the counterintelligence or law enforcement lane. And yesterday on Meet the Press, Jim Clapper, former director of National Intelligence was on. And Jake Todd said, well, I'm sure you can't confirm or deny. And Jim said, oh yes, I can. I deny it, it didn't happen. And so what you've got -- 

He said it didn't happen, not that he wasn't involved. He said it didn't happen. 

It didn't happen while he was -- he and I, of course, when this was happening. And so you've got the two universes that FISA's come out of, one led by Jim Comey and the other led by Jim Clapper. And both men are saying it didn't happen. Now, could it have technically happened? Sure, all right. But in order for it to have happened, someone had to go to a court and prove to the judge that the target, which I'm assuming is somebody in the Trump campaign or Trump organization, the target was the agent of a foreign power involved in criminal activity to a level of probable cause. That can't be good news for the administration either. 

Right. So I want to come back to the Russia piece of this because of public policy matter. But one other issue, today the administration, Secretary Kelly, who you know, announced a new order relating to the travel ban. Now I am somewhat sympathetic and we can debate the rollout of the initial travel ban. But the argument that the administration made initially that in those countries where individuals, you know, could be traveling from, you have basically failed states, not in all cases but in most, you have failed states, collapsed vetting processes. You know, shouldn't there be a case for, they would argue, shouldn't there be a case for at least tightening up the process by which we make decisions about who comes in and out of the country. 

I understand. And they took the not so failed state, Iraq, out of the list. 

Right. 

Because there is a working government there. So I mean, I would say that we have got a far better implementation plan. But I probably would disagree with your premise for what I think is a flawed policy. It's not because these aren't bad places. They are, right? But I do think the campaign rhetoric has gotten way ahead of our skis here, in how much a threat this really represents. Second thing, is the campaign continually said, and we have no idea who these people are. That's simply not true. We do have vetting. In fact, let me go out on a limb here. We've got extreme vetting already. 

That's U.S. government driven on this side. 

The U.S. government vetting these people. Can we make it better? Sure. Should we try to make it better? Absolutely. But what you've got here is this almost apocalyptic threat with this totally dysfunctional vetting system, therefore we've got to stop people coming in and we've got to do a do-over. I just think that's flawed. Now in one way that's just unfortunate, and we're leaning on the world's unfortunate people to put up with this. But in other way, Dan, it is not just that. It's bad, all right, because particularly the way the first order was rolled out. But I think at the core even of the very improved order, is a premise that feeds the jihadist narrative that there is undying enmity between Islam and the west, Islam and modernity, Islam and the United States. There is a civil war going on within Islam. And there a fraction of Islam, not a trivial fraction, that believes that narrative. When we do these kinds of things, we seem to be living the role they say we have. We hate them, we don't want them here. And so I fear, and the damage may already have been done. I fear we have kind of reinforced their story. But this is a clash between civilizations rather than what I really think it is, Dan, the center of gravity is that this is a fight within a civilization, within Islam. And by doing what we just did, to my mind, without real purpose, has actually somewhat hurt us within that civil war. 

So staying in that region, let's spend a moment on another issue that's top of the perplexing problem list, a lot to choose from. Iran. 

Yes. 

So during the campaign, then candidate Trump talked about the U.S. extricating itself from the multilateral deal that the Obama administration struck with Iran. What do you think -- do you think that is viable? Do you think that should be a priority? 

So here's the way I look at the Iranian deal. Think of it as three packages, OK. One is what we call the deal. 

Right. 

And that's what is going to happen to the Iranian program in the next ten years, all right. I got gas with that, we can fill the rest of this space with my complaining about it. But frankly, of the three baskets I'm going to give you, it's the best. They are further away from a weapon than they would otherwise be. Then you've got the problem of what happens after ten years when the limits age off. And then finally, you've got all the things that Iran is doing in the region now. I think their correct approach, and I think the Trump administration is going there, is leave the current deal as deal alone. We don't have international consensus to rip it up anywhere. Start turning the heat up, though, amp up the pressure a bit on our friends about what happens in ten years when these things begin to age off. And then, and here is something the Obama administration refused to do, and then you got to start punching the Iranians in the nose for all the other things they're doing in the region. 

Proxy wars? 

Proxy wars. What they're doing in Iraq, certainly what they're doing in Syria, certainly what they're doing in Yemen. All the chest thumping in the straits of Hormuz and so on. These can't be cost free. And I fear, Dan, in fact, I'm pretty confident that this is what happened, that we held our policy towards all those transgressions hostage to the nuclear deal on the false premise that if we push back against this, the Iranians would walk from the deal. My thought on that is if they walk, they walk. But it's not an easy decision for them. And we shouldn't hold our policy hostage to that. 

Let's move around to some of these other easily addressable problems. You live in a world of easily addressable problems. North Korea, so it has been reported that during the transition, the Obama administration basically warned the Trump, incoming Trump administration, to keep their eye on North Korea, that this could become the sleeper problem that could consume this administration. Is that how you see it? 

Yes, it is exactly what I would have told. I had this sort of formula. It's our move, their move, no move, all right, our move's Syria, OK. We've got to go do something. No move, I think Russia and China. I think they're going to ground a little bit to kind of figure out where these guys are going. Their move, North Korea. You know as well as I, Dan, we've experienced this. Their foreign policy looks like it was written on the bottom of a shampoo bottle, OK. Provoke, accept concessions, repeat, provoke, and they're going to provoke. They're going to create a crisis. 

And U.S. response should be? 

Well actually, that's a really tough question. That is a genuinely wicked problem. The Obama administration -- and I must admit for a while, I thought this was the right hand. The Obama administration has used what they call strategic patience, which means pay no attention to the three year old throwing his porridge on the floor. He just wants your attention. 

Right. 

Pay no attention to him. Well, we've tried that for eight years, and now they're just a few years away from an ICBM capable of reaching Seattle. 

Right. 

So that's probably not working out as well as we would hope. And so now -- there are no easy choices. We could break right which would be a more aggressive policy towards the North Koreans, actually trying to stop them from developing. We could break left, which means we're going to decide to live with a nuclear North Korea, and we're going to make our peace with that fact. Or we could try one more time to have the approach I call actions have consequences, which means -- are you familiar with THAAD, the theater high altitude air defense we put in South Korea and the Chinese are going crazy. I think we need to go to the Chinese and say, yes, that's the stuff that happens when you let this guy do that. Oh, by the way, I think we'll put THAAD in Japan as well. And you know what, those nuclear capable ships that used to come here, yes, they're going to come back again. And you know what, we used to keep nuclear weapons in Kunsan. We still have the bunkers. I mean -- I don't mean to be bellicose to the Chinese, but to simply say, he does this, we've got to go do stuff. It's not intended for you, I know you think it is, but it's not. But we're going to do what we've got to go do. And maybe that incentivizes the Chinese to increase the torque. 

Let's move to Russia. You talked about Russia before. So as analysts try to understand, public analysts, not analysts in the agency, in the intelligence communities. Analysts try to understand what it seems to be the Trump administration's motivation for seeming, you know, warming of relations with Vladimir Putin and his government. To give them the benefit of the doubt, there is a worldview out there that basically says America is no longer in an ideological struggle in the world. America is in a civilizational struggle. And the other side, the adversary in our civilization struggle for survival, for the survival of western civilization as we know it is radical Islam, we were talking about earlier. And Russia, while we may not like what they do in their own backyard, and while we may not like what they do in their neighborhood, we shouldn't let what they may or may not do to, in Ukraine, or potentially in the future in Lithuania or Estonia, bother us or get in the way of cooperation in working with Russia to combat the threat of radical Islam. That is, I mean, that is the school of thought out there. I don't necessarily agree with it, but that is the school of thought. 

I understand. 

How do you respond to that? 

I think the premise is wrong. Remember, I said this is not yet a war between civilizations. So we've got a disagreement on the premise. But let's put that aside. Let's just agree for exercise purposes. Let's go implement it, all right? So how do you explain putting their arms around the Iranians and putting their other arms around Hezbollah? 

Right. 

You can't -- you can't picture two more violent actors in the Middle East with regard to radical Islam than these two Shia expressions of radical Islam. So I don't know that they've signed up to, let's go fight the radical Islam fight. I mean the president was fond of saying during the campaign that Russia is fighting ISIS. That's untrue. 

Right. 

They've hardly dropped a bomb on ISIS. They're fighting the more or less moderate opposition that we thought might have offered an alternative to the Bashar al-Assad regime. All they want to do is keep the Alawites, their own form of Shia radicalism, in power because it suits not the war of civilizations narrative, because it suits their naked Russian geopolitical ambitions to have a foothold in the Middle East. 

And so, to your point, Russia is helping Syria bomb Aleppo, not Raqqa where ISIS is headquartered. 

Exactly. 

They're actually contributing to the catastrophe, the human suffering. 

Yes. And so, if you think Syria is a problem you have to solve, if you're going to solve the broader question of radical Islam, the presence of that Alawite regime is the engine that continually fuels Sunni opposition which, the longer it goes, is more and more captured by the Sunnis who are not just willing to kill but are willing to die, the radicals. 

OK. So let's talk about this book, "Playing to the Edge," which is a fantastic, if not at times, unnerving read. Not bedtime reading, shall we say. It's read it during the day while the sunlight is out, so you don't get totally freaked out and depressed. What has been the reaction to the book? I mean, you address some pretty, as you call them, grey areas, some really morally, some would say morally ambiguous decisions that you had to make almost every single day. 

You bet. 

What's the reaction? 

So, "Playing to the Edge," I mean, it's designed to be, and it is, Dan, unapologetic. This is what we did. I don't have any regrets. Let me explain to you why we did it. I understand you may disagree, that's OK. We share values and we're just disagreeing on this. Not an argument between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. But you may disagree. And so, I began the book tour on the hard cover almost a year ago today. I took it on the road. And, you know, Dan, I have my personal fingerprints on every controversial program we've engaged in since 9/11. I've done the surveillance program at NSA. I created it. I inherited and then implemented renditions, detentions, interrogation programs at the CIA. And I played a very strong role in convincing the Bush administration in 2007-2008 to amp up the targeted killing program, check, check, check, check, check. I've got them all. And again, not apologetic. So I took it on the road. And frankly, I was prepared to be in a rope-a-dope from time to time depending on the audiences, and that turned out not to be the case. There actually is, I think, a fair amount of understanding of the American people that these are tough choices. And even those who disagreed, appreciated the candor, the honesty with which I said here's why we did what we did. I get your objection, but there's another dynamic too, that you might find interesting. So I'm out there a year ago, just as this campaign is getting under way. And so, I'm out there thinking I'm going to spend a heck of a lot of time explaining why we are playing to the edge. And because of the rhetoric of the campaign, Dan, from certain candidates. 

Right. 

I spent as much time talking about why there are edges and why we shouldn't go beyond them. Because some people in the campaign were talking about carpet bombing, killing terrorists' families, waterboarding is too good for people, and so on. And so it was a fascinating exercise for me, the playing to the edge guy, the guy with his fingerprints on all this, actually telling American audiences, no, no, no, no. There are things we shouldn't do. There are limits beyond which we should not go. 

So I just want to zero in for our viewers, just to understand the kind of decisions you had to make at a very micro-level day to day. So you talk, for instance, in the book about making a decision about a targeted killing of an al-Qaeda leader, but if you, in this particular case if you struck the al-Qaeda leader, you would kill -- his grandson would be collateral damage in the operation. 

What I talked about was the first targeted killing that the United States government took after President Bush, in the middle of 2008, began to ramp up the program. And the individual involved was Khabab al-Masri, who was the WMD maestro for al-Qaeda, and somebody we were spending an awful lot of treasure and putting a lot of people at risk to find. And we had the intelligence that we knew where he was. We knew that was him. But in the travel region of Pakistan, it's really hot in the summer, people sleep outdoors, families go out there and put out cots. And he unfortunately was there with his entourage, and unfortunately, with some members of his family including his grandson. And so we had to make the decision. We had to contribute to the government's decision, do we take the shot or not? And again, WMD. 

Right. 

And the United States government decided to take the shot. The shot was taken. He was killed, that's the good news. His grandson was killed too, that's the bad news. 

The terror attacks we've seen in Europe, Paris, Nice, Brussels, I can go on, Germany. In so many of those kinds of attacks, they are not so much like we experienced here with San Bernardino, for instance, which more seemed like a lone wolf operation, whereas there -- 

These were planning cells launched by the mothership to come into Europe. 

Right. And they incubate in Europe. And they've plenty of time and space and infrastructure and resources to organize. Why don't we see that kind of thing here? Is it just a matter of time before we do? 

Yes. Probably, but, all right. 

Looking forward to the but. 

Yes, there are important differences. One is geography. They can't walk here, all right. And another is demographics. There're far higher proportion, I mean you got a million refugees in Germany. 

Right. 

You got a significant number in France. We don't have that. Which brings me back to the previous debate. We're probably hyperventilating about the refugee threat here. We had 10,000 Syrians last year. 

Right. 

Not a million. Beyond that, we're actually pretty good at this, I mean, our intelligence services are actually world-class and we're a tough target, Dan. And our services are actually pretty tough. Back to "Playing to the Edge," we do a lot of things that make the Europeans kind of get a little fidgety in their seats when it comes to making sure our people are safe. And then one more thing, this is actually really important for the intel guy to tell you. We're a welcoming society. We know how to assimilate people. Our European friends don't. We do have radicalized individuals in America. We don't have radicalized communities. And we don't because of who we are. It brings us all the way back to the first conversation about the ban. You need to be careful about the second and third order effects of things, even if they are legitimate self-defense steps. 

Over in the region where a lot of these individuals come from, at first, Middle East, parts of the Sunni Middle East. Growing cooperation now really is a surprise to many of us the last few years between the government of Israel and the Sunni Arab -- someone had a very good line, you know, that sure enough, President Obama actually did bring the Arabs and the Israelis together. 

Yes, he did. 

So, you know, in terms, they do a lot of intelligence sharing from what I understand, there's much more strategic cooperation. How important is it? How real is it? 

It is real and it is important. The normal rhythm for a CIA chief going to that part of the world is in one sequence or another, do the Emirates, do the Saudis, do the Jordanians, do the Israelis, and do the Egyptians? So in essence you're sweeping up the Sunnis and the Israelis. Why do you do it that way? Because you hear the same thing in all the capitals. 

Right. 

They all have the same worldview. And they all want to talk about one thing. And it's not each other, it's Iran. 

Iran. 

And they're focused on Iran. I used to go visit Saudi Arabia and I talked a bit about this. I would visit with his majesty king Abdullah. The first lesson you've got to draw is the king of Saudi Arabia has time for the director of the CIA. That describes what kind of relationship we have with the kingdom. And his majesty, and the ambassador would always come back. 

In four minutes. 

Yes. And he'll always be the translator. And his majesty would give us three to five minutes on the plight of the Palestinians, all right. And then, Dan, you could almost see him go. 

Right, right. 

And then, he would immediately launch into what he wanted to talk about, which was he would begin by describing the Iranian threat. 

Right. 

And then when he got really warmed up it was the Persians. And when he really got going it was the Shia. 

Right. 

All right. So you've got this convergence of self-interest between the Sunni states and the Israelis with regard to the dominant threat in the region which is the Iranians. 

And also, one would think, I agree that Iran is number one on the common threat list. Also the rise of the Muslim brotherhood, Sunni extremism is a threat, it's a threat inside Gaza and the West Bank, so Israel has a reason to be concerned about it. And it's a threat to Sisi in Egypt. It's a threat to King Abdullah in Jordan. 

Yes. 

One would think the Gulf Sunni states. 

Yes. You know, life's complicated, right? 

Right. 

We've just talked about a whole bunch of monarchies, not republics, other than Israel, right. 

Right. 

And so, I guess the question I'd ask you is so what is the future of political Islam, right? 

Right. 

Where does Islam go, going forward, in a world in which not every country is a monarchy? In which you have republics. I kind of hold up my hand here and say if this arm here is the Sunni root, OK, you've got a variety of expressions of Sunni political Islam. You've got ISIS over here. You've got al-Qaeda over here. You got Hamas here. You got the brotherhood here. And you've got the AKP in Turkey here. And you drive far enough down my arm, Dan, you got common roots. 

Right. 

All right. And so where does that go? This one over here, AKP, and again, I discuss it a bit in the book, Condi thought that was political Islam we could bet on. This is Erdogan in Turkey and so -- and you know, I think she was right for a while. But unfortunately about 2011, 2012, I think Erdogan got off the democracy bus. 

Right. President Obama thought too, we could work with Erdogan. 

Yes. And so, besides all the other second and third order effects that created in the region, the fact that it kind of stopped the engine going forward on the development of political Islam is another great sadness. So it's a really complicated puzzle here. Because, frankly, I mean, I know what Sisi is doing in Egypt, right? My last international, almost my last international trip was Egypt, and Mubarak harangued me for over an hour complaining about President Bush and Secretary Rice about the freedom agenda. I understand what's going on here. I've got the situation in control. 

He said that, Mubarak. 

He said that, yes. It turns out he didn't. And so, Arab autocracy, OK, is a cul-de-sac. 

Right. 

It's not a highway. And so we can't live with Arab autocracy forever. So how do we end up with a political Islam that they and we can live with? 

General Hayden, thank you for a, always -- not to say upbeat, but certainly illuminating discussion. "Playing to the Edge" is the book, which I highly recommend. It's a terrific read and it's as relevant today if not more than it was when it first came out. So thank you for being here and joining us. 

Thank you, great seeing you again.
