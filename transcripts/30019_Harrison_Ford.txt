Unknown Speaker:His characters have been legendary -- Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Jack Ryan, even the president of the United States. In his latest film, Six Days, Seven Nights, he plays a cargo pilot stranded on a desert island with Anne Heche. (excerpt from ''Six Days, Seven Nights'') 

Harrison Ford:What are you taking now? 

Anne Heche:Xanac. My doctor prescribed them for situations of tension. 

Harrison Ford:Give me those. 

Anne Heche:Woo, hey, that was close, hunh? Woo. 

Harrison Ford:That was more than close. That hit us. It fried the radios. 

Anne Heche:Oh, no. That's bad, hunh? 

Harrison Ford:Mayday, mayday, mayday. Beaver-zero-three-one-eight, unable to maintain altitude. Anybody hear this? Mayday, mayday, mayday. 

Anne Heche:Attention, K-Mart shoppers. Snow shovels are on sale at $12.99. 

Harrison Ford:Put that down. I'm unable to maintain altitude, 40 miles south-southeast of Makatea (sp). 

Anne Heche:(singing) Mayday, mayday, mayday. 

Harrison Ford:How many of those things did you take? 

Anne Heche:Um, you know, I just don't know. 

Harrison Ford:Look-- 

Anne Heche:What? 

Harrison Ford:We're in trouble here. I want you to sit back, be quiet, and keep your seat belt tight and let me fly this thing. 

Charlie Rose:I am pleased to have HARRISON FORD back on this broadcast. Welcome back. 

Harrison Ford:Thank you. Pleased to be here. 

Charlie Rose:How are you? 

Harrison Ford:I'm OK. 

Charlie Rose:OK. Let me tell you what's interesting to me. We were talking about this before. You-- and I think this was in the paper, so this is no secret. 

Harrison Ford:So it must be true. 

Charlie Rose:Exactly. If I read it, it's gotta be true. You know? I mean, that's what I've grown up on-- America, that if it's printed or if it's on television it has to be true. You are now somewhere in the vicinity of 30 miles from where we sit practicing helicopter landings and whatever. You've got your helicopter license. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:You're big-time into helicopters. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Why is that? 

Harrison Ford:Oh, it's just-- It was a fun thing to do. When I was in Kauai making Six Days, Seven Nights, we were often transported to distant locations or inaccessible locations in a helicopter and a couple or three flights I persuaded the pilot to put the duals in and began to fly. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:And by the time I left Kauai I had about 25 hours, and I really enjoyed it. I like all flying-- all kinds of flying. 

Charlie Rose:But you like this more than flying your-- I think you have a Beech-- 

Harrison Ford:I have-- 

Charlie Rose:A bunch of planes. 

Harrison Ford:A bunch of planes. But this is totally different set of skills. It's a different set of-- the mechanical systems are far different. And so it intrigued me, and it was also hard to do at first. And so that hooked me. 

Charlie Rose:Why is it hard to do? 

Harrison Ford:Well, it's the mix of inputs that you have to give the helicopter to make it do what you want it to do. You-- both of your feet are working, in a different way than they work in an airplane. Both of your hands are occupied. So, it's a bit like-- It's one of these things, you know? (rubs stomach and top of head) 

Charlie Rose:Can you do that? 

Harrison Ford:No. 

Charlie Rose:People have told me, though, that if you are a pilot-- 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:If you can fly as you can-- you can even fly jets, yes? 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Then it's easier to learn 'cause you've gone through the process before. 

Harrison Ford:Well, a lot things (crosstalk) 

Charlie Rose:Some of the things are translatable. 

Harrison Ford:A lot of the things that you have to know -- all of the radio communications, all of the other stuff is taken care of. You know that stuff already. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:But flying the helicopter-- you can often-- you can get yourself in trouble flying a helicopter if, when things go wrong, your instinctive-- your airplane instincts take over. 

Charlie Rose:Ah. Is it too late for me to start-- to learn to fly? 

Harrison Ford:No. 

Charlie Rose:Assuming I'm mentally capable of doing it. 

Harrison Ford:That's an easy assumption to make. I've met a lot of pilots. Believe me, you're capable. 

Charlie Rose:And could I-- should I just learn how to fly a helicopter because with my life it would be better 'cause I'm not gonna be flying a plane a long distance. What I want it to do is to fly short hops. 

Harrison Ford:Sure. 

Charlie Rose:That would be best for me. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Just to go ahead and learn how to-- And then I wouldn't have the problem you just noted, which is I don't have anything to unlearn. 

Harrison Ford:That would be great. 

Charlie Rose:Or I don't have anything that's gonna give me a different instinct in a moment of crisis. 

Harrison Ford:No, that's-- I think that's a good idea. 

Charlie Rose:Well, this is great. 

Harrison Ford:I'll set you up. 

Charlie Rose:OK, now how long would it take me to learn? 

Harrison Ford:It depends on how much-- how much time you devote to it. 

Charlie Rose:Like everything else, yeah. 

Harrison Ford:You know, when I set out to finally complete the process-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:--after I had about 40 hours. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Harrison Ford:It took me two weeks to get ready to take my tests and to face the oral exam and the-- and the flight exam. 

Charlie Rose:The thing you love about flying-- let me guess. It is that it is totally absorbing. 

Harrison Ford:Mm-hmm. 

Charlie Rose:Nothing else. 

Harrison Ford:That's a very big part of it. I am free of the residual effects of other parts of my life. 

Charlie Rose:Everything. 

Harrison Ford:Well, you know, pretty much. 

Charlie Rose:You have to. It's like brain surgery. You gotta focus. 

Harrison Ford:You do have to focus, and the pleasure is in that kind of complete application to the moment. 

Charlie Rose:Do you find that in acting? 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:You do? 

Harrison Ford:Yeah, when I'm acting, not when I'm sitting around thinking about acting. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, when you're actually doing it. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:When you're somewhere else. You're so into a character, is that-- 

Harrison Ford:I'm not so into a character than I'm not aware of everything around me. I don't-- it doesn't work that way for me. But I get so into making the movie, telling the story, that I'm completely absorbed by that exercise, and I don't think about other things. 

Charlie Rose:Is the greatest-- the best thing about being HARRISON FORD in mid-life-- you look at me, ''Where the hell is he going?'' It is that you can pretty much do-- money's no-- money's off the table as a consideration. Health is a consideration. The welfare of your children and family is a consideration. Continuing your relationship with television-- with audiences is a consideration, but you can pretty much do what you want to do. Right? 

Harrison Ford:At my risk because they-- you know, everyone likes to put people in boxes and-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:--when the want a certain thing they open the box and if-- if-- you know, if you've changed somehow that makes people uncomfortable. 

Charlie Rose:Does it-- so, you're restrained in terms of what you can do in terms of walking away from or diverging from their perception of you? 

Harrison Ford:Well, you have to work a little bit harder at it. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:You have to-- part of-- you have to make sure that the fit is correct to the thing you're trying to change a little bit. But really-- 

Charlie Rose:The thing about being a romantic hero, a kind of, you know-- 

Harrison Ford:The only thing there's any unanimity on is the kind of work that I do in action films. 

Charlie Rose:Everybody loves it. 

Harrison Ford:They can-- you know, they love it up to a certain point. It ain't brain surgery. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Harrison Ford:It's not Shakespeare, but that's OK. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Harrison Ford:That's good. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Harrison Ford:If I try and do comedy -- as I do from time to time -- or another kind of thing, then I do so at my-- at my peril. 

Charlie Rose:Is there -- and don't push away from the analogy -- a touch of Michael Jordan in you? In a sense that being the champion of the world -- and you are in terms of box office -- I mean, look at the two movies you made last year in 1997. You made more money than any other actor in terms of the box office of your movies. Right? 

Harrison Ford:Um-- 

Charlie Rose:Air Force One and whatever-- 

Harrison Ford:If you're pushin' towards a question, I didn't want to divert you, but I didn't make that money. My films didn't make that money. You know, some of those were George Lucas films. Some of those were Steven Spielberg films. Some of those were Mike Nichols films. 

Charlie Rose:Right, right, right. 

Harrison Ford:You know, I don't do that alone. I've been a lucky guy, and the films I've been in over 25 years-- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:--made a certain amount of money, and this is the way people-- this is the sort of the stamp on my bottom. 

Charlie Rose:What? What's the stamp? He made the-- that's right-- in other words, highest-- 

Harrison Ford:''Made a lot of money.'' 

Charlie Rose:''Most bankable.'' ''Made a lot of movie.'' 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:And does it displease you? Does it bother you that that's part of it? And would you rather they said something else other than that? 

Harrison Ford:Probably. 

Charlie Rose:You would? 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:Like what? 

Harrison Ford:Well, I'd probably rather that people-- I don't know. 

Charlie Rose:I would like to know. 

Harrison Ford:I would like that people understood what it is that people do, what making movies is about. I don't want to take the time to explain, Charlie-- 

Charlie Rose:No, but I'm-- but I-- but-- 

Harrison Ford:There's such a misunderstanding about what it is that one does, and that's 

Ok:I know. 

Harrison Ford:--is not-- is not-- it doesn't sit well with me. 

Charlie Rose:What would sit better, for example, is ''the guy who created -- in concert with directors and screenwriters -- interesting characters that you wanted to watch.'' That's a little better? 

Harrison Ford:That's part of it. I just want-- you know, I would-- You always-- I suppose you always want what you ain't got, you know? And, if I really wanted to be appreciated as an actor, I probably should do different kinds of work than I do. But I think I suffer a little from people's judgment of my work. 

Charlie Rose:What are you-- 

Harrison Ford:I'm not good about that. 

Charlie Rose:What do you mean, you're not good about it? 

Harrison Ford:Oh, I mean it pisses me off. 

Charlie Rose:That's what I thought. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. I don't like it. I'm not good about that. 

Charlie Rose:It gets under your skin. So, you're not good about saying, ''Well, screw you if that's what you think. I don't care what you think. You characterize me. You know, you can stamp me with whatever you want to--'' 

Harrison Ford:If they get in my brain, it's not that easy to get 'em out. 

Charlie Rose:So, why don't you-- 

Harrison Ford:Do Shakespeare? 

Charlie Rose:Well, not Shakespeare. 

Harrison Ford:Well, but that's what it takes. 

Charlie Rose:Does it? 

Harrison Ford:Well, I don't know. What does it take? 

Charlie Rose:I don't know. I don't know. 

Harrison Ford:I don't know what it takes. 

Charlie Rose:But, if I were you and it bothered me, I think I'd probably try to find out. 

Harrison Ford:Well, I think that's the wrong way to go because I think I do as well as can do in the things that I do. And when I-- you know, over the broad range of films that I've done, a lot of 'em have been acting pieces. And I have certainly had people who appreciated the work, and there have been occasions when the work has not been really, frankly, good enough to be appreciated. But, you know, you make films for different reasons. You make film for-- that are entertainments. You take-- certain films you do because they emotionally appeal to you or are intrigued by them. But in general-- I guess it's what's left unsaid after you say, ''Well, he's the guy who makes all the money.'' 

Charlie Rose:Could you argue that you have chose superbly well in terms of the roles you've chose to play, have been-- or could you say, ''Well, because I haven't-- because I'm not satisfied with some of the things I've done that I haven't necessarily chose well''? How do you see that on balance in terms of what you have chose to do? Forget what the-- 

Harrison Ford:I think I've chosen pretty well. I think I, you know, mixed up the kinds of things that I've done, changed a bit, gone from one genre to another so as not to get stuck in one place, genre-wise. I like-- I have never felt that I, you know, made a terrible choice. They are things that I wanted to do. If they didn't play so well in Peoria or in New York, that's fine, you know, in general. 

Charlie Rose:Let me go back to my-- just because I don't want to lose it-- people think that I forget-- my Michael Jordan thing-- you-- beyond being-- forget the bankable thing, which you interrupted me when I was going to go to something akin to that-- to save you goin' there, let me just say this -- I'm not thrilled by that kind of nomenclature. Suppose, in fact, I said there is something, though. You like the notion that you make movies that connect with an audience and that you are the guy that does that better than anyone else, period. Forget everything else. You like that you create characters and that you are the heavyweight champion of that. Doesn't that mean something to you? 

Harrison Ford:No. 

Charlie Rose:It doesn't? 

Harrison Ford:No. 

Charlie Rose:So, the Michael Jordan thing doesn't apply? 

Harrison Ford:No, look. I like making money. I'm in a business, and I like the fact that films have made money. If you take that success-- you know, if that success-- if you're lucky enough to have that kind of thing happen to you, then the next step's up to you. What are you gonna do with that? And I've continued to do what I always did, which was to make films that I thought would entertain people -- unpretentious, perhaps, kinds of films, most of them. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. And that means that you would not go out and take a risk to make a film that you didn't think was gonna be hugely successful as an entertainment vehicle because of all kinds of demands? 

Harrison Ford:Well, I don't know if I'd-- you know, I would take the risk if everybody else involved was knowing taking a risk that they were making a little art film, you know, or whatever. 

Charlie Rose:Before I see one last clip of this movie, tell me about this movie. Cargo pilot. 

Harrison Ford:I read a script that came across my desk that I laughed at. I was lookin' for a comedy, and I read a lot of comedies-- 

Charlie Rose:So, when you laughed, you said, ''This must be good.'' 

Harrison Ford:Well, I said, ''It must be funny.'' 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Harrison Ford:And a lot of what-- you know, what is declared comedy doesn't make me laugh, and there were about five, six, seven times as I was reading this script where I laughed out loud or laughed. And that's-- that was a lot. And I hadn't done a comedy for a while, wanted to do something to contrast what I have lately done. It was a character different to what I've lately done. It was gonna shoot in Kauai in the summer and the kids could all go along. 

Charlie Rose:You're now explaining all the joys of your business. 

Harrison Ford:I get to fly airplanes in it. I thought it would an entertaining film. That's-- I should have said that first. When I read it, I saw a movie that-- 

Charlie Rose:Thought it would be entertaining. 

Harrison Ford:I saw a movie I thought people would want to go to, they'd have a good movie experience with. 

Charlie Rose:As we go out, here's a clip from Six Days and Seven Nights. One of my favorite people, HARRISON FORD. Will you-- I'd like to go on this helicopter with you. 

Harrison Ford:You're on. 

Charlie Rose:Can you arrange that? 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. Absolutely. 

Charlie Rose:OK. Great to see you again. 

Harrison Ford:Thanks. 

Charlie Rose:Back in-- (both men start laughing as the grab for a tabloid on the table) 

Harrison Ford:Give me that. 

Charlie Rose:Let me just tell you what this is, America. Now, this morning I'm out-- this is a true story. I'm out and I stop to get gas at the Mobil gas station. And, while my tank is filling up, I go there and there's a newsstand and they have these magazines there. I'm attracted to the idea-- it says, ''Diane Sawyer trims her butt on cabbage-soup diet.'' So, I said, ''That's a story I want to read.'' And so I go to read that story, and very close to that story is the following, and I thought, ''This is research for tonight.'' ''Ten things you didn't know about HARRISON FORD,'' -- none of it bad. For example, number one is, ''Whenever he gets a chance, handyman Harrison likes to relax by fixing pal's cars.'' When was the last time you fixed a pal's car? 

Harrison Ford:That's-- the-- that's not true. 

Charlie Rose:Not true. All right. Let's see what else. ''He's a great gourmet with a wine cellar worth $250,000. His favorite is Romani Conti (sp) Burgundy 1985 at $2,500 a pop.'' 

Harrison Ford:My God, no. 

Charlie Rose:Not true again? 

Harrison Ford:No, no, not true. 

Charlie Rose:But you are a-- you love wine. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. Let's open a bottle of that right now, but I don't have one. 

Charlie Rose:You don't? Have you ever? Do you like it? Do you know anything about that particular-- 

Harrison Ford:Sure, but I would never spend-- 

Charlie Rose:Twenty-five hundred dollars? 

Harrison Ford:Dollars, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:''Turned down the role of Meathead in the classic television series, All in the Family, because he was offended by Archie Bunker's racist character.'' 

Harrison Ford:Never got offered the role. 

Charlie Rose:Never got offered the role, but they talked to somebody about it? Might-- there's a kernel of truth maybe. ''The three most important things in his life are his kids--'' 

Harrison Ford:Yeah. Well-- 

Charlie Rose:''--family -- wife, kids -- a good bed, comfortable shoes, and practical clothing.'' That's true. 

Harrison Ford:Yeah, yeah. No argument with that. 

Charlie Rose:Pretty good. Yeah. ''Credits his trim figure to vigorous workouts on the tennis court.'' When was the last time you played tennis? 

Harrison Ford:I play all the time. 

Charlie Rose:There we go. So, that may be true. 

Harrison Ford:But ask me when is the last time I had a trim figure. That'll be a while. 

Charlie Rose:''But doing his own screen tests-- his own screen stunts has taken a toll. He's got bad knees and a bad back.'' 

Harrison Ford:I got bad knees and a bad back, but I don't do stunts. You know that. 

Charlie Rose:''He's an action star now, but admits he was a runty kid.'' 

Harrison Ford:I was a runty kid. 

Charlie Rose:You were a runty kid? 

Harrison Ford:Not runty. Just-- 

Charlie Rose:I didn't think so either. Keep a-coming, my friend. 

Harrison Ford:Thanks for having me. 

Charlie Rose:Pleasure as always. 

Harrison Ford:Thanks. 

Charlie Rose:Back in a moment. Stay with us. HARRISON FORD. (excerpt from ''Six Days, Seven Nights'') 

Harrison Ford:Here. 

Anne Heche:Where? Where? 

Harrison Ford:Somewhere between Makatea and Tahiti. That's the best I can do for you. 

Anne Heche:Whoa. What happened? 

Harrison Ford:Hit. 

Anne Heche:Well, are you gonna fix it? I mean, can't we reattach it somehow? 

Harrison Ford:Oh, sure. We'll, like, glue it back on. How's that? 

Anne Heche:Aren't you one of those guys? 

Harrison Ford:What guys? 

Anne Heche:Those guy guys, you know? Those guys with skills. 

Harrison Ford:Skills? 

Anne Heche:Yeah. You send them out into the wilderness with a pocket knife and a q-tip and they build you a shopping mall. You can't do that? 

Harrison Ford:No. No, I can't do that. But I can do this. (sticks finger in his mouth and makes a popping sound) Does that help? Analysts Say Europe, U.S.
