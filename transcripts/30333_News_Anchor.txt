We begin this evening with the bombing today in St. Petersburg, Russia, at least 11 people were killed after a bomb exploded on a subway. A separate shrapnel-filled explosive device was later found and disarmed at another subway station. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Russian president Vladimir Putin was in St. Petersburg for the day and said that terrorism is being considered as a possible cause. For more on that developing story, we turn to coverage on the CBS Evening News. 

The blast was strong enough to blow out the subway doors. Some passengers pulled others off the train, but some died on the spot. Amateur video shows the chaos and shock underground as dazed commuters tried to figure out what had happened. The explosion took place between stations, but the train carried on through the tunnel to the next stop where the wounded poured up and out onto the streets. Investigators say they found a second bomb at another station which they diffused. It was hidden under a fire extinguisher and they say had it gone off, the blast would have been even more powerful than the first. President Vladimir Putin speaking in his hometown of St. Petersburg today said investigators would pursue all leads. Islamic extremists from the north caucuses have attacked Russian public transport before. Their most recent subway attack was in 2010, when two suicide bombers killed at least 40 people in the Moscow Metro. But since then, Russia has joined in Syria's messy civil war and that may have put it squarely in the crosshairs of ISIS. 

We begin this evening with politics. President Trump will meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort this Thursday and Friday. It is their first meeting and a crucial diplomatic test for the leaders of the world's two largest economies. On Sunday, the "Financial Times" published an extensive interview with President Trump. Among the revelations was the willingness of the White House to act unilaterally against North Korea in the absence of cooperation from Beijing. Joining me now is Gillian Tett, she is the U.S. managing editor of the "Financial Times." She was one of three editors from the paper who sat down with President Trump in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon. This is the coverage they're giving it. Look at this. 

Well, it is the president of the United States. You don't often get a chance to speak to him and we're very grateful that we did. 

And it made headlines around the world because of what he said first about North Korea. A question you asked? 

I did ask the question about North Korea because I think it's critically important. We spent much of the last two years worrying about Syria, worrying about Iran, worrying about Russia, for understandable reasons, but what's happening right now in North Korea is critical. And frankly, it needs to be talked about. 

Well, I mean, are they talking about it? Do they seem to be not only talking about it but worrying about it? Everybody you talk to, as you know, says the key to North Korea is you have to go through China. 

Well, the key to dealing with North Korea is indeed China because about 70 percent of the food and energy is thought to come from China. And if they turn off the taps, then North Korea will have a problem. Unfortunately, it does look as if some of China's leverage over North Korea recently has diminished a little bit. But a key part -- 

And the reverse is true. They seem to be less willing to do everything North Korea says or wants. 

Certainly at the moment, China is less willing to do everything North Korea wants. It does look as if relations are deteriorating a bit. And the recent assassination that took place in North Korea was quite symbolic because it means most of the Chinese-educated officials inside North Korea are no longer within the inner circle. But nobody can have any doubt that the U.S. administration believes that China is critical to trying to rein in North Korea, and so it's going to be absolutely center stage of the meeting in Mar-a-Lago on Thursday and Friday. 

Along with trade and South China. 

Along with trade and South China. Because the critical thing to understand is that increasingly people are saying that these issues shouldn't be looked at in isolation. On Friday, the White House released news about its big trade review. And certainly they're having tough conversations with China about the trade issue. And they've been beating the drum on that quite a bit. But the question people are asking is could the White House use the trade talks as part of a bargaining chip to try and get some grand deal over the Korean peninsula? Hard to see at the moment but certainly that is in discussion right now. 

Back to North Korea. So what did you ask the president? 

I asked the president whether he was concerned about North Korea, whether he thought there could be some kind of discussion, meaningful discussion. And if the Chinese were not willing to play ball, what exactly where they going to do? 

And he said? 

He indicated that he was -- 

He indicated or he said? 

He said that he was certainly going to raise it with the Chinese. That he hoped they would play ball, and essentially be cooperative and work together. He said that if that happened, that could be very good, dropping hints about the trade issues. And that if it doesn't, it was going to be bad. And he indicated -- or he said that the U.S. would go it alone. Later on, he also had -- 

But when he said it, did he say, that's all I'm going to say? 

That was all he was gonna say. He said they would go it alone. He did not indicate whether that meant militarily, or sanctions, or anything else. Because frankly, I don't think he knows. But he is certainly saber rattling. A lot of people would say, could the U.S. go it alone? Could the U.S. take military action to contain the nuclear threat from North Korea? The answer is, at the moment, not easily or not without a huge loss of life on the Korean peninsula. Could the U.S. use sanctions to rein in North Korea? Well, it's been trying to do that for some time, it's not worked. So there aren't any easy options for the U.S. to go it alone. 

Does this president believe that North Korea, if it has ICBM missiles that can deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States, is his biggest foreign policy challenge? Does he know that? Does he say that? Does he believe that? 

Well, I would hazard to guess that until recently, President Donald Trump wouldn't have been able to locate Pyongyang on a map. But I think he certainly does understand the gravity of the issue. And one very important detail about what is going on around the White House right now is that the NSC's been working on a review of the problems of North Korea, and the options for a response has actually accelerated it to make sure the review is in the president's hands before the meeting in Mar-a-Lago. And in fact, I believe it was probably in his hands on Friday. And we also interviewed Katie McFarland, the deputy, and she made it clear that she now thinks, as well as the NSC now think, that it's entirely possible that North Korea will have an intercontinental ballistic missile with nuclear warheads that could hit the West Coast of America by the end of President Trump's first term, if the current trajectory goes on unchecked. That's a scary thought. I mean, I was in San Francisco and Los Angeles last week. 

A very scary thought, and that's why President Obama said to him your biggest problem is going to be -- your biggest challenge will be North Korea. 

The thing I find amazing, I was in San Francisco and Los Angeles last week, and I said to a number of people as I was going around Silicon Valley and this all boom-boom sunshine, everything is growing, everything is wonderful. And I said to a couple of people, you know, are you worried about North Korea? And I might as well have said are you worried about planet Pluto? Because I don't think people have understood the threat at all. 

And did you talk about a One China policy? 

We talked about -- not so much One China policy. We talked about the wider question of the Asian region. But we didn't get into details about what his policy would be. The most intriguing comment he made during the interview was, and I quote, that it's possible that there could be a very big deal, that there could be some kind of bigger deal. I would not be at all surprised if we did something that would be very dramatic and good for both countries and I hope so. 

That sounds like some kind of grand bargain that he's thinking about. 

Now, you can dismiss that and say that's a Donald Trump, you know, off-the-cuff statement. Or you can say that actually, if you want to be optimistic, the very severity of the North Korean threat means that not only the U.S. is concerned right now but also China is pretty concerned too. Maybe just maybe, this could be the issue that breaks a logjam and forces these two huge countries to recognize they need to work together. Not just on the immediate issue of North Korea, but on a wider resolution in the South China Sea, in the Korean peninsula, and maybe on the trade front. 

And also climate. 

And also climate. Now it sounds hard to believe. And frankly, I find it hard to believe. But there is a seven-point plan floating around which would try to bring about some kind of wider bargain across the Korean peninsula, probably wouldn't be acceptable to the Japanese, let alone South Koreans, but it's floating around. So when Donald Trump says, you know, I would not be at all surprised if we didn't do something that would be very dramatic, maybe he's seen that plan. 

What was his overall demeanor? Did he -- was he calm, soft spoken? 

The president's overall demeanor seemed to be very positive, very cheerful. He was in a good mood. He was keen to be charming, but also firm. And, you know -- 

Keen to be charming, that's a British expression. 

Exactly. We arrived. He has this box with the button on the desk which looks rather uncannily like -- 

This was Friday afternoon. 

Friday afternoon. Looked a bit like something out of "Dr. Strangelove," box on the desk. We looked at the button going, wow. And he pushes the button and he calls up a diet coke. He used it to summon a Diet Coke. He's made jokes sometimes about -- 

He doesn't drink I'm told. 

He doesn't -- well -- no, he doesn't drink diet cola I'm told -- so we had Diet Coke. He showed us a picture of Andrew Jackson. He showed us around the office. He was very keen to, you know, be hospitable and gracious and show goodwill. 

So what do you make of his presidency so far? 

His presidency has certainly taken the rest of the world aback. It's been unconventional. It's been often frustrating and baffling. It's been exhausting as a journalist to cover it because we're dealing with Tweets at all hours of day and night. However, as we wrote in our piece today, he is an imperious president. He's an unconventional president. But there is a method in the madness, we think. 

What's the method. 

The method in the madness is really to do two of three things. First of all, to enable him to connect with the voters that he thinks brought him into office. Secondly, it's to -- if you like destabilize or surprise the people who he regards as his rivals, some will say that includes the media. And thirdly, it's to show that he is going to be unconventional. He wants to be a different type of president. 

So he believes in chaos and disruption? 

I don't know whether he had ever sat down and created a philosophy of chaos and disruption, but certainly his instincts are to be unconventional. And we asked him -- or rather I asked him whether he regretted any of these Tweets that have been coming out. And he said he doesn't do regrets. But he also said he's convinced that the Tweets won him the election. The Tweets are essentially what gives him the power of the presidency, and he's not going to stop any time soon. 

How did it win the election? 

Well, it basically enabled him -- 

It showed being disruptive. 

It enabled him to connect with the public. And at one point in the interview, he turned around and he said, tell me how many followers I've got now on Twitter, and they came back and they said a hundred million, and then he corrected him and said, no, 101 million. And he was very pleased. 

Why do you think he's still sensitive to any questions about winning the election and constantly refers to how well he did and all of that? Do you have any psychological insight on that? 

Actually, as we were writing the piece, he actually opened the interview by saying I won, you didn't. And, you know, it's an indication of his mentality. I'd say he puts the media in the camp of people with whom he's been battling over the last couple of years. I think he still feels the need to assert his position. And again, many people would say that's part of the unconventional strategy. Some people would say that shows a man who doesn't feel secure in the job yet. And others would say, well, actually, that's just being human. And part of what has enabled him to connect with voters is the fact that he is a no-holds-barred, tell-it-how-it-is, very, very human president who changes his mind, and says what he's feeling in a pretty unfiltered way. 

Do you believe, because this is in your arena, do you believe that the economic progress that we have seen, especially the market, will continue? 

That's a very interesting question, Charlie. Because during the course of the interview, we asked him about, you know, what his triumphs were, and when we spoke to people around him in the White House, and we did speak to a large array of people in the White House. And they repeatedly said, well, confidence is surging, stock market's up. And basically the mood has changed dramatically. And people in the White House regard that as a strong sign of what they have achieved. They could be right. Maybe there's going to be a self-reinforcing upsurge in animal spirits that actually will get the economy growing again. But one thing is very interesting right now and it's something that's worrying the fed and many economists. There is a big split between what they call the hard data and the soft data. The soft data is about sentiment, it's about consumer confidence and business confidence, and that is definitely rising. The hard data is about what's actually happening. 

Because business think there will be tax cuts and less regulation. 

Exactly. All basically are fed up with last few years of, you know, too many regulations and they're worried about quantitative easing. The hard data is not nearly as optimistic. That may be a time lag, maybe the hard data will improve as confidence feeds through. 

And the hard data is simply? 

Things like auto sales we had today. It's the GDP. It's retail spending. None of these figures have been that optimistic or that positive. They've been OK, but not great. So the question people are asking is, is this just a time lag effect and when businesses and consumers see President Trump's policies actually coming through, the actual underlying data will improve dramatically too. Or is it the case that people have drunk the Kool-aid around the presidency, and there's going to be a very nasty bought of disappointment going forward. 

There's this idea still, you know, well, we got -- we, being everybody -- got his election wrong and therefore, you can't really say that anything is bad now because in the end, like the election, he'll prevail. 

Well, at one point in the interview, President Trump pointed out that, you know, he predicted Brexit. He predicted all kinds of things. And frankly, he'd be a lot more correct in his predictions than many other people, including the media. And certainly, the White House thinks that they are on the right track, that many American voters are with them. Business confidence is rising. And their strategy is working. 

There's also this, which they obviously know. He does feel a strong connection to the people who elected him, or at least he gives expression to that. Yet some of the things that he's doing, the proposed budget, and health care, help, I mean hinder, hurt, take away things that that very constituency has considered important to their lives. 

I could not agree more, Charlie. Because there is this paradox, he has been elected as, supposedly, a man of the people. He's not a man of the people, in the sense that he's a billionaire, as he keeps telling us. And he's not behaving like somebody who wants to put the people's interests first in terms of the poorest people, in the sense that, you know, the tax cuts will end up favoring the rich, not the poor. His discussion about health-care reforms are things that actually would not help many of his voters. 

The people in his cabinet and the principal advisors are all very rich as we've just saw in an article over the weekend. 

Exactly, there is this extraordinary paradox. Now, again, you can be cynical and say that's one reason why he keeps stressing the Tweets. He keeps talking like somebody from the people. 

Beyond the idea of Tweets, how about the specific tweet about President Obama wanting to -- or having been part of wiretapping Trump Tower. 

We didn't discuss that particular one -- 

You didn't raise that particular one. 

No. 

Was that on purpose or... 

No, it's because you go into an interview and, frankly, I mean, we talked about the Tweets. He said at one stage, if you're going to make hundreds of Tweets, you're going to make a clinker there and then. And we were about to talk about and we started on North Korea. And frankly, right now, issues like North Korea and China are so important on the agenda, that, as with any interview, you go where the conversation goes. 

He faces a Congress now in which he has said he's going to take on the Freedom Caucus. 

Exactly. One of the very interesting details we asked him about was, what about health-care reform, is it dead and buried? Everybody in the White House was keen to stress it is not dead and buried. They claim there're still a lot of negotiations still going on. President Trump himself stressed that if the Freedom Caucus were not going to play ball, he would turn to the Democrats instead and try and get what he could -- 

He said that to you? 

He did, yes. And get a bipartisan deal. "If we don't get what we want," i.e., from the Freedom Caucus, "we will make a deal with the Democrats, and we will have, in my opinion, not as good a form of health care, but we're going to have a very good form of health care. It will be a bipartisan form of health care. 

So he's prepared to take them on. 

Judging from what he said. 

So far there's no indication -- one of the things they say that came out of the problems with passing health care was that the Freedom Caucus members are not intimidated by him. 

Yes, that much is very clear. 

Exactly. 

And when he says, I think he's going to be ruthlessly pragmatic. And, you know, we were told several times that negotiations are still under way and they will continue. And it was clear -- we were told that the reason why they had not conducted the vote was not because they were scared of losing, it's because they wanted to keep the door open for more negotiations. Like so much coming out of the White House right now, it's very hard to tell what is actually true or not. 

Based on the moment you walked into the White House, and the moment you left the White House, what did you learn that you didn't know or what perceptions did you have that were not confirmed, and in fact new ideas, new impressions were formed? 

Well, I think they basically come down to two or three. The first one is the issue of North Korea is center stage right now, and very important and very serious. I knew it was serious beforehand, but I came out, you know, aware that it was actually really serious. 

And that they were on top of it. 

That they certainly planned to make it a centerpiece of the summit in Mar-a-Lago. Because I think until two or three weeks ago, people were looking at this more in terms of the trade deal, or the trade issues, or the currency issues. So that's point one. Point two is, you know, it would re-affirm that he really does believe that Tweeting, his unorthodox style, is working. He's not going to change it. Anybody -- 

Even though -- 

Any journalist who hopes these Tweets stop, no chance of that. 

No, no, even though it creates distractions that get in the way of his message. 

Again, we asked him that, you know. I don't regret anything because there is nothing you can do about it. You know if you issue hundreds of Tweets and once in a while you have a clinker, that's not so bad. That pretty much -- 

But it's bad if it distracts from the central message because that's what -- 

He says I have over a hundred million followers between Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, over a hundred million. I don't have to go to the fake media. 

What's the fake media? 

You and me. 

I know that, but broadly. 

You know. 

Broadly is it anybody who writes things that he doesn't believe. 

Anything that is basically disintermediating him and the voters. You know, in some ways it's a bit like, you know, Franklin Roosevelt with the radio back in the 1930's. 

Kennedy with television. 

Exactly. You know, he wants to go directly to his base. 

FDR radio, Kennedy television. 

Exactly. So the f
