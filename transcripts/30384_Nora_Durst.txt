Carrie Coon is here. She stars in the acclaimed HBO drama "The Leftovers." The final season will begin airing on Sunday, April 16th. She plays Nora Durst, a woman who lost her husband and two children in an unexplained phenomenon when two percent of the world's population simply disappeared. "New York Magazine" named Coon the best actress on television in 2016. And here's a look at some of her work. 

I get it, I felt the same as you, I -- I felt responsible for losing my children. I thought it was my fault. But I moved passed it, I evolved... because that's pathetic. Terrible things happen in this world and the only comfort we get is that we didn't cause them. So, I'm sorry but, Erica, this had nothing to do with you. 

Did they depart or did they die? 

What? 

Your children, you said you lost them. Did they depart or did they die? 

They departed. 

What were the last words they said to you? To the best of your recollection? 

Coon will also star in this season of the Emmy award-winning epic series "Fargo." I'm pleased to have her here at this table for the first time. Welcome. 

Thank you so much. 

So "The Leftovers" is essentially about dealing with grief? 

Yes, it is, very much, yes. She's -- Nora is the ambassador of grief in her town. She is a statistical anomaly and she's the only person who's lost that many people and I find that though the show seems to deal with supernatural circumstances, it feels very real to me, you know. 

Meaning dealing with loss and departure -- 

Yes, absolutely. 

It happens to everybody. 

Most certainly, most certainly it does. And also, when Tom Perrotta wrote the book, it was really a bit of a rumination on 9/11. It was about collective grieving. What happens to an entire group of people when they are grieving together? And I think we see so many instances of that in our world, unfortunately now, where communities are traumatized and people have to deal with something collectively. He was very prescient in that way. So it always felt like a very truthful examination of what it was to be in grief. 

Was this the first move from the theater to film for you? 

It was. I had done some guest star spots and some commercial work. And at that point, I think we shot the pilot of The Leftovers" and then I booked "Gone Girl. So, I shot the film "Gone Girl" and that actually came out or started filming before I started the rest of the season of "Leftovers," so I had a lot of Fincher school before I got back. 

David Fincher, yes, yes, yes. 

I learned a lot. 

He's a good director to learn from. 

I mean, boy, the best. He was wonderful to me, so. 

I remember, as to the question of whether Affleck was going to be directing that or not. 

Yes. 

And it was clearly Fincher. If you want Fincher -- 

I had to say though Ben spent a lot of time just geeking out behind the camera with David and having great conversations about why he was making the decisions he was making. I think Ben learned a lot too. 

And he is one of those actors who proved that he can direct. 

Absolutely. He's an exceptional director. 

Was the transition difficult or not. 

From film? I mean, from theater to TV and film? You know, it's completely different, having come up through the Chicago scene, one of the benefits of that is that the market is much smaller so I had the opportunity to do a lot of commercial auditions. And so, I really learned to be on camera by going to, you know, sort of terrible inane commercial auditions for years. So I felt like I was ready. It's more -- it's just -- it's more about your face than your whole body I would say is the biggest difference. And also -- 

It's up close. 

That's right. And in the theater you tell the whole story from beginning to end, and in TV and film you just -- you tell it out of order, and they knock on your door at 2:00 a.m. and say, come on, cry now. 

But whereas in theater, you get to do it again and again and again. 

Right. 

So if you didn't do as well as you wanted to you get another shot tomorrow. 

That's right. 

But within film you get to try again and again and multiple takes. 

That's right. And you have the sort of -- you get the opportunity to kind of blow it out in that moment and not worry about having to repeat it the next day, which is really lovely but you also don't get the kind of dreaming time before you shoot something that you get in the theater. So you have to be very, the immediacy I've come to respect though. It was really challenging at first and I, boy, I really think very differently about those TV actors who make 22 episodes a year and come show up on the day and do that. It is a miracle anything is ever good. 

But are there nights in which you think you have pushed it to a level that you, much, much better than the previous night or the previous week, somehow because of some convergence, it is unbelievable and you wish that somebody, somewhere, caught this. 

Yes, absolutely, most certainly, yes. I mean, it is so ephemeral, the theater, isn't it? And certainly the audience is a character in the play, and boy, on a drunk Saturday night, they're not the best audience, you know, they're not the best scene partner. So yes, you do kind of wish you could preserve it I think. 

There is a great story which I'm sure you know about Laurence Olivier, I think, backstage after some brilliant performance and some other actor went back and said Larry, Larry, Larry, that was amazing. That was wonderful 

Right. 

How did you do it? And he says, "Oh, I wish I knew. I wish I knew." 

Yes. There is something very elusive about the art that, you know, even in TV. It's interesting because it seems that the camera knows - - your body knows when the camera is on your coverage. And your body helps you and responds. And then once the camera turns around -- 

Your body knows -- 

Yes, so, you know, when you're doing a scene. 

Right. 

You have to shoot both actors up close. 

Right, right, right. 

And so you're off camera for part of it and I always feel like my body knows when it's my coverage, right, and your body opens. 

It can feel the camera's presence. 

It can, sort of. And it opens space for you emotionally because once they turn around on the other actor, you almost can't -- you can't really re-create the experience for them entirely. There's always a little something held back from the other actor which is interesting. You want to give them as much as you can so they give you an authentic response in the scene. But there is something very elusive about that thing where the body seems to know. 

Which do you prefer? 

Oh, I think I'll always appreciate the theater. I mean, my husband is a playwright, he's -- and also. 

And a damn good one. 

A damn good one. I have to agree with you there. But it's -- 

I think he won a Pulitzer or something. 

He did, you know. He did, a Pulitzer, maybe a couple of Tony's. 

Yes, that too. 

But he's -- 

But and also can act. 

He can act. He is one of the best actors I have ever seen. 

Is that right? 

He is. He's an astonishing -- I mean I met him in a play, he's really incredible. But the other thing about the theater is that you're the arbiter of taste. When you're on stage, you are the one determining what's working. 

Right. 

And in TV and film you're waiting for someone else to tell you when they got it. 

The audience tells you or who tells you? 

Well, yes, the audience tells you, the other actors, but in TV and film, the director tells you when they got it, when they're done and I feel it would be really easy to lose touch with that arbiter, with knowing your own taste level. And I also just love telling a story from beginning to end. That's what stories are. 

When you have done what you have done, do you stop -- how do you grow? Do you stop taking lessons? Do you stop -- is it just simply learning by doing and being involved in the process. 

I think so. I think for any young actor you're never going to learn to act in the classroom. I think you have to be on the stage, for example. I think the stage is a wonderful training ground for TV and film because you learn how to repeat a performance. And I think a lot of times, young actors think of TV and film as that quick one-off take that you get. And it's true, you only have to do it well one time, really. But they, they neglect the fact that you might have to have a catharsis on screen and you have to do it 12 times which is very unnatural. Your body has had an experience, then you have to stuff it back in and do it again. And I think you learn how to do that in the theater. 

Sometimes actresses or actors can read a book and see a part and say to themselves, oh my god, I would love to be that person. 

Yes. 

That role just speaks to me. Did that happen here? 

Most definitely. I had read Tom Perrotta's book years before it was made into a television series. And I remember having an affinity for Nora Durst in the book, even though she was kind of a small part in the book, and so when it came time to audition, you know, when I want in to tape with Ellen Lewis, I thought, oh, nobody else can do this but me. And luckily, this time they agreed. They don't always. But this time it worked out. 

And how does she deal with grief in the way that we suggested was a central part of this? 

She's -- well, what I love about Damon Lindelof's writing is that anyone who has experienced grief in real life knows it's not linear. You don't go through the steps neatly in one after another. You regress and you go two steps forward and one step back. And I think what's lovely about the show is that it feels truthful in that exploration and that we see characters back slide into emotional territory they seemed to have already covered. And as an actor, it's nice because whenever you are repeating an emotion you want to have a reason for doing that. You don't want to just reach into your bag of tricks and be crying again, you want to have circumstances that support why the character is back in this place and it is usually unfinished business. And I think Damon does that really beautifully. 

Who is her boyfriend in this case? 

Oh, Kevin Garvey. He's the sheriff of the town. In the book, he's the mayor. A doughier mayor than our very attractive Justin Theroux. 

Yes. 

And I think they meet each other in really honest places. That's how they start this relationship. They're just very honest with each other from the jump and our characters get in to trouble whenever they migrate away from that. Whenever they start pretending, their relationship goes off the rails a little bit, but Justin is wonderful. 

Here's you with him. 

Oh, great. 

Hey. 

Hey, what are you doing home? 

I just came home to change shirts. 

OK. 

Sick of me already? 

I have to go to St. Louis for work, just a couple of nights. 

I'm going to miss you. 

I'll miss you too. Do you mind if I borrow this? I need something to read on the plane. 

Really? 

You don't want me to take it? 

No. No, Matt said there's only one copy. 

Maybe Matt should have gone to Kinkos. 

Are you busting my balls? 

Can holy balls be busted? 

I would love for to you take it. 

We're on the same page about this, right? This is ridiculous. 

Yes, it's really ridiculous. 

And she did kiss the lips of Kevin... and lo, it was good. (LAUGHTER) 

Looks like a good relationship to me. 

Yeah, we've really had great chemistry from the beginning, me and Justin. And I love the characters. Again, they kind of start their relationship in honesty and they call each other on their, you know, tricks, and I think that's healthy. 

How is second season different from first season? 

Well, second season had -- we started in a very hopeful place, creating a family. We've sort of moved past the content of the book, which is mostly centered on the grief and this town dealing with it. And now season three where we find ourselves, there is quite a bit of momentum. I think the show was very character driven in the first two seasons. And season three is very plot driven, I think. As we know these people and they're moving forward very quickly and we only had eight episodes to finish the series, so it must move quickly, I think. 

And then there's "Fargo." 

Yes, and then there's "Fargo." 

And who is Gloria? 

Gloria is a very practical, very Midwestern woman. These are my people. I'm from the Midwest too, so we don't suffer fools and we're quite, again, practical and she is, you know, she's got a lot of perspicacity, she sees the truth. 

There's a word I haven't heard in a while. Good for you. 

Good, thanks. You know, I like to read books. She is, yes, she's very clear thinking and no one listens to her because -- partly because she's a woman, I think, and she's in a very male dominated profession. She's also -- we meet her at a very low point in her life where her -- she may be losing her job, her little precinct is being absorbed by the county. She is getting a divorce, her husband left her for a man. 

Her husband left her for a man. 

Yes, he has. Quite a shock for Gloria. And you know, she's raising a 12-year-old boy basically on her own. And then there is a murder and then she is responsible for that, too. So she is kind of the least Minnesota nice cop we have in "Fargo" because she just doesn't have the patience for it right now. 

Other than Midwest, what else does it share with "The Leftovers?" 

Oh, I think apparently I'm very enigmatic, I'm told. 

Gloria is enigmatic. 

You can't tell what I'm thinking. Well, I guess she keeps her cards close. She doesn't ask for help very easily. And I think, you know, I also think she's got a very rye sense of humor, which I think Nora also shares with her from "The Leftovers." 

She was demoted from being police chief. 

Yes, she was. You know, they have a little police station that's the library and the police station and one other cop working with her. And the county kind of rolls in and says this is inappropriate. We need to get you guys into ship shape. And so we have this great, you know, East Coast sheriff played by Shay Wigham who kind of busts in and takes over. Very disconcerting. 

How large is the town? Very tiny. 

Oh, gosh, tiny, tiny town. Very tiny town. We actually shot it in Beiseker, which is a very little town up in Canada where we're working. 

The town is what, Eden, Minnesota. 

Eden Prairie, yes. 

Eden Prairie, Minnesota. 

Eden Prairie, and Eden Valley both towns sort of feature prominently in the story. There is some confusion. 

Talk about "Gone Girl." That show taught you what? 

Oh, gosh. You know, I remember when we first -- I had my first scene. We've done some exteriors getting in and out of cars, that sort of thing and I finally had some scene work. 

Getting in and out of cars. 

Yes, exactly. That's what American film is all about. In and out of doors and cars, but he said -- he said I need you to look up in this particular way because I'm not getting enough screen direction and I didn't know what screen direction was. 

I don't either, what is it? 

Well, it's about the angle of -- I still don't really know. It's about the angle of where you're looking in the other person's perspective and to camera and I didn't know what he was asking for. And so he had a very prescriptive way -- I was suppose to pick up this magazine and look up at the same time and use my chin and I was utterly confused. And he said -- 

But he can tell that you in one second and you can follow that direction? 

Well, it was interesting because had I known what he was asking I think I could have done it but he said, you can't do it. And so the next day I said, you know, I don't understand the vocabulary. You need to tell me the vocabulary and then I can do it. And from that moment on, he became a great teacher. And he would say come, look at the monitor, see what I'm doing here? This is why I need to you glide out in the right foot. 

So this is great a opportunity, isn't it? 

It was astonishing and he's such a perfectionist and so am I. And so as long as you're not a crazy person, you're going to get along great with him because he just wants to make the best thing he can and so do I. 

If you're a perfectionist, are you ever satisfied with your role? 

Never. 

Never. 

Never. You'll never be satisfied. You only see your mistakes. 

Well, then do you watch them? 

I do. I think it's important to watch. I think you learn a lot about being on camera, for example, from watching yourself. You have to get past the vanity. 

Yes. 

And then you can really watch the acting and learn some things about your habits, you know. 

So what do you learn? I mean, when you see yourself. 

You know, one thing I learned, for example, my first season playing Nora or watching "Gone Girl" is how much work I was doing to make sound. So, how hard my mouth was working to make words. And so the next time I went back on stage, I had a woman, this wonderful woman, Gigi, come in and work with me on how to have more ease in my speaking so that I could be simpler on camera. I think that is an example of what you learn. 

Here is Gloria having dinner with her two sons and her daughter, her stepfather. 

Something special for the clean plate club. 

I told you I don't like strawberries. 

More for me then. So the thinking is, absorb the local precinct into the larger county force. 

Leaving you jack (expletive). 

Language. No, no, I'd still be the highest ranking, you know, local officer, just not -- 

Chief. 

Right. What did you get there? 

A model grandpa made me. 

Like I said, just a stupid carving remembering the time we went camping. 

Don't forget, you're at your dad's this weekend. He and Dale are going to take you to the symphony. 

So, is Dale my other dad now? 

Well, no, I mean, he and your dad haven't been together that long, but if they got married -- 

It's not legal, is it, two men? 

If they did, well, you know how Ed here is my stepfather, married my mom after grandpa passed. I guess Dale would become your stepfather. I think. I honestly don't know how it works. 

I know how it works in the Bible. 

Another beer, pops? 

Now you're speaking English. 

We don't get to reveal much to you, do we? 

No, no, no. Chicago training, Steppenwolf is as good as it can get for a young actor? 

I think so. I think Chicago is as good as it can get. 

I do too, I was just going to say that. 

Yes. Have you seen much there? 

Second City is there. 

Yes. We have great comedy scenes certainly, but what I think is most dominant in Chicago is, you know, the Steppenwolf was an ensemble and all these young companies are emulating that model and what it's about is telling a story and listening. It is not about an aria. It's not about one person standing out from the group. And I think Chicago actors carry that mentality with them when they go forward and so, we're good listeners and we try to be part of the ensemble. And I think that helps any story. 

A lot of television is full of Chicago people too. 

Yes, it is, yes. 

Stephen Colbert and so many people who came through Chicago. 

Oh, yes, absolutely, most definitely. A lot of people out of that Steppenwolf ensemble and Allison Tolman who is in season one of "Fargo" was a great, you know, she was a Chicago-based comedian. And I just think there's a work ethic about the Midwest. I think we learn that hard work actually pays off and a city like Chicago, it really does. The more time you put in there -- 

The city with broad shoulders? 

The windy city too, our politics, not our weather. 

Yes. 

But I love it there. You know, Tracy just opened a play there this past weekend at the Steppenwolf so we keep returning. We live there still and we'll always be a part of that theater community. It's much more forgiving for women to be in the theater anyway. 

Sergio Garcia was here last night. If you're not a golf fan -- 

I don't watch a lot of golf, I confess. 

He just won the Masters, which is a big deal. 

Yes,
