More on Paul McCartney later, but first, Mayor Dinkins has chosen today as Circle of Recovery Day to highlight the extraordinary Bill Moyers program they had earlier tonight on Channel 13. That show explored the experiences of recovering alcoholics in one support group in California. Joining us now are representatives of four New York recovery groups, to discuss options for overcoming alcoholism. Volunteers are standing by to take telephone calls from those wanting more information on these groups, and to make treatment referrals for those who need help with alcohol or drug problems. The number to call is 1-800-468-9913. Once more, that's 1-800-468-9913. We will not take phone calls on the air tonight. I want to now introduce to you some people who come here, and they will explain their respective programs that they are involved with. First, there is Rosemary Rochester, she's a therapist, and she'll talk about - although she's not a member of AA. Also, there is Michler Bishop. Dr. ishop will talk about rational recovery system. Anne Bowe is here, talking about Women for Sobriety. And James Waldron, from Brooklyn Men in Unity. Thank you all. It's a pleasure to have you here. Let me start with you. You're a therapist. 

That's right. 

Tell me about AA. We've seen and read so much about 12-step programs, and clearly AA has been the forerunner of these programs. A lot of discussion recently about sort of the spiritual element of AA versus some other kinds of programs. Speak to us, and tell us about what AA does, and why it's been successful over the years? 

Well, Charlie, a lot of people in the scientific community are wondering just that, and currently, there are a number of federally-sponsored people who are doing research projects, perhaps trying to bottle spirituality, and who knows? At least find some scientific ways of talking about things like reconciliation, things like forgiveness. I think it's one of the most effective forms of treatment for alcoholism that I know of. 

What is it that's most effective? 

Well, there are many things. Its wonderful availability is one thing. You know, in Manhattan alone, there are over 1,000 meetings a week. So it's readily available. And therapists just aren't that available. It also offers a model of mutual support and identification. 

Is that at the core of it? Mutual support and identification? 

And acceptance, and tolerance. Is that at the core of it? I don't know. It's a very complex and rich program, and as individual, and as complex as the people who suffer from alcoholism are. So it's very hard to pinpoint, no, this is it, or that is it. I think the overall feeling, as some of my clients have described to me, is that it's like an ideal family. It offers hope, it offers optimism. It shows you how to go through things without alcohol. It offers coping strategies. It's a wonderful source of identification. I mean, you walk into one of these rooms, and I wanted to let the viewers know that there are open meetings for professionals, or just people who are interested, family of people who are struggling with addiction. 

You mean anybody can come? 

Anybody can come to an open meeting, not to a closed meeting. But you walk in, and there is somebody, truly baring their soul. I mean, telling the truth about their story. You've had Joseph Campbell on a while ago, talking about the power of story. And it's more than owning your own case history. It's a real, sort of mythical kind of thing. Where you - they go into a descent, and then there's a struggle, and then there's the homecoming. It's quite beautiful. And if you've been struggling with addiction and feel like a bad person, and nobody else has ever been in this place, there's a lot of isolation in addicted people. 

Let me move on, and I'll come back to it. And we'll talk more. Dr. Bishop, Rational Recovery? 

Well, it's different from AA. It's not a spiritual program. The underlying premise is that people are largely responsible for their behavior, and that they - if they have a problem with alcohol or drugs, they can overcome that problem by using their ability to reason and to think. It's not a spiritual program, but it's not anti-religious. Some people think it is. 

Did it originate because there was a need, or at least a demand for a program that did not have the spiritual element of AA? 

Yes, I think it originated in that way, but I think that the majority of people in 

They just did - 

They believe in God, but they don't think God's going to come down and solve this particular problem, that they have to do that themselves. And they're not comfortable with some of the steps in AA. I don't know whether you remember or know them, but many people who are not - have never had any contact with AA or NA really realize the extent to which some of these steps are religious. The third one says something about, we made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we see him. Now, some people aren't comfortable with that philosophically, so they want an alternative. And I think what upsets me is that in the city of New York, if you, for example, have a problem with alcoholism, and you wanted to check yourself into a hospital, as far as I know, there's not a city hospital or a private hospital that has an alternative to the 12-step program. You would get the 12-step program. The same is true for outpatient programs. 

And when you say the 12-step program, is that by definition AA? 

It's by definition modeled after AA. It might be NA. 

But with the spiritual element? 

That's correct. 

And just to respond to that, we'll come over here for a second to Anne Bowe and talk about Women for Sobriety. 

My understanding is that it's not - religion is something that's outside of yourself, I think. And spirituality is something that is inside, a kind of creative energy. The God as we understand him or her can be a good orderly direction. It can be the group. It can be a jar of jelly beans. As long as - 

But some people aren't connected - 

You give up the notion that you can't do it by yourself with your own power, because if you could - 

Well, you see, that's the difference. 

You wouldn't be reaching out for help. 

That's the difference, because some people aren't comfortable with the notion that, oh, well, we'll substitute the jelly bean jar. If you were a vegetarian, you wouldn't like to go to Burger King, just because they have a salad bar. You would choose to go to a restaurant that has a philosophy that is similar to your own philosophy. 

Well, the philosophy of 

But the 12 steps, many of them are very religious. Now, as I said. 

I think you've confused religion with spirituality. 

Well the sixth step says something like, we - how does it go? We agreed that we would let God take away the defects in our character. Now, many people, even religious people, would find that kind of a strong statement, which they couldn't agree with. 

Okay. We'll come back to this conflict, this discussion, because it's at the heart of the discussion about 

Women for Sobriety. Yes. I'm a member of Women for Sobriety, and we are different from AA, and Rational thinking a little. First of all, it's a women's group only, and that's really what attracted me to it. It is a very small group. The groups, if they get any larger than 8 or 10, they are broken up into smaller groups. Those are the two main things. Also, the spirituality end of it. When, as I say, women drink and recover, I feel, differently than men do. I think that's a big issue, and I think that a program that's designed by a man didn't work for me. It works for a lot of people, and a lot of people I know, it works for. It wasn't going to work for me, if I had to turn my life over, which I had been turning over to men my whole life. I was, please, take me. Anything you want me to do, I will do. And that wasn't about to work. That might work for me now, after 10 years of sobriety, but when I was newly sober and fragile, I was not - I mean, that was something, I would have just turned myself over to something else, and been addicted to that. So really, it was almost like a miracle that I was turned to Women for Sobriety, because I'm the only one that I know of that was directed to Women for Sobriety from a hotline in Nassau County. I thought I was crazy. 

You called a hotline? 

I called a hotline. 

Help us understand the situation. 

I thought I was crazy. I said, well, I must be crazy, just for the crazy things you do when you're an alcoholic. And I decided that I was crazy. I'd rather be crazy than an alcoholic, mind you. And the woman told me, I don't think you're crazy. I think that you have a problem with alcohol, and sent me to this meeting, which I had never heard of, Women for Sobriety. It's about 17, 18 years old. I have been a member for 10 years. And it works for me, and it's a positive kind of thing. We don't go, we don't tell, like in AA, we don't tell past stories. We don't rehash. Women don't need that. We're constantly - society constantly puts us down in a way, and the past just makes you feel - the terrible things you did. The difference I always like to tell is that if a woman wakes up in bed with two men, she's a tramp and a whore. If a man wakes up with two women, he scored, he's like - pats him on the back. And even as an alcoholic woman that's sober 10 years, I can still feel that a little. Yeah, that sense that society feels that way about women. And the women's part of it, the smallness, really really worked for me, in Women for Sobriety. I can't thank Jean Kirkpatrick, who founded it, enough for getting me on the right road. 

Did you not take a drink after you went to that first meeting? 

I've never taken a drink since then. 

Since that first meeting? 

August 1, yes. 

And what happened in that meeting? 

I was accepted, as I'm sure, in all of these groups, I was accepted with open arms. I didn't even - I wasn't forced to tell everybody I was an alcoholic. It took me about two years. I could go to these meetings and pretend to myself, perhaps, that I was going to go back drinking, but I had a drinking problem. And after two years, with gentle going to these meetings, I didn't miss a meeting, I can comfortably say I'm an alcoholic now, but at the beginning, I wasn't about to - that would be too harsh. 

Do you still go to meetings? 

I run a meeting now. 

And is that required? 

No, no. Some women I know don't even - it's almost encouraged by Women for Sobriety, sometimes, to get out, and not be addicted to a meeting, but I've found that giving back helps me. 

We'll come back to more. Now, let me talk about James Waldron and Brooklyn Men in Unity. 

Yes. 

What is it? 

Okay, Brooklyn Men in Unity is, it's a group of men who sought a need to bring together men in a forum that would be conducive to any type of ongoing recovery. We see a lot of men from outside enterprises, such as 12-step programs, or just men that just would walk into one of our meetings seeking help. 

They need help because of alcoholism, because of drug addiction, psychological problems? Because of anything? 

Because of alcoholism. You name it. 

And what are they seeking in the end there? Are they, in the end, seeking what? Somebody to talk to? Somebody that will listen to them? Somebody to lean on. 

Someone that they can identify with, more or less. Someone they can talk to. Someone that they can feel safe with. 

And how is what you do there different, you think, than Women for Sobriety, or AA, or the recovery program? 

It's basically the same. The only difference is our concept is spiritual and motivational ideas. We don't denounce or promote anything. We're just a group of men who see a need for any kind of ongoing growth. Understanding yourself. Getting involved with oneself. Being able to express a lot of the things that were normally taboo for men to do. 

Like what? 

Crying. Emotional stability. We get a lot of that from each other. The other thing is, we have topics of discussion that men do not normally talk about, you know. 

Like what? 

Such as, what is the role of a man? What do men think about and not speak about? Broken relationships. I heard someone speak about relationships. Broken relationships versus fear of reconciliation. 

And what if a woman wanted to come to these meetings? 

Well, these meetings are basically for men, okay. 

Yeah. 

We don't encourage women to come, because men seem to get off-centered, off-track. 

Is there, just to talk about, from all of you. What, is there something that is central to all of these programs? Again, I mentioned this earlier. There are differences having to do with spirituality, however you define it. There are other differences that you laid out with respect to why some programs have arisen after a long history with AA. Your program has been on for what, 20 years, you said? 

18. 

18 years. And how long has Brooklyn Men in Unity been? 

Brooklyn Men in Unity have been in existence for a year and a half. 

If someone would try to look and find out what is happening here, especially with new programs, Dr. Bishop, would they find, do you think? What's the common bond? 

I think the common bond, and AA is an excellent program. I didn't want to indicate any otherwise. I still recommend people to go to AA. But I think all of the programs, people get together, and they work on themselves. They work on their thinking. They work on understanding their feelings, and they share, among themselves, so that they better, as you said, they come to accept themselves as they are. And then they use various paths. Perhaps with some help from God, perhaps not. Perhaps with only a group of their own sex. And perhaps not. 

Why have these programs become popular? Certainly more so recently. They seem to be - when New York Magazine does a cover story on programs like this, it says something about some editor's decision, that they're popular. 

Well, I think that recently, people have started to question the idea that the 12-step program is the best way to go. Right now, it is pretty much, with some small exceptions, it's the only way to go. And I think people are questioning that, and saying, wait a minute. There probably are alternatives, which would be good for this group of people. And that AA is great for this group of people. 

As I mentioned, today, Mayor Dinkins has called today Circle of Recovery Day here in New York. I had mentioned, once more, the number, 1-800-468-9913, and there are volunteers that will still take your calls, and give you some direction, and some more information about programs. I thank all of you for helping us understand what is going on, and to cap off Bill Moyers' extraordinary program on the Circle of Recovery.
