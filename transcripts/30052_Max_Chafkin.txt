Good evening. I'm Gillian Tett of "The Financial Times" filling in for Charlie Rose. It's been a busy week in the tech industry. Shares of Snap Inc. opened at $24 Thursday morning, pricing its initial public offering above the marketed range. The company behind the disappearing photo app went public at a valuation twice as expensive as Facebook in 2012. Meanwhile Uber, another darling of the tech sector, has suffered from a string of recent scandals, the latest involving a video of CEO Travis Kalanick berating a driver. Now we've been here before. A decade ago, Wall Street was riding high and producing dazzling booms and dirty scandal equal measure. So how do we make sense of what's going on in the tech world? Is there a tech bubble about to burst? Joining me now is Max Chafkin who is a writer for "Bloomberg Business Week" who has been covering Uber. Richard Edelman is the president &amp; CEO of Edelman, a leading global communications firm; and William Cohan, a special contributor to "Vanity Fair" and author of, Why Wall Street Matters. I'm very pleased to have them all at this table. Welcome. Now Max, I'd like to start with you. One of the things that put Uber in the spotlight is that we've had this extraordinary video released of Travis in a cab arguing with an Uber driver. And this comes on top of this big scandal created when one of Uber's own female employees wrote a blog saying that frankly it's a very sexist place to work. I mean, this really is a combination of a P.R. nightmare for the company. Tell us a bit about this video. 

I mean it's been an extraordinary month for Uber. You didn't mention the delete Uber campaign that started in January. There is a lawsuit with Google. This video came to us, our beat reporter Eric Newcomer, it was passed to him by a driver and it's clearly a dash cam video of Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber basically getting into a very spirited debate with a driver. And I think it kind of reminds me of the Joe the plumber video if you remember that, where you have a lot of Uber drivers who have long felt that the company doesn't always have their best interests in mind and you have a driver suddenly voicing those concerns and kind of being treated in a somewhat dismissive way. 

I think one of the things why the story is fascinating is that Uber, Lyft, all these ride sharing apps is something which is embedded in almost all our lives these days. I mean, I couldn't survive without these kinds of apps. And yet as you say, there is so much controversy about the way that company is actually being run. What do you think this shows about the actual company culture, and in particular about the personality of Travis? 

I argue that it's all kind of tied up. I mean, one thing about Uber, one reason they've been very successful is that they've been able to overcome opposition from basically taxi industry lobbyists and unions. You know, in a lot of cities, the taxi industry private cars are heavily regulated and they've adopted this very aggressive approach. And they've been really, really almost unbelievably focused on growth at all costs. So I think when you look at the sexual harassment thing, you have a company that -- and I don't know exactly what's going on inside of the company, but I think when you talk to people there, you have a company that is singularly focused on growth to the point where they didn't really -- I don't think they really cared about anything other than hiring a lot of people very quickly. And that the whole function of HR at a place like Uber is hiring. It isn't making sure that bosses are behaving appropriately. It isn't policing these kinds of things and I think, you know, unfortunately that comes from the top and some of that is on the CEO and the senior managers and also on the board of directors. 

I mean you have a situation where you have dash of growth where you have this crazy hubris and you've just seen coming out from the Snap IPO. You have a lot of money swirling around. You have people are so busy doing their job they kind of get disconnected from the real world. It kind of sounds a bit familiar to me. I mean Bill, you've spent the last few years looking at crazy behavior and hubris on Wall Street. What do you make of this? 

Gillian, this is a classic narrative arc to me. One thing we like to do, the business press loves to do is sort of find these darlings, like Travis or like Mr. Snapchat, Mr. Snap Inc. and you know, sort of build them up, make them seem almost mythological. Make them seem larger-than-life. And we like to build them up, build them up. I mean, I think part of the reason that the Uber story has gone as viral as you said is because it has, what, a $70 billion valuation. It's a private company. It doesn't -- you know, I would argue and we sort of had this discussion when "Vanity Fair" last year when we were talking about, you know, the new establishment list and everyone was saying how great Travis is, we got to put him at number one. I'm thinking, hold on, guys. This is a taxi company. We're valuing a taxi company at $70 billion. 

A taxi company that we all use though. 

But even if we all use it, it's still just a taxi company. Now, everyone says, oh, no, it's so much more than a taxi company. You don't understand, it's the way we're going to have everything delivered, everything -- our whole lives is going to be the Jetsons. Well, I think we've priced for the Jetsons and I think that once you begin to say, OK, Travis is just like a regular guy. He puts his pants on one leg at a time. It's kind of just like a taxi company, and there he is in the back of a taxi abusing a driver and then, I mean, the sexual harassment blog was stunning. As soon as I read it I knew. 

-- was by Susan Fowler, one of the former Uber employees who was a software engineer who talks about this stuff in extraordinary detail about how she was -- there were three percent of employees that were women and they were subject to extraordinary treatment. 

And HR did nothing. She would report it to HR and HR did nothing. 

But this sounds so reminiscent, don't you think, of the banking sector a decade ago? I will ask Richard about this in a moment but you know -- 

I mean, it is -- this kind of -- 

Is tech the new banking sector? 

Well, I mean, I think there is -- it certainly has become a darling like the banking sector was. I mean, in terms of people coming out of MBA's or graduate schools or whatever, wanting to go in the tech sector. They don't want to work in investment banking anymore. They want to go -- even reporters don't want to cover investment banking anymore. They want to cover the tech sector. 

OK, so Max, you are doing the hot beat right now. Congratulations. Richard, your job is to go around firefighting and to deal with companies that have messed up spectacularly. You don't represent Uber. First of all, if you were advising Travis right now, what on earth would you recommend that he does because he came out with this extraordinary statement, which to my mind, was in some ways perhaps encouraging. He said essentially that he needed leadership lessons. He said that he needed to grow up, like the rest of the tech sector. Do you think that's the right approach for a CEO to take right now? 

I think he was really smart in trying to staunch the bleeding and apologize wholeheartedly and without reservation. And I think it was -- he was very clear that he had messed up and that he had a lot of work to do. But I think there is much more to play out here. I think Max was correct that the sexual harassment kind of initiative that Arianna Huffington and the former attorney general of the United States, Holder, are leading is deeply important for the company to get done. And there was a special investigation by these two outsiders brought in to basically fix the culture. And so she is actually helping to lead it, with Holder as an outside counsel. And I think it will be a fundamental look at, you know, do we have a problem? If so, what are we going to do about it? And then further, I think Travis has to establish himself as a person who accepts that he's running a big company and that he's not just an entrepreneur anymore. And this arc has actually been followed by many and in a successful way. I mean, I look at a person who actually started, you know, Steve Jobs, you know, there are others who've matured over a period of time in the CEO job and I think made significant strides. And I think you know, hopefully Travis can do that. 

What I'm curious about is, now you have a survey that comes out once a year which looks at the level of trust amongst people in 18 different countries, in different business sectors, and I remember the reason I first noticed that was because I used to write about the banking sector. And unsurprisingly, trust in banking completely collapsed after the financial crisis. Now, what was amazing to my mind is that trust amongst consumers in the technology sector has stayed sky high. These guys have been like gods. Do you think that's dangerous? Do you think we're going to see a cracking of that sky-high trust as a result of some of these scandals? 

So the tech industry has really benefited from cell phones and other sorts of products that people use every day that continue to somehow be affordable and the sense that somehow they're good employers. Now, the idea somehow that they're not good employers gets around, that's really corrosive. The idea somehow that CEOs are entitled, really problematic. In fact, you'll remember that from the data, the huge drop in trust in CEOs this year cross every one of the 28 countries we did the work in. And you know, CEOs are down there with government officials. Really a great place to be. 

I think journalists were even lower, I must say. 

But in fact, the opportunity for technology is substantial. You have people like Benioff who are interested in health care or sustainable cities. I think that the arc is different to technology. I just wanted to disagree with Bill slightly because I think that there's a record -- Pierre Omidyar who is at eBay, have actually made substantial kind of philanthropic, and Bill Gates also, and have been activists in the foundation world. 

OK, so they can try and buy their way into a halo. But I'm kind of curious, Bill. I mean having seen Wall Street go from god to devil, becoming everyone's favorite pinata if you're a politician, do you think that there's a chance of that happening with tech? And if you were running your own massive P.R. company, what would you be advising all those tech companies to do? 

I think there is a chance that it happens with tech and it's because of this arc of the narrative, if you let me go back to that a little bit, because I think regardless of the industry, I think we like to build up these titans of industry and then, you know, when they stumble, we like to kind of tear them down and bring them down. And you know, once it's not a great place to work anymore -- everybody is flocking to tech because they perceive it to be like it's a Googleplex, you know, free food all day long. You can take your skateboard with your computer and go to your little nook and if you want to take a nap, you can take a nap. I mean, it just seems, you know, fabulous. And I think a lot of people on Wall Street who were forced to work really long hours -- and I've written stories about people on Wall Street who've, you know, committed suicide because of the long hours and how horrible that is. And so Wall Street, between the financial crisis and the long hours, has gotten a very bad reputation, which they haven't been able to dig themselves out of. If that arc begins to change for tech, then I think you're going to see, you know, it's interesting -- MBA's, graduates of our leading universities, they vote with their feet very quickly and they're like traders in that regard. They will go into a hot industry when it's sexy and exciting. But once they see a crack or it's not giving them the kind of image that they want for themselves, they immediately go to something else. 

I mean Max I'm really curious because you covered the tech sector, not just Uber and you know, all of this is happening as we have these IPO's with these crazy valuations. I mean, it sounds a bit like 2000 all over again. And the amazing thing about the Snap IPO today is that we've come out with this prize, it's risen 50 percent on the first day, and Snap actually, its business right now is actually not growing that fast. It's threatened by other rivals and it's not even giving its shareholders any voice, you know. 

So I think it's important when we're talking, comparing tech today to tech in 2000, or to banking, to look at like what is -- are these companies creating value for consumers? And I think that's one thing that's maybe getting lost here just a little bit, is that people -- well, you brought it up -- people really like Uber. Their numbers are increasing every week. And I think, you know, branding problems aside, like, a business like that has value. And I think Snapchat, yes, we can sort of make fun of it, it's sort of silly. But the thing is that teenagers and people in their '20s are spending enormous amounts of time with this app. And yes, it's an app that we as sort of older folks maybe don't totally understand, but it's getting a lot of attention at a time when mainstream media companies are really struggling. I mean when you look at sort of what ESPN is going through, what some of the news networks are going through, you know, they're really struggling to find younger users. And younger users, not just who are going to click on a link like at Facebook, but sit in front of it for, you know, minutes and hours at a time. And I think that's when people are, you know, paying sky-high valuations for Snapchat stock, that's what they're banking on. They think that this is television and Snapchat owns television. 

Well that's a great point. I must say, as a parent of tweens and teenagers, I do not feel like Snapchat adds much value to the world or global civilization, period, but hey, one day you'll you have teenies and tweenies too, but you make a good point because you know, clearly these businesses are thriving right now. But if we come back to Uber again, one of the things that's really interesting about the video that caused this whole scandal, whereas today's scandal, yesterday's scandal, is the conversation that Travis actually had with the driver because he says we're not dropping the price on black, as one of the services, then the taxi driver says yes. And he goes on and says, we have competitors, if we didn't drop the prices we'd be out of business. And to my mind in some ways that's a really interesting wrinkle because it suggests that maybe this Uber miracle actually isn't that miraculous after all. Maybe it is more fragile than we realized. 

I think he's right. It's more fragile. I think he realizes that it's fragile and I think a lot of people who see the sky-high valuations don't quite understand that it's very easy for consumers to move say from Uber to Lyft or one of these other startups that are basically trying to build companies on top of Uber's driver network. And the thing that's even maybe a little scarier, if you're sitting where Travis Kalanick is sitting, it's very easy for drivers to move. If you get into an Uber today, you'll notice often that they have maybe two or even three Smartphones for different apps. And because Uber's model is really attractive to investors because these drivers are not employees, they're contractors. They can't -- Uber can't tell them when to work or when not to work. But that is a double-edged sword because they can leave at any time. They can two-time or three-time Uber as much as they want and because so many investors have poured money into Uber's competitors, you know, those companies are able to subsidize payments to drivers. So Uber is kind of in a box even though it has this enormous valuation. 

Drivers will also -- I have found Uber drivers will bad mouth Uber and actually tell you that you should -- you're better off if you just use Gett or Lyft, and if you know which -- 

You've actually had people say don't use Uber. 

An Uber driver that I was in with my wife said do not use -- this is not the right service, you should use Gett or Lyft. I mean, to your point there, I think these companies, Snap, Snap Inc., Uber, yes, they're like networks. They're like TV networks. They have a lot of eyeballs now. They have a lot of people engaging with them. And I think there is a lot of value to that, but I don't understand the valuations. So, $70 billion for Uber. To me it is just a taxi company. Snap Inc., OK, it was priced as you said, the high end of the range and traded up 50 percent. It's got a loss of $550 million. I mean that sounds sort of Amazonesque. Even Amazon now is actually making money for the first time and maybe it will grow into its paws as we like to say, or something. You know, maybe they'll be like Facebook and just be a rocket ship to the moon, but I do not understand these valuations. As someone who was a banker on Wall Street during the last internet bubble, I never understood them then. And you know, and is Warren Buffett investing in these companies? He didn't invest then and he was right. He is not investing now, although he invested in Apple and has made a ton, but Apple is an extremely profitable company and does not have anywhere near these kinds of valuations. 

I think the key difference between Wall Street and the tech sector is that the tech sector has absolutely got to retain its employee base. They are the key to the success. They are not so movable as the talent in Wall Street. They've got to have programmers and that is the essence of their success strategy. And so, if you think forward about whether it's Uber or any other, you've got to absolutely put employees at the center of your communication strategy and so go from inside out, and rebuild this trust because in fact, now you see some degree of crack in the edifice and whether it's pay, whether it's benefits, whether it's a reconsideration of workplace safety for women, all of these have to be part of the recommendation for Travis. 

Well, let's turn this around a bit because one of the interesting angles of this whole thing is this question of sexual harassment and a climate for women in Silicon Valley right now. By the way, I think it's fabulous that we have three male guests talking about this because I happen to think that too much of the time is women talking about women's issues and it needs to be a joint conversation. But if you believe, Richard, that actually companies are going to have to work hard to actually hang on to their employees, one of the most interesting things right now is that we are about half a million people short of STEM employees, computer employees in America right now. And at the same time there are only about 18 percent women on computer science courses in America. So one question, is there any way to make these cultures in Silicon Valley less macho, less male? I mean, people talk about, you know, the brogrammers culture, how do you get women into Silicon Valley? 

You don't do it if, you, with Susan, right. 

Susan Fowler, the employee of Uber who came out who said -- 

Who was an engineer and wanted to be -- and was happy to be an engineer and was assigned to a group at Uber that she was happy about. And then basically was mistreated miserably. I mean so, you know, unfortunately Wall Street does that same thing or has a history of doing that same thing. You know, I remember -- 

They come out with PR gloss and say, we love women and then actually don't do anything about it. 

I mean women are actually on Wall Street. It's an infinitesimally small number. 

Is it better or worse than Silicon Valley do you think? 

I think it's probably better in Silicon Valley, but, because, you know, it just seems like culturally it's more forgiving. You know, you can have more flexible hours. You can work from home. You can do those things that are more helpful to women if they choose to be that way. On Wall Street, I remember at Lazard, you know, when they got the first woman. You know, why do we have to have a woman? And then there was one woman who was a banker and then somebody suggested another woman. And the edict came from down on high saying why do we need a second woman? We have one already. (LAUGHTER) 

Yeah, no, I've been there. What do you think, Max because, you know, you cover these companies, I mean it seems to me one of the problems is you do get some women at the top like Sheryl Sandberg. You do get people to join the company at the bottom. What happens in the middle in terms of the lack of women? 

I mean it's interesting, you know, to Bill's point, if you pull the average, you know, Silicon Valley worker aside and ask them, quiz them about their beliefs about gender and what you'll find is they are generally progressive people. They're generally people who believe in equality of pay and basically are horrified by the allegations in that blog post. But as a whole, because basically these companies are not super sophisticated in hiring, you end up with a culture that's overwhelmingly male. There are all sorts of interesting ways that Silicon Valley investors talk. But one is they talk about pattern matching where you know, try to squint at a company that you like, say like Facebook and then you look at another company like Snapchat and you see if they're similar. And that pattern matching thing is basically discrimination. And I mean that's what that is. And so that is, I think that is the cultural thing that is probably more insidious than the sort of general bro-ness of Silicon Valley. 

The only question I would have is if you got a $70 billion market cap, and you are claiming that your HR department is only in the business of hiring and not providing support to women who need help and rooting out this bad behavior that Susan wrote about. I mean, I just don't get that. 

So, I think Uber especially, but a lot of Silicon Valley companies really value basically disruption, which kind of gets thrown around a lot, but I think the bottom line is Uber is a really big company that wasn't acting like a big company. It was acting like a startup and at a startup you don't care about the possibility you're going to get sued for sexual harassment if you are thinking very hardheadedly. All you care about is surviving the next six months or the next 12 months and that is, I mean, that's insidious no matter what. But I mean it's super insidious when we're talking about a company that employs thousands of people. And they, for whatever reason because their investors didn't demand it or because of immaturity at the top, you know, weren't able to get there. 

I mean, so basically when Travis said I need to grow up, he needs to grow up, not just as a human being, a leader. His company needs to grow up and he needs to recognize he's managing a big company, and the tech sector as a whole needs to grow up, if you like. But I'm curious, Richard, I mean, you're in the business of dealing with nightmare problems. What do you do about the women in Silicon Valley? 

I think the women in Silicon Valley are part of the bigger exercise for the tech industry. This is the industry that in fact in my mind is going to be at the greatest risk from President Trump. I think it has the biggest challenge on supply chain, on immigration, on LGBT -- 

A greater risk from Trump in what way? 

Oh, because in a certain way, the workforce is deeply diverse, deeply global. The supply chains are deeply global. They do not base their business on a made in America kind of label. And they have to sell in China and sell in Mexico and make sure that their data is secure in those places for the local governments. And they're at cross-purposes with an administration that's deeply unilaterally focused on American jobs and American security and closing the bridges in a certain way. And so I think the tech industry has to lead the fight in a way for that which is America as part of the world, and America as the sort of leader in decency and the values that are global values at a time when that's not necessarily so popular. And I think all of the CEOs in Silicon Valley have to in a way work with the administration but also stay true to what they believe in so that they keep their employees because otherwise they lose that. They'll really be in trouble. 

I think that is why Travis actually showed some leadership when he came out against the immigration ban or what we call the immigration ban and stepped off the CEO Council that Trump formed, you know, with Steve Schwartzman as the leader of it. I think he actually showed -- that was like a good Travis Kalanick moment. He's had a couple of bad ones since then but absolutely the issue of, I mean, Silicon Valley is more dependent on these kind of not only the brain power but the diversity of a workforce more than probably any other sector in the country. And so that's why they are up in arms against this so-called immigration ban. 

And of course if the immigration ban is imposed, skills shortage is going to get even bigger, which again, comes back to, if I'm going to tie it together, to the question of whether you can get more women into CS, more women into computer science, more women involved. But Max, I'm curious, I mean do you agree with Richard that the tech sector is potentially vulnerable to not just a consumer backlash or a liberal backlash of women issue, but also a political backlash from President Trump? 

I think they're boxed in, in a big way. Because you know, on one hand, you know, Trump is basically asking CEOs to work with him in one way or the other, whether it's keeping jobs or showing up on advisory boards. And as Richard says, I mean, the vast majority of employees at Uber, at all of these companies voted for Democrats and donated to Democrats and they don't want to work for a company that is seen as not as accommodating, you know, somebody they don't like politically. I do think that the Trump -- that there are ways that Trump and tech may end up being closer than people realize right now. I don't know that tech is going to end up being this bastion of resistance. You look at a couple of very large companies that have kind of seemed to cozy up to Trump, Intel and Oracle -- somebody like Elon Musk who is a, you know, dyed in the wool pretty liberal guy. He is pro, you know, he wants to stop climate change. Is on a committee with Trump and has said some nice things about Rex Tillerson. And I think just when you look at what Trump's sort of economic nationalism, there are ways in which Silicon Valley, which is creating jobs in the U.S. in large part, appeals to that. And so I don't think it's obvious to me anyway that this is going to be some pitch battle with Trump on one side and the Valley on the other side. 

Would you agree? 

I don't. I think it's quite inevitable that there's going to be a lot of tension particularly on trade because of supply chain, particularly Mexico and China -- also on security and privacy because, you know, this administration is deeply focused. I also think that there is a terrific opportunity for tech to take the initiative in explaining retraining of employees. You know, there are going to be three million people who drive trucks for a living who are going to be having to have a different work in ten years and no one is addressing this and I really believe that the tech -- 

Basically we're going to get the driverless cars and driverless trucks. 

Yes. 

I mean it's one of the ironies of the whole Uber story actually if you like, with the taxi drivers. Actually, in ten years' time, there may not be anymore taxi drivers for Uber. 

I don't know why for example the tech industry wouldn't say look, we're going to fund specific training programs in 25 cities across this country and others that help people make this transition and make sure that they -- these drivers have the skills necessary for ten years out. That would be responsible, that is something that Travis could, for example, do for people at Uber. 

So is it time to view the tech sector, if you like -- I wouldn't say trying to buy their halos, scrub up their halo, but actually get really aggressive by trying to get more involved in the proper debate, get involved not just in philanthropy, but actually trying to find solutions to these problems? 

My view is that the classic fall for business is to be after an innovator and now that you actually have to get involved in making public policy and helping make these transitions on automation. It's got to get out of its traditional box and it's not just for halo purposes, it's also actually to make sure that they have a viable business model ten years on. 

And so they attract the best and the brightest people because -- 

Exactly. 

Because this generation, this millennial generation, my children, you know, they want to work for a business where they can have a full well-rounded life. I mean -- 

Would your children work for Uber, do you think? 

Well, one of my sons wants to be a politician, the other wants to be a writer. So, I don't know that they're going to work for Uber, but I think they want to have a balanced life. And I hear this consistently from people who think they want to work on Wall Street. And the hours are punishing and the competition is punishing. And it's really hard to have a balanced life even though Wall Street makes a big point of trying to ensure that people don't work all day every weekend, but they find that people are so competitive that they have to demand that they not come in on a Sunday or whatever. That's not really a balanced life. You need to have balance. Millennials want -- this new generation wants balance. And -- and if -- I mean, I think that's one of the great appeals that Google has had is just that sort of notion, I was talking about before, you can skateboard your way through the office while you are feasting on free food all day long. It's ironic because actually it keeps you there much longer than you otherwise would be. So it is kind of brilliant. But I mean, I think Google kind of in many ways epitomizes the company that people want, young people want to work for. 

Yes. 

And a lot of these tech companies, they enable change. For example, if health care can really be somehow addressed by having people with devices or somehow better medical records or others, this is something tech can own, and again, make change, you know, as they did with cell phones. Something that makes them important and sympathetic. 

I would like to come to another issue which is that one of the things that makes this video of Travis so compelling is that there he is in the backseat of a cab being filmed by presumably a camera on the dashboard, we don't exactly know how. 

Camera on the dashboard. 

Camera on the dashboard, okay. Somehow found its way to Bloomberg, congratulations. But getting filmed as we go about our everyday business. And it makes compelling viewing watching what somebody in an unguarded moment is actually doing. You see Travis stroking his cell phone. Makes me also wonder, if someone put a camera on the dashboard of the taxis I travel every day, what would we all see? You know, none of us are used to this 24/7 scrutiny. So I'm curious, do you think there is any chance that there is going to be a backlash against this kind of constant scrutiny? 

I mean I think -- we saw it a little bit even after publishing the video. And I think, you know. 

People complaining of the video. 

Yes, there was some discussion about whether, you know, basically where the line is. And you know, from our point of view, it was newsworthy. Uber's relationship with its drivers is at the core of the company. And they were directly speaking to that. But that said, I think one of the things that's scary about tech maybe broadly is the way that it's, you know, eroding privacy, I mean -- 

Do you know whether, is it standard practice for Uber drivers to be filming their passengers? 

It's pretty common in black cars in general to use cameras like a security measure. 

Yes, I can see both Bill and Richard looking pretty shocked right now. (LAUGHTER) Okay, how many people out there watching tonight knew that you were being constantly filmed in the back of a car? 

We are being filmed everywhere nowadays. If you are in the big city, you are in New York, you're filmed in the subway, you're filmed as you are walking down 6th avenue, you're filmed everywhere. Do you think when you go by the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, you're not being filmed, you are being filmed. And, of course, we now know that the NSA can even listen to our phones when they are not on and film us when they are not on, and people putting tape over the camera on their computer because they're afraid of getting filmed so... 

This is what I find fascinating because, you know, one way to look at this is, hey, this is so scary. We're all living in brave new world. The other way to look at it is that actually this is a major victory for democracy and the power of the people. Because at the end of the day, it was actually a taxi driver who forced Travis into this unbelievably embarrassing apology. Now, if you imagine 10, 20 years ago, taxi drivers wouldn't have had that power. If you think back to your days on Wall Street, Bill, what would have happened if you actually had cameras filming what was happening every day on the trading floor. 

Or in offices behind closed doors. It would not be pretty. But the thing that I just cannot imagine, I can't compute at the moment is, so we live in this society, I mean, whether it's been the last 10 or 15 years, we should know that we're being filmed. Everything we do is potentially discoverable, findable. I mean one of the great things, you know, police cams, you know, we've caught so many police crime on film that we never had before. We kind of knew that police were abusing sectors of the society. And now we can actually prove it and that has been devastating and is leading to change. But even knowing that everything is being filmed or everything could be filmed, it is amazing. Why would Travis act that way in the back of a cab? 

Didn't know there was a camera. You didn't know there were those cameras in the back of the cab. 

I mean, I don't act that way anyway. If you are an adult, you act in a certain way, you act with dignity, and you comport yourself with a certain decorum. He's the CEO of a $70 billion company. 

Tell me, Bill, can you say with a clean conscience that if you had been filmed nonstop in the back of a cab for the last 20 years you would be happy with everything? 

Well, I'm a subway guy, so I generally, and my wife, you know, to have us be in a cab. I think basically what people would see is us looking at our cell phones and going through our emails. 

Richard, but you know -- 

I would agree with you. I wouldn't necessarily want every black cab ride for sure. But, more important, I think the way in which people are communicating is not top down anymore. It's peer to peer. And you know, also that the most credible person today is a friend, one of your peers. 

Your surveys essentially show, the fascinating thing about the Edelman surveys is they show that actually trust these days has shifted away from people having trust in their leaders to having trust in their Facebook friends, or if you like, now their Snapchat or Instagram or Twitter friends. 

Yes. And the key difference then is frequency and authenticity, and you know, that which is novel. As opposed to experts. Your parliamentarian Mr. Gove said we're sick of experts in the U.K., you know, in regard to the Brexit. So, the fact is that that's why the employees matter more than ever. In fact, it's going to be a peer to peer conversation or customers being happy. And I think here sharing economy companies generally have done brilliantly in having platforms to allow the customers to rate the service and the drivers to rate the customer. So there is some degree of transparency that allows mutual ratings. And in a certain way, Travis' comments undermine that kind of mutual respect between service provider and employee and customer. 

Or you can say that the tremendous irony of the story is essentially, he has died by his own sword, if you like. And that he created the system that gave taxi drivers the power to rate people and to essentially have their voice heard and guess what, they use it against their own boss, if you like. 

Look, how many times do we see that happen over and over and over again? You know, you are the editor of the FT, you see this all the time and look at Gawker. I mean, talk about dying by the sword. I mean, they got hoisted on their own petard. And, you know, you may argue about whether or not it was right that, you know, Elon Musk funded the litigation -- Peter Thiel funded the litigation, but they made themselves extremely vulnerable. 

So the question I really have, and this is basically for Max and for Richard, is, is this actually a story about the power of consumers and the power of employees to overturn abuse of power? 

I think that's part of it. And I do think in the long run, Uber, this will be good for Uber. Because these conversations have been happening and I think it's telling that Uber, rather than say this is not a news story or responding in some more aggressive way, apologize, because what they realize is that this is a real thing that their drivers are really talking about. And as angry as the driver was, I imagine, I think he did them a favor by putting this out there. And I think, you know, a lot of times, this more transparent world that we live in is better for the world than it otherwise would be. 

I think the central issue for the tech industry is trust. You know, look at Facebook and Google and the issue of fake news. And to what extent were they or weren't they part of the election outcome and what's the future for Germany and France on fake news, just as an example. And I really believe deeply that the smart tech company will put this on their badge and say we are going to be trusted by our constituents by behaving in a certain way as a company that sees 10 years out and takes on the big issues of the time and really has our chief executive in leadership as opposed to just to Wall Street and making money. And I think there's a bigger expectation somehow of tech companies, that they were sort of borne of the people and they really have to represent the people. (LAUGHTER) 

I think corporate activism is kind of part of the problem here. And I think that one of the things that has made it challenging for the tech industry to deal with sexual harassment, for instance, is that they have this idea, it's like that the tech industry is more meritocratic than everybody else. That they are somehow exceptional. And I think that makes it harder for whistle-blowers to be heard. And I think this idea that tech companies are somehow good or better is, I don't know, I think it's really lovely, as somebody who writes about tech and who is an avid user of many of these companies, I also think it's maybe not totally real. And we would be better off treating them like businesses that want to make money, not businesses that are going to save the world. 

I actually say look at how diverse the leadership is. Look how many CEOs are of Indian descent or other, that is not true in other industries. Also the extent to which you can have a sort of entrepreneur-driven company that actually gets to the point of being able to be big and keep going as opposed to just being snapped up. It's different that way. 

I think it would be healthy for Silicon Valley to be taken down a peg frankly, not only in the valuations of these companies, but in our estimation that they are somehow literally changing the world, that we need to sort of bow down to them as some sort of, you know, uber gods, no pun intended. I mean, I think it's gotten a little out of control. I mean, just as it did in 1999 and 2000, and then it was literally vaporware because there were no earnings and nothing other than eyeballs. Now, they've got legitimate businesses that actually make a lot of money. They're not gods and I think we can see that with Travis and the way he has behaved and the way people in his company get treated. You know, I think we all need to be more civil, and more, take a step, unfortunately we have a leader in the White House who has not -- who sort of fomented on rest and fomented a lot of bad feelings and made it okay for people to be abusive to one anther and that's reprehensible unfortunately. I think we just need to take a deep breath here. 

Question, is the message for anyone who is sitting there in an office of any type and is feeling that they have an abusive boss, they have abusive people in charge, dealing with a company, whatever, that they don't like. Is it simply to get out your cell phone and get filming whenever you can. Is that gonna be the new check and balance in the American system? 

It's -- 

We've seen that in the police sector already but is that what we ought to be doing? 

It is very easy to say that. But it is also really scary. I mean, I have known a lot of whistle-blowers on Wall Street who had the guts to come forward and talk about abuse that they saw leading up to 2008 financial crisis. What did they get in return? They got fired in return. So if you want to put your career on the line and Richard would know about this as well as anyone, then you should take out your cell phone. And I think Susan again was trying to work within the system to try to reform the HR department at Uber. And she obviously felt like she reached a dead end. The only thing she could do was resign and then write the blog. Now, there will be some change. 

She got another job though, which is great. 

Well, that is what you are forced to do. But then -- good for her that she went public and now apparently they're gonna face hopefully this report that Holder and Arianna Huffington are doing is not just sort of an internal whitewash thing. I hope it gets released to the public. I hope it's very detailed. I hope it ruins other people's careers at Uber who are treating women this way. 

But, you know, Gillian, I think this goes well beyond the tech sector. I think that it actually has to do with corporate strategy. So United Airlines, Oscar Munoz comes in, he says, you know, we've had a very adversarial relationship with the unions here for 10 years, including the Continental merger, and I don't like this, I am going to try and change this deal because we're ranked number eight out of eight airlines in so many categories. And so I want to make a deal with unions. I want to have better service, I want to have better performance. And let's make this a win-win. And so he's raised salaries. But he's also gotten much better performance. I think United is now third in baggage, and on-times, and all this. So this actually becomes an explicit decision by the leader who says okay, I can fix this. 

And do you think that, you know, Uber is going to find a way to actually learn from this and move forward? 

I think, yes. 

Because at the moment, they are hunkering down. The reason we don't have anyone from Uber with us tonight is because they are reluctant to talk about this, perhaps understandably. But there is obviously a lot of soul searching going on inside the company. Their morale is not great. Do you think this could actually be a turning point that revives them? 

I think when they're at this position, it's hard to see how it could do anything but get better. I mean, it's been a bad six weeks for them. I think that I'm not 100 percent sure who is going to be in charge of Uber in a couple of years. But I do think -- 

You think that Travis might be pushed out or? 

I think it's unlikely. But, I mean, when you have this much bad press, you start to wonder if somebody like Travis might decide to say, you know, it would be better if somebody else is running the company. Somebody less controversial. That said, no matter what happens at the top of Uber, I think, yeah, I think that this is healthy and they will get better. And I think on the other hand, you do have companies like Lyft trying to capitalize on this. I mean, I think that one way or the other, that driver, that business is going to exist, and people are going to use it. And maybe it will be Uber, maybe it will be Lyft, but that's a real thing. 

Companies do recover from this. If you look at Netflix, it's not directly comparable, but when Reed Hastings decided to split the company up when they were getting out of the CD business and devoting themselves to the online streaming business and he wrote all those blogs and he got all of his shareholders angry at him and the stock tanked and I think I wrote "Vanity Fair" article about him at that very moment. And then it's like a miracle. It got completely turned around. Carl Icahn bought into the stock at that low point. He made five times his money. And the stock, and the company became a darling again. So this is a clear moment where if you are a smart corporate leader, you take the bull by the horns at this very moment. And change your corporate culture and show that this could never happen again. Travis has to do that if he wants Uber to get back into the good graces of not only potential employees but of investors and customers. He's the leader and he's misbehaving. That's unacceptable. 

Well, certainly America does love a comeback story. Richard, do you have any examples that you would point to, I mean, where individual leaders have messed up badly and come bouncing back? 

Well, you know, go back to Iacocca at Ford. But I mean, you know, Howard Schultz came back at Starbucks, and you know, he had been a great entrepreneur. He turned the business over to someone. He became chairman. He got interested in the basketball team. And then he came back in 2007 just in time for the great recession. And he brought his team to New Orleans and said, you know, we've got to help fix this wreck from the hurricane, and we got to stand up for our communities. And he's completely turned that business. And so I do believe that, you know, smart leaders can take this moment in time to get out there, lead from the front, but it has to be on the basis of having a great core relationship with your employees. And here's where the great test will come for Travis because it's a different kind of employee. This is a sharing economy relationship. It's not one where they are full time people. I think his issue is in the driver force more than his full time employee but also that he has a sexual harassment issue at home. 

Again, one of the great ironies that you're being hoisted by your own pitard, where essentially Uber has been profitable precisely because it did not have these permanent employees, but of course, because you don't have these permanent employees, your business model is more fragile and they may be less loyal in that way. 

I think there's a very interesting labor story here. And I don't know how it's gonna play out. I mean, Uber drivers and basically sharing economy workers in general are kind of a new class of employee that the world really hasn't figured out, you know, sort of what protections they deserve, how much they need to get paid. And I think that is going to be a big story over the next, you know, decade or even couple of decades, as more of us stop having full time jobs and start, because we either have been replaced by robots or because more people adopt these kind of contractor roles. 

They say there are 53 million so-called contingent workers or self-employed workers now in America, and as you say, these are not covered with any traditional safety net. 

I think it's really important also to say that, you know, driving for Uber is a lifeline to a lot of people. And when you're talking about place -- you know, Uber doesn't just operate in New York and San Francisco. It operates in the rust belt and where my mother lives in Kenosha, Wisconsin. And you know, it's a job, it's a way that you can make money in places where it's very hard to find jobs that pay anything at all. And I think that, you know, as much as Travis and Uber have screwed up, I think it's worth recognizing that they have created opportunity for people both in terms of opportunity for, you know, for passengers and also for drivers. And I think that's part of what makes this story hard and complicated. 

In some ways it is what makes it so emblematic of modern America, both good and bad. I mean, in some ways this is the American dream. This is free market competition in every sense. It is also about democracy, people with cell phones fighting back. But it is also very challenging. 

The interesting moment of time here is that the Trump voter actually is very pro-business. It gives you a license, in a certain way. The other is that business is the most trusted institution by those people who haven't made their minds up about whether the system is working or not working. Business has the chance now, and Uber has to be part of that drive to get to a place where the results are good for the worker and for the customer as well as the shareholder. That's the dream. 

Can I go back to something Richard was talking about before at the beginning, talking about retraining. And maybe Uber could create some sort of fund or goodwill fund to help people get retrained. I think one of the biggest mysteries to me in this election, the so-called Trump voter is someone who is feeling left behind economically, by the last eight years of the Obama, the two Obama administrations. And they don't have a fulfilling job. They don't make the kind of income they would like to. They feel like they lost out somehow. And they are crying out to be retrained. I'm like, I don't understand how you are going to retrain these people. I mean, are you going to take somebody who worked on an assembly line and an auto plant and like somehow transport him or her to Silicon Valley and have them type in code. I don't understand how that is going to work. That's like the big mythologies out there that somehow we're going to retrain this workforce that has been left behind. And I just don't see it happening. I don't know how it is gonna happen. 

The problem as Max points out if they are contingent workers, if they're not even full time employees, why would a company want to retrain them? 

I have done some reporting around driverless cars. And so, yes, obviously, driverless cars could, in the super long run, take a lot of jobs. However, first of all, in the sort of middle term, say between five and ten years, there's actually gonna be tons and tons of jobs created to sort of help make this possible. And that includes engineers but it also includes what is sort of known in the business as safety driver. These are people who sit in the driverless car and essentially operate the computer that is operating the car. And that's actually a pretty good job that requires some training but not a lot of training and it is the kind of job that would be trained by the employee, by Uber, by the employer, by Google or Uber. The other thing is, I spent some time looking at trucking companies lately. And there are a lot visions for how driverless trucks might work. Obviously, truck drivers, that is a huge sector of the economy, employs a lot of men without college degrees. And what I think will happen in the long run is those people are still gonna be employed, they're just gonna be like computer operators. So if you are a truck driver, your job is going to change, and it is going to require certain skills, but it's not like you have to become a really great coder. You just have to be able to operate this machine that is operating the machine. That is the kind of thing that a company can do. 

I don't understand driverless anything, I'm sorry. (LAUGHTER) I know everybody is talking about that. I know it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But I don't want to get in a car without a driver. I don't want to get in a plane without a pilot even though -- 

I think one of the scary things is that, you know, as of yet, Washington has barely begun to even discus these issues and think about how they are going to deal with the loss of jobs as Richard said, and the question of how they protect workers or don't protect them. Instead we have this fascinating break point where there are stories like the story of Travis with the driver of breaking into public consciousness, putting these issues on the map and yet we don't have any answers at all yet. 

I also think that tech company should use this moment in time to begin to turn the globalization debate. This idea somehow that America has been deeply disadvantaged by trade is so fallacious. That the tech companies are the winners in IP, in selling products through a global supply chain. They have affordable products that they can sell through Walmart that otherwise, you know, people couldn't afford. And the whole mythology around job loss is just that. And so this is a really important topic that the business community -- compared to NAFTA, the job on TPP was so poor. It was all led by government and totally the opposite to 20 years before on NAFTA. And this is the moment for the tech companies to stand up and not just them, but also the customers, the dry cleaner or the small business person who's running it on a PC that costs, you know, 700 bucks instead of 1200. This is critical to the success of the economy forward. 

This is where tech and the financial world coincide and the echoes of history become very strong. I must say next time I hail an Uber or Lyft or any other thing, I will think about this as being a symbol of the American dream for both good, bad, and the challenges. But thank you for a fascinating discussion. Thank you Max, Richard, and Bill. And best of luck in figuring out what will happen next. Thank you.
