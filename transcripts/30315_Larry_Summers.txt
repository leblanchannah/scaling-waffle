President Trump's plans to revitalize the economy retreated last week after the Republican's inability to pass a health-care bill. That failure calls into question whether the president can deliver on an ambitious pro-growth agenda. The administration has turned its attention to tax reform and is expected to unveil a $1 trillion infrastructure plan later. Larry Summers is president emeritus of Harvard. He served as Treasury Secretary under President Clinton and is director of President Obama's National Economic Council. And I'm very pleased to have him back at this table, welcome. 

Good to be with you, Charlie. It's great to see you back at this table. 

It's a pleasure to be back and it's a pleasure to have you here. Let's just start talking about the U.S. economy. Where is it? We have seen what's happening in the market. What do you anticipate? 

No one can know. I think it's about as it's been. I think this growth has been on one side or the other of two percent, pretty consistently. And right now it looks like that's where it will be this year. Markets have been up, but how long that will last, I think very much remains to be seen. A bunch of what people think was driving up the market was the expectation that there be a huge new wave of business-friendly policy. That doesn't look as likely as it did given that the administration seems to be having more trouble moving things through a Republican Congress than I think people expected several weeks ago. And I think there's an increasing sense of unease and uncertainty. So, I think we're -- I don't think an extra session is around the corner, but then again, we never see recessions coming nine months or a year in advance. So I think the best guess would probably be growth around the range we've seen with at least as much risk to the downside as to the upside. And I have a suspicion that people may look at some of the very high sentiment figures, some of the things that have been said, perhaps even what has happened in markets as a bit of a sugar high when people look back at this episode. 

They talk about three percent growth this year. They talk about reaching four percent, is that reasonable? 

No. Anything can happen. So if you forecast, say things are inconceivable, you're usually wrong in economics. But if somebody said I'm going to flip ten coins and I expect that seven or eight of them will come up heads, that would be kind of a crazy forecast, even though it was a conceivable outcome. That's what I would say about the forecast of three to four percent growth. They don't have anything in place that offers the prospect of an acceleration of growth in that magnitude. And I don't think they've got particularly the right economic policies on some important dimensions, but even if they did have the right economic policies, I don't think we know how to push the growth rate up by nearly that much, nearly that rapidly. 

But two hallmarks of what you have been saying to me over the last few years is, one, growth is essential and the best way to get that is through some kinds of physical actions. 

That's right, it was much more true when we had higher unemployment and lots of excess capacity than it is today. I still think a program of real public investment could yield some very important benefits by putting people who dropped out of the labor force back to work, by making the economy function more efficiently. I don't think the tax cut schemes, tax credit schemes for infrastructure that the administration has talked about are likely to be particularly availing. And I'm not sure they will be able to form consensus on it. I think the right deal is a deal where the administration and the Republicans in Congress agree to commit substantial money for infrastructure, and the Democrats accept regulation changes that will permit some streamlining of doing major projects more quickly and more efficiently. I've heard it said that the Second Avenue subway costs five times what an equivalent subway would cost in France. And France isn't usually regarded as an economy that is a paragon of efficiency. So I think we need to look both at the quantity of resources we're devoting to infrastructure, and the efficiency with which we do it. But I don't think that's centrally about adopting some kind of private scheme with the tax credit. I think those ideas such as the ones that now Secretary Ross put forward during the campaign -- 

Wilbur Ross. 

Wilbur Ross, yes, exactly, are -- they may do something by making there be more pipelines and that's fine. But I'm not sure that's getting at the most critical of our infrastructure issues. You know, I fly into the LaGuardia and Kennedy airports all the time, they don't make one proud as the gateways to the greatest city and the greatest country on earth. 

So what would be your priorities for infrastructure spending and what would be the level of spending you think is essential? 

I think the economy could probably absorb an extra one percent of GDP for the next decade. That would total over ten -- over ten years, about two and half, two to two and a half trillion dollars. You would have to phase into that. I think the priorities would be many that include a lot in transportation, roads, airports. 

Bridges. 

Bridges, bridges to some extent, in some strategic areas, railroads. There is a substantial need for an infrastructure related to water, clean water, levees so that we don't have another Katrina. There's a need for reforms that will permit more satisfactory transmission of power so that we can make greater use of renewables and move the electricity from where it's windy, where it's sunny, and we can use renewables to the places that -- 

But that's a storage capacity problem. 

-- need the electricity. Some of it is a storage capacity, and some of it is a transportation problem. But both of those involve infrastructure in important ways. I think all of that would be very constructive. I think there are issues around our telecommunications infrastructure, it's gotten better in the last two or three years, but if I make a phone call from my office on the road from the Beijing Airport to Beijing, that phone call is less likely to drop than if I do it on the road in from Kennedy to New York or from Logan in to Boston. That's not about the government being willing to spend money. That is about various rules that bear on siting and the ability to site cell phone towers and the like and it's about the way we manage our endowment of spectrum. 

Would you make the budget and the spending deficit neutral? 

I would be willing, in order to make investments, to be short of neutral and here's why. Deferred maintenance is a deficit. It's just one we don't count. If we defer maintenance, it's placing a burden on to my children, my children's taxes are going to have to pay for many years from now just as surely as borrowing money. It's just there is one difference. When you defer maintenance, the cost compounds at five percent, seven percent, ten percent a year, according to the best estimates. When you borrow money in the markets, nowadays you pay one percent, two percent, maybe three percent. So borrowing money in order to invest in reducing that backlog of deferred maintenance is an arbitrage. You are borrowing at a lower cost than the return you're earning, and therefore, you're actually making it better, not lesser for future generations. And that's why I would feel comfortable engaging in borrowing for investment. I don't think this is the right time to borrow for consumption at the public level. We should have done more of that years ago. And if we had, we would have had a more rapid recovery. But now as the economy approaches full employment, I think the primary consequence of doing that would be to push up interest rates. And the better course is for the government to finance what it needs to spend. That is why I'm not enthusiastic about large unpaid-for tax cuts. 

A number of people have suggested that what is happening in terms of taking away regulations in the area of energy, ahead will cause the Chinese to seize leadership of climate control and their own development -- Tom Friedman had a column about that, other people have written about it even today -- is there a risk if the United States budget, as suggested, does what it is going to do with respect to energy and also with the lack of a commitment to science and the National Endowment of Arts, will have a detrimental effect on our leadership in the world? 

I think it's a huge -- I think it's a huge thing, Charlie. I think some of it is leadership in the world. Some of it is what kind of society we want to be. Helen Vendler, one of the most distinguished professors at Harvard, said in her Jefferson lecture to the National Endowment of Humanities that civilizations are remembered much more for the acts of beauty that they cultivate than they are for the decisions of politicians, something to that effect. And I think they're remembered much more for their great creations than they are for any deals they cut. And we seem to have forgotten that. And so in terms of what we are remembered for, are we supporting the next generation of great works of music or art or literature? Are we contributing to the adventure of mankind and understanding our world? That's the ultimate historical significance. But I think it's also goes to something that my Harvard colleague, Joe Nye, has talked about for many years, our soft power. Ultimately, it's the ability to be an attractive example that makes a big difference in how much influence a nation has. And if we stop being the nation that is pushing science, if we stop being the nation of cultural creation, we're going to be much less attractive to others. And that's going to mean seating influence, that's going to mean others will have systems that will be emulated around the world. And I think that will be very, very costly in terms of our influence, and also very costly directly to our economy. 

Do you think that Chinese have, want to assume leadership in the world? Want to be competitive with the United States in that dimension? 

I think the Chinese see a world where 200 years ago they were a dominant civilization on the global stage. And that hasn't been so for the last 200 years. And if you just listen to Xi Jinping, that's something that's very important to the Chinese to restore. Do they look to march into other countries, conquer them and invade them? I don't think so. Do they look to export a revolutionary ideology the way the Russians did after World War II? I don't think so either. But do they look to have a level of influence for their values and on behalf of their companies that is quite questionable from the point of view of our interests? I think that may be the case. And I think we're much more likely to do what is hugely important to do which is to find a successful co-evolution with the Chinese, that in a big world finds room for both of us if we maintain our sense and commitment to national greatness than if we look only to the short run and constrict ourselves to deal cutting. 

So the Thucydides principle that your colleague at Harvard, Graham Allison, has spoken to, need not be true? 

I think that the Thucydides trap that Graham has spoken to, going back to Athens and Sparta and the tensions that exist between strong powers and rising powers is best thought of as a hugely relevant warning, not as an inevitable prophecy. And I think that one part of the response on the part of the United States has to be maintenance of the power of its example. And if we descend in to a tinny cost-cutting mercantilism which is my concern, looking at a number of the policies that we've pursued, I think it will embolden the Chinese in ways that are problematic. It will cause others to shy away from us and bandwagon towards the Chinese in ways that are problematic. And I think ultimately it will undermine the quality of the lives that people here are leading. How can we really say that we cannot afford what is far under one percent, what is far under a tenth of a percent, what is probably actually less than way under a tenth of a percent of the federal budget for supporting everything about culture? That just can't be right for us. And make no mistake, a substantial number of people whose lives would be saved are going to be lost because we've decided to cut the budget for basic science way back. James Watson, Jim Watson was in his 20s when he discovered the structure of DNA. 

28. 

Today, typically young investigators aren't young, they're in their early, mid-40s before they can get their first grant to pursue their ideas, rather than their senior professors ideas from the NIH. Well, if you -- look at creative science, whether it's Jim Watson, whether it's Einstein, whether it's Newton, it mostly happens long before people are in their early 40s. And that is the consequence of the kind of cutbacks that we're going through. And it just doesn't make any sense. If history teaches us anything, Charlie, it is that from things that seem entirely abstract, great things come. Einstein's theory of general relativity was about as abstract and hypothetical as you can imagine. And yet, no GPS system would work without internalizing it. The algorithms that make an ATM transaction secure came out of number theory which is the most basic and theoretical part of mathematics, which is the most basic and theoretical of the sciences. So when we cut back on human curiosity and wonderment and the support of knowledge, we do something that is devastating to the long run. Can I -- can I just -- 

Go ahead. 

Can I add one thing? Something that's really disturbed me in the last weeks has been the approach of our business community. Our business leaders, always when it's them, talk about the importance of long-termism, and activists, shareholders need to get off their back so they can think for the long-term. They know that it's in the United States' interest for there to be an open world trading system. They know that it's in the United States' interest for there to be a big increase in science. But because they're so focused on getting a better deal on a tax cut in 2017, or it's -- or they're so nervous about a Tweet, that's not what they talk about. That's not what the Washington reps talk about. That's not how they influence things. And I think more of those business leaders who have, who do have real influence because it's what this administration respects, need to use that influence in addition to talking about their own regulation, to talk about the really large issues of isolationism, of openness, of basic inquiry that are important. 

But it is a fact that businesses in America have, either because they saw uncertainty or for whatever reason, have not made the kind of investments, both in human resources and in inventory and in building new plants and expansion, that we would've hoped that they would do. Now, it may have had to do with economic times, but they also say that they're stimulated to do that because some regulation that they felt like we're unfair and limiting, as well as tax policy, prevented them from doing it. 

Fair enough. Look, I'm the guy who said twice a week for two years in the Obama administration, confidence is the cheapest form of stimulus. 

Yes, you did. 

We've got to focus on business confidence. I think that we have a better world with the Keystone Pipeline than we would without. I think the new administration came to the right decision on that question when it licensed the Keystone Pipeline. I think there are other areas where regulation needs to be changed. I think the business community is right about that. But where I think they're wrong is in paying no attention in their very energetic participation on public policy to the broader, longer run themes and talking only about what they want and the next tax break and the next bit of deregulation. 

Let me just raise the other question. When you look at the United States today, I once said this to the president, President Obama. You know, you say we have the strongest military. You say we have the highest level of scientific advancement. You say that we have the strongest development in technology. You say that we have the strongest economy. What could go wrong? And he said our politics could go wrong. And my question is, you know, are we at risk now, when you look and see the kind of things that are happening in Washington for our politics to go seriously wrong? 

Yes, I think -- I don't know that it will happen. I tend very much to be with Churchill on America does the right thing, but only after exhausting the alternatives. But I think we are working on a variety of the alternatives right now in some areas. If we manage to not be in a reasonable place in terms of health care, we'll have millions more people who are getting health care without insurance which is going to mean higher costs for everybody else, which is going to mean less competitive business. That's a threat. If we are completely gridlocked and we're not able to do tax reform or infrastructure investment which looks like an increasing risk, that will be very costly for the economy. If we move further towards a Latin American style economy, where the best way to get ahead is to have friends in the government and have the government decide to bestow you favors, or thank you, or avoid being punished by the government, where everybody wakes up every morning thinking about what the head of state is thinking, that will be devastating to our economy. And I've never heard in any previous moment before 2000, I'm worried that the president of the United States is going to call out my company, therefore I have to do X. And that pervasive sense, I think becomes a preoccupation for business. And I think that can be very costly for the economy. And probably most important, we are now hugely an internationalized economy and as an internationalized economy, we depend on the government to maintain successful relations in which we assert American values strongly, but also in a way that's conducive to reaching compromises with the rest of the world, that frankly looks in doubt right now. We have the government as I was explaining with all these innovations as a basic steward of our technological future. I was floored to hear the treasury secretary say three days ago that artificial intelligence and its consequences for job formation wasn't on his or the administration's radar screen because it wasn't going to happen for another 50 to a hundred years. Hello Bill Gates, hello Elon -- Elon Musk. So, yes -- 

Not only that, hello, every corporation in America of any size and any huge technological component is looking at artificial intelligence, you know, as an early adaptation to meet the changes that are with us right now. 

Absolutely. I mean, anyone who has an Alexa, or a Siri knows what those types, how those kinds of systems are moving forward. So all those areas, I am very worried that our politics and therefore, our public policies, are going to let us down. Look, I think there is a really important lesson -- at least this is kind of what I get out of the study of economics around the world -- and that is, government can't make a country rich. You get rich with people who work hard, people who save, people who create in a good economic environment. And government can't do that by itself. 

But government can create the environment to do that. 

But government can sure screw things up by not creating an environment. And it's something that happens slowly, but it all accumulates. In 1900, Argentina was closer to the United States economically than most of Europe is today. Today, we think of Argentina as a poor developing country. Argentine growth only has lagged American growth by 7/10 of a 1 percent over all of that period. So when you get things wrong, when you have dysfunctional governance, it doesn't undo you in a year or five years or even a decade. It does over time. You know, in some ways think of the United States as being like the automobile industry. General Motors at one point appeared all powerful. The concern was that it was too powerful and needed to be broken up by antitrust and all of that. But then mismanagement, lack of functionality of the organization, you had the Japanese threat and all that meant, and then you had the bankruptcy that basically wiped out what had been there before and it needed to be renewed. 

And what you have now at General Motors, it is more competitive, better run than it has been in a long time. 

And I think one of the things that, having served in the Obama administration I'm very proud of, is the way we managed that situation. But I think the General Motors of several decades ago is something we need to think about as we think about what can go wrong in the United States. And as I look at what is happening politically, I think there were storm clouds that have been forming for a long time. But the directions that we seem to be taking in the last few months, particularly as regards our approach to the global economy, particularly as regards the approach we're taking to basic public investments, and particularly as to the approach we're taking trying to make individual businesses be dependent on government rather than focusing on the overall environment, is something that I think is very dangerous. You know, you can think about it as there being law and market-based capitalism, or there being deals-based capitalism. And part of what has been special in the United States has been that we've been the leader of laws and market-based capitalism for a long time. And we've left it to Argentina and Thailand to be deals-based capitalism. Every time the president stands next to a CEO and celebrates that there's been some investment in jobs, or every time the president threatens some particular company, I see us moving towards being deals-based capitalism. And that's something I, at least, think is very dangerous. 

Great to you have here, my friend. 

Good to be with you.
