Richard Gere is here. He is an actor and an activist. He stars in Joseph Cedar's new film, "Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer." He plays an aspiring power player in the New York Jewish community who sees his fortunes rise after befriending a man who later becomes the prime minister of Israel. Film comment calls Gere's performance superb. Here's a look at the trailer. (MUSIC) 

This is good. I've thought it through. I know, I just got to find someone who can actually do this. It's a lot of money. Yeah, Bill Kavish, do you know him? He's a friend. 

We represent clients that do business with him. I don't want to look like I'm asking him for a favor. 

Can I say that we're related? Can I say that I'm your uncle? 

No, no. 

Good morning, Bill. Norman Oppenheimer. 

I have to leave. This is unacceptable. 

So I'll tell my partners that we had a good conversation! (MUSIC) 

May I ask what you do for a living? 

What do you need? I'll help you get it. It will be my privilege to buy you these shoes. 

If I take the shoes, I have to pay for them. 

You don't have to, it's fine. 

Is everything okay? 

Yeah, enjoy. (MUSIC) 

Can you explain to me how your business works? I'm curious. (MUSIC AND CHEERING) 

If you ever need anything, feel free to call. (MUSIC) 

To be practical, we need to raise approximately $14 million to save us from the wrecking ball and this is where our friend Norman Oppenheimer comes in. 

Do you know Norman Oppenheimer? 

No, I don't. 

Congressman, very nice to meet you. 

Mr. Taub would like to speak with you. Would you mind joining me? 

You were in Arthur Taub's house? 

Yes. 

This is my private home. You can't just walk in it and sit at my table. 

Can I introduce you to him some time? You know who he is, right? 

Don't waste my time! 

Yeah, but Joe, this is time sensitive. 

You spoke to him? 

I'm not following you, Norman, did you speak to him or not? 

Why haven't you returned my phone calls? 

Why do I get the feeling nothing you tell me is real? 

Let's just say, get ready for a big surprise. (MUSIC) 

You're like a drowning man trying to wave at an ocean liner. 

But I'm a good swimmer, don't forget that. (MUSIC) Something good will happen. Trust me. 

I am pleased to have my friend, Richard Gere, back at this table. Welcome. 

Welcome. Welcome to you, man. (LAUGHTER) Good to have you back. We were just talking about what you've gone through. 

I know. So why do you say this is maybe the best film you've done in a long, long time, if not ever? 

Maybe ever. I don't know. It's certainly one of the best. I think it's -- 

Good director, starting with. 

First rate. 

Israeli director, Joseph Cedar. 

Joseph Cedar is an Israeli director who's made several wonderful films, one of which was "Footnotes," which he won the Cannes prize for best screenplay. 

Yes. 

And the first one I saw was "Beaufort," about a young soldier, Israeli soldier. But this is a -- people will see, you will see this movie -- first of all, it's something I've never done before. 

In what way? 

It's as far away from my instincts as it could possibly be. 

Really? What do you mean, your instincts are what? That you should do a certain kind of thing? 

No, no. Instincts as a person -- 

Because you've done every kind of thing. 

No, I'm not talking like that, just my instincts as Richard Gere were not at all the instincts of this character, so I had to completely get out of myself to embrace this guy and let him do the walking and talking for me. 

Who is Norman Oppenheimer? 

Norman Oppenheimer is a, he's a "macher" is what he is. That's why we use the word "fixer." He's trying to put something together all the time. He's got a deal here working, he's got a deal there -- 

He wants to be on the inside. 

He wants to get in. He wants to belong. He wants to be part of what's happening. He wants to be one of the cool kids. 

Yes. 

He wants to -- and you can see this was his whole life of inventing himself, changing the story, name dropping, pushing, pulling, anything to get in, scratching, and a lifetime of doors being closed in his face. 

And then he meets somebody that he befriends. 

Well, he never quite knows what's going to happen, he's kind of open to all the possibilities around him. And he goes to a meeting of Israeli ministers in New York. And he sees a younger one. It's part of commerce and oil. 

Right. 

Younger, not very powerful. No one's paying any attention to him. It's all about the prime minister. But him, maybe he's got a possibility, and he kind of follows him out of there and creates a meeting with him. 

This is apropos to where we are -- 

Exactly where we are, I think. (LAUGHTER) 

Norman Oppenheimer from New York. 

Norman! Norman, my friend! Where have you been? I have been trying to reach you. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) (MUSIC) Hannah, Hannah, do you know Norman? 

Nice to meet you. 

This is my wife, Norman Oppenheimer. 

Yes. 

Norman is going to be my special honorary ambassador to New York... My personal special advisor. 

I am? 

Yes, of course. Look around you, Norman, there are over 500 organizations represented in this room. It is a tremendous force of nature. Unprecedented in our history. We need to understand how this incredible force unites around the issues that are important to the Jewish people and to the world. Stay with us. 

Congressman Bob Easterly. 

Hello Bob, how are you? You know Norman Oppenheimer? 

No, I don't. 

Congressman, very nice to meet you. 

This is my wife, Joyce. 

Very nice meeting you, too. This is my nephew, Philip Cohen. I think he's the youngest partner in Frankel, Zoel, Gould, and Rudolph. (LAUGHTER) 

One of the youngest. 

I'm sorry. 

Nice to meet you, Philip. We represented Toby Tabochnik -- 

Oh, yeah, yeah, Toby, Toby. 

Toby, Toby, he married a Solomon. Bette, Charlie Solomon's daughter! (MUSIC) 

So what's happening? 

Well, this is in the middle of the film, This is when he -- 

He realizes he has power. 

He's in. 

He's in, he's on the inside. 

The rest of the scene we didn't show, I'm glad, because it's an incredible scene, of being embraced in reality, but also, in an expressionistic way of, the heavens open up, and it's the first time in a man's life that the whole world is going, yes! 

And he's desperately wanted it to happen? 

Oh, we all do. 

Yes. 

We all want to walk in a room and people turn and smile. They're happy we're here. 

It's a nice feeling. 

Yes. (LAUGHTER) 

But you say it's the best thing you've done in a long time, ever, let's say. 

No, it's one of the best things. 

Okay, one of the best things. Is it because of the director? Is it because of -- 

A combination of a lot of things. He wrote a great script, he's a great director, the cast is extraordinary. 

And then what about you? 

It's harder for me to see myself. I'm happy with the work. 

So it's possible a director got a performance out of you that other directors had not? 

Or I got a great direction out of a director. 

Yes. 

How do you know? 

But it feels good. And do you know when it's happening? Did you feel how good this film was when you were -- 

No, you never know if a film is gonna work while you're doing it, there is no way of knowing. You can bet on a script. 

Yes. 

I'm smart enough to know a script at this point, a terrific script, but you don't know in the end if those bizarre elements that make up a two-hour form of storytelling are going to come together or not. You never know that. You can bet based on instinct and empirical things like good director, good script, terrific cast, D.P., the whole thing. 

And how much of it is that you simply got this character? 

Well, that's a lot of it, of course, but that won't tell you that the movie's going to work. It will tell you that you're going to have a good time every day you show up to work because the thing is going to flow, some magic can happen because you're able to let go. We worked -- Joseph and I worked eight or nine months on this before we started shooting just so we'd be on the same wavelength. 

What did you do for eight or nine months? 

Well, the process is kind of funny. We were talking about it today. As soon as that script is delivered -- and he says, I'm going to send you the script, I want you to do my movie -- from that moment, you're rehearsing. You read the script, you go, oh, okay. And immediately something starts happening. You meet the next time, already, you're working on the movie, no matter what's going on. You go for a walk, you make some tea, you read the newspaper, you're talking to each other, you're not. You have an idea, you go see a movie. Whatever you're doing from that point on is on some level rehearsing what you're going to do in this movie and what it's going to be. So -- and I like this process. It's a slow dream-like process where things get deeper and deeper all the time. 

What's interesting is here's a guy who was struggling to be in as a fixer, as whatever he wanted to be. 

Yeah, I mean, he's pretty low level. 

Yes, I see. 

This is not a power broker. 

But you said you could identify with this guy. I mean, you have -- I mean, you were a major movie star when you were, what -- how old? 

I don't know. I don't know. Movies started coming out in my late 20s, I guess. 

Yes, late 20s. I would say late 20s. And you also had the critical success to go with it from what you did. 

I was very fortunate. There are no classes for this, no books. 

You can't -- you can't. 

No one, no matter what you think it's going to be like, you will never know until it happens. 

Until it happens. 

And you are either smart enough to take a deep breath and step back a little bit or not. 

What is it that the prime minister sees in Norman? Is it just friendship? Is it just somebody who was there for him? 

I think he sees a good heart, to tell you the truth; most politicians -- 

Something authentic. 

It's bizarre because everything the guy says is a lie. 

Yes, right. 

Norman has only a very faint acquaintance with the truth. But there is something -- he's a true-hearted person and he's a loyal person. And I think that may be part of that initial falling in love, of just -- he's kind of a sad sack. He's actually kind of a Charlie Chaplain character. And I think Eshel sees this kind of sweetness in him. 

Take a look at this. This is Norman trying to evade a rabbi played by Steve Buscemi. Take a look. 

Rabbi, it's Norman. 

I know, I've been calling you all morning. Why don't you answer your phone? 

I'm answering now. Do you want to hear what I have to say? 

Yeah, you spoke to him? What did he say? 

Let's just say, get ready for a big surprise. 

How many zeros are at the end of the surprise? Can you tell me that at least? 

Come on! A considerable surprise, that's it. I've got to go, Rabbi. 

No, Norman, you realize how important this is, right? We're going to be kicked out of here. You need to give us a firm answer. No games, Norman. 

I can't hear a word you're saying. 

Norman! Norman! Goddammit! 

How is the Rabbi connected to this again, Norman? Remind me, why am I doing this? 

You want Rabbi Blumenthal to marry you or not? All you have to do is to pick up the phone, call one of your buddies at Harvard on behalf of the prime minister of Israel. Is that really so difficult for you? 

Don't belittle what I'm doing, okay? In the world of Harvard admissions, this is the biggest no-no in the book. It's like incest, it's taboo. 

That's funny because Rabbi Blumenthal is gonna think exactly the same thing when he finds out I'm asking him to marry a Cohen and a convert, who isn't even officially converted! 

What is the tragic fall -- well, you won't tell me this -- but the tragic fall. (LAUGHTER) 

The interesting thing I found out about Norman in playing him, which surprised me, is that there was no anger in him. He gets hurt, and he's humiliated, time after time. This is a kind of Charlie Chaplain side of him. There's no anger. 

"Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer" opens in theaters on Friday. Friday, April 14th. Richard Gere. 

Thanks, Charlie. 

Thank you for joining us. 

See you around. 

My pleasure. Thanks, pal.
