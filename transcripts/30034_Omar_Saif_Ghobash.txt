Good evening. I'm Jon Meacham, filling in for Charlie Rose. Omar Saif Ghobash is here. He is the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Russia. His new book is called "Letters to a Young Muslim." It consists of a series of personal correspondences to his older son. It seeks to answer the question of how moderate Muslims can find a voice that is true to Islam while engaging in the modern world. I am pleased to welcome the ambassador to this table. Welcome, sir. 

Thank you very much. 

So, what was the origin of the letters to your son? 

Well, the idea of sort of collecting a set of principles and concepts goes back quite a long way to the time when I was 15 -- 14, 15, and I was myself going through a phase of asking many different questions and not finding the answers in our culture. But there was a sense in which you couldn't pose those questions. What I noticed as time went by is the situation hadn't changed and I noticed exactly the same processes occurring in my older son and also my younger son and, so, I decided, you know, if nobody else had done it, then I should make my best effort to try to sort of put a kind of framework around those questions and try to explain how the possible answers might come about. 

Was there a literary example in your mind? 

No, as I said a couple of times before in private that my initial version was a kind of "Das Kapital" by Marx. (LAUGHTER) 

Shorter. (LAUGHTER) 

No, the original version was much longer. And so my editor said, look, wonderful, but you really should think about actually addressing people's concerns here, so she gave me the idea of addressing my son. I thought, that's fantastic. As soon as that happened, everything began to flow. Everything began to simplify itself. Actually, when I read the book -- when I reread it, I am really pleased with the way the language has kind of broken down into very basic elements here. 

Sure. Is this the way you talk to him? 

It is actually the way I talk to him. I talk to my younger son as well in the same manner. Of course, the subject matter will be slightly different, but I think it's important to be able to explain things in a fairly simple manner. And I think it was also something I was taught at university. Don't be enamored of long words. Try to express things as simply as possible. The ideas can be complex but the presentation should be easy. 

Right. Now, I admire you for having a 16 year old and a 14 year old who could listen to this. I have a 14 year old who I don't think would read a letter from me. (LAUGHTER) Tell me what was the most important message you wanted to get across? I mean, this is a complicated time in the Muslim world, a complicated time in the western world. There are still some who want to say that it's an enduring clash of civilizations. There are others who would like to see co-existence and reform be possible. What was the impetus? What's your message to them? 

Well, my message is actually something about our personal responsibility within the faith. So people can talk about a clash of civilizations, so between civilizations, I think there is a clash within our own civilization, within our own Islamic community, and I think it's particularly worrisome and also kind of tantalizing in a way. There are 1.7 billion Muslims, and the kinds of ways in which we discuss issues with each other have not really progressed in the sense that there is a tremendous amount that is kept under wraps so that, you know, it takes place behind the scenes in private homes and so on. And I've received a certain amount of feedback from young Arabs and young Muslims and people as far away as Indonesia. And they tell me thank you for putting words on some of the feelings that I've had. Thank you for breaking a certain kind of taboo in speaking about so many issues. So I think that's very important. I want to demonstrate that all of these taboos are choices that we have made, our society's made these choices, and that we actually need to begin to legitimize the vast population that lives in fear of discussing their own issues. 

You -- what is your greatest fear for, say, your 16 year old, growing up in an Islamic world that has been given to extremism? Do you worry he would be surrounded by people who have been radicalized? Do you worry about his own susceptibility, potentially? 

In the case of my older son, no, I'm not particularly worried about him. There was a moment where I did worry that he was, you know, interested in the wrong ideas. Initially, you could think of it as curiosity, but when he began to defend those ideas, I thought it was maybe not so. 

Which wrong ideas? 

For example, the time when he got a copy of a biography of Osama bin Laden. He began to think, you know, perhaps he had point. But this is an extremely important issue and it takes me back to September 11, and the events on September 11 were tragic and evil and a crime. And it made me think very clearly that we must not as Arabs and Muslims, even if we think that we have been the victims of a crime, we shouldn't repay it with a crime. Because that just makes a nonsense of our ethical system. And so I felt that was extremely important. My son, you know, after a few weeks, dropped that idea and moved on. But he's representative of a certain category of young men or women who may look at certain actors within our world, within the Arab world and the Muslim world, and say, oh, well, these are really quite heroic fellows, they've made a big sacrifice. So I want to take all that negative energy and try to transform it into something much more constructive and productive. 

Why do you believe that Islam has been, broadly put, more resistant to the liberalization, the kind of appreciation of diversity that you argue for, that you allude to in the book? 

Well, I don't think its anything intrinsic to Islam. I actually think that it's more of a cultural representation. We have fairly, let's say top-down autocratic systems, patriarchal systems in the Arab world. The Arab world is basically the heartland of Islam. It is the -- the Arabic language is the language in which Islam is transmitted. So I think that, you know, if we look more broadly across the Islamic world, what happens in the Arab world and the Arabic language will then transmit itself to the rest of the Islamic world. That's one thing. So when we look at the structures, the clerical structures within the Islamic world and the Arabic world, they're very, very top-down again, they're a kind of a self-replicating class of scholars. These are people who will spend 30, 50 years, or more, studying the Quran and studying the sayings of the prophets. And they've really devoted their lives to this. There is a certain point where you cannot challenge them, and part of the magic is that they teach young men and women that they are the ones who know, they are the kind of the keyholders or gatekeepers to our moral knowledge. And so that empowers them and essentially kind of creates a large group of people who have to submit to their authority. So what I am trying to do in the book is to say, more knowledge is within the access or within reach of anybody, and if -- what kind of religion do we have if we need to spend 50 years studying the religious text in order to come up with a moral position? And, you know, I've spoken to religious scholars about this and I said, I do not have a religious background, in the sense that I haven't been trained, but I believe I have the right as a human being to engage in moral discussion. And the answer was fairly negative. If you don't have the expertise, therefore you mustn't. 

To move to your diplomatic post for a moment. Where do you -- I know you're in Moscow but you've been here-- Where do you see America's view of Islam moving, particularly given our presidential election? 

Yes, of course, I witnessed the Muslim ban, and I thought that was very interesting. My initial kind of response was that I look at the United States as a set of laws and a set of fundamental values all embodied in a constitution and a constitutional system that seems to be working, you know -- 

We're testing it, but yes. (LAUGHTER) 

But isn't that where we prove that it exists? 

Exactly. 

Yes. So, for me, I think it's an exceptional lesson for the rest of the world where we have been told for the last two decades, the American democracy, the founding fathers, their genius, now this is demonstrating really be the practical outcomes of that genius. So I think, you know, it's very important for us to observe. I don't -- myself, you know, I don't take a personal position on the approach of the administration to the seven countries on the list of the ban. It just surprised me and a number of others that there was ever an expectation that we could get visas so easily to come to the U.S., you know. 

Right. 

There is an element of surprise there. 

Off this point, but again, tied to your diplomatic post, where do you see the Trump administration's relationship with Moscow at this point? Are you as puzzled as many of the rest of us? 

Not entirely. I mean, my personal view from where I'm sitting in Moscow is that the entire relationship has been somewhat exaggerated and somewhat fictionalized. And has become more of a political football within American kind of establishment politics. 

You mean the tensions have been exaggerated or the relationship? 

The supposed relationship that Trump and his -- 

Yes, the Trump-Putin relationship, alleged relationship. 

Yes, exactly. You know, my other reading of the situation is that with so much kind of -- with so much inability to see where the administration is going, I think the Russians will probably behave in a way that suggests that they're not expecting anything from the Americans anyway. 

Got it. 

Yes, so. 

What's the reaction to the book? First of all, what was your son's reaction? 

Great pride. My youngest son is reading 15 pages a day and he's loving it. My older son has -- he came across a couple of the chapters that upset him quite a bit, particularly about my father's passing. So that put him off. But I have -- I don't want to pressure him to read, but I have asked him to read the book in the next few weeks. 

Tell us the story of your dad. 

My father, wonderful man. Precocious child, very, very smart. At the age of 12, he was giving sermons in the mosque. At age 14, he had -- I think this was in probably 1948, '49, he had already become a Marxist communist. Very, very interesting kind of background. He then spent some time in Iraq trying to get an education, didn't have any money. Finally, in his 30s, he was offered a scholarship to the Soviet Union to get a university education. He did that. He married my mother there. That's why I'm half Russian, half Emirati. Or 100 percent Emirati, half Arab. (LAUGHTER) 

Be careful, that's right. 

Yes. He was minister of state for foreign affairs and I think in '74, '77 he was killed in a terrorist incident in Abu Dhabi. And what makes it doubly tragic was that it was an accidental killing. The person beside him was the intended target. 

And the effect of losing him so young on you? 

You know, I don't want to feel sorry for myself, but it's coming up to 40 years and it's something that I will carry with me till the end of my life. What I did notice was that my relationship to my father's passing had knock-on effects on my children. 

Sure. 

And I noticed this with my nieces and nephews and I had a chat with my brothers and sister and I said, you know, we really need to put an end to this pain. We really need to make a stand and say, you know, an incident that happened 40 years ago should not now begin to cripple our children. So it makes me empathize tremendously with other victims of violence, whether it's domestic or political or religious violence. I think it's exceptionally important that we all stand and push back against this strange kind of theology of violence we're finding in the Arab world. 

Absolutely. Let me ask you to read the closing, your closing note. 

Thank you very much. 

To your sons. 

Yes. In ending these letters to you, Saif, I want you to promise yourself that you will always maintain your dignity, your individuality, and your independence of mind. If you can do this, you will be likelier to see life for what it is and what it can be. You will be the decider of your own path. You should also insist on discerning the dignity, individuality, and independence of mind in others. By presuming others are similarly endowed, you will create the space for them to rise to the challenge, to express themselves, and to live up to our highest standards. Now go and write your own letters. (LAUGHTER) Thank you very much. 

Thank you. The book is "Letters to a Young Muslim." Thank you, Ambassador Ghobash. 

Thank you. 

Good luck with it.
