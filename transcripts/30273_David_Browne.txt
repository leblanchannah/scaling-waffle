Chuck Berry, the legendary singer/songwriter and rock originator died on Saturday at his home near Wentzville, Missouri. He was 90. His unique views of Blues and Country define Rock 'N' Roll and influenced everyone from The Beatles to The Beach Boys. His hit songs including "Johnny B. Goode," "Maybellene," Roll Over Beethoven," and "Around and Around. The Rolling Stones called Berry a true pioneer of Rock 'N' Roll. They went on to say, "Chuck was not only a brilliant guitarist, singer, and performer, but most importantly, he was a master craftsman as a songwriter. His songs will live forever." Joining me now David Browne, a contributing editor for "Rolling Stone." I'm pleased to have him at this table for the first time. Welcome. 

Thanks, Charlie. Glad to be here. 

So, what do we say about Chuck Berry? 

You know, God, there is so much to say and so much that you can take for granted. I mean, you know, Rock 'N' Roll has been around now for 60 years. And you sort of can forget after all that time what he did to revolutionize the music. And he really did on so many levels, in music and lyrical levels. 

But did he revolutionize it or revolutionize music by bringing on Rock 'N' Roll? 

He revolutionized music by bringing together one of the very first people to kind of bring together Blues, Country, Boogie-Woogie, and all these styles into Rock 'N' Roll. And more importantly, you know, you look back and people like Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis were very kind of sexual and threatening, and Chuck Berry really wasn't that, but he did something much more important which is he wrote songs in the voice of the average teenager, which really, nobody was doing at that point. 

So, is he genius as a guitarist or as a songwriter? 

It's both. You know, that lick, that one finger, slippery little lick that we hear, you know, it lives on in the music, he invented that. And he played music -- he played guitar like on different downbeats and things, so he kind of revolutionized the sound. That famous, you know, lick -- Chuck Berry lick we hear in every song and everybody still duplicates, nobody was doing that before him. (MUSIC) (SINGING) Oh, Maybellene... Why can't you be true? Oh, Maybellene... Why can't you be true? You've started back doing the things you used to do... So, that's a real basic building block of modern Rock 'N' Roll. 

And so therefore you see songwriters like Bruce Springsteen and guitarists like Keith Richards... 

Right, right. 

...paying tribute today. 

Right, absolutely. The guitar sound lives on. And, you know, the lyrical content, again, you know, he, you know, he wrote songs unabashedly filled with references to cars and drive-ins and high-fives and school cafeterias. You know, he knew how to kind of zero in on the market, I guess you could say. But he knew, you know, he articulated something about this whole new generation of teenagers, he related to them even though he wasn't a teenager at all when he wrote these songs, but he really knew how to craft language in their voice and speak for them. 

It was 1958 that "Johnny B. Goode" made it on Billboard's Top Ten. 

Right. 

'58. 

1958, long time ago. 

Yes. 

Almost 60 years. 

Yes. 

You know, and that wasn't even, you know, "Maybellene" was three years before that. So, you know, he was on an incredible role for five, six, seven years, just singing, you know, recording these songs over, you know, one after another, and those songs -- you know, "Johnny B. Goode," "Maybellene," "Roll Over Beethoven" -- those are the basic -- that's the basic repertoire of early Rock 'N' Roll. (SINGING) I'm gonna write a little letter... Gonna mail it to my local DJ... It's a jumpin' little record I want my jockey to play... (MUSIC) Roll Over Beethoven, and tell Tchaikovsky the news... 

Was he appreciated all along? 

Well, I think he was. You know, he had a difficult period there where he went to prison for 20 months in the early '60s, thanks to the Mann Act. And he kind of disappears from the scene, you know, he emerged from that seemingly much more embittered, but -- and the music that he played in the '50s, by the early '60s, mid-'60s, was, had moved, you know, music had moved on. You had Bob Dylan, Beatles, The Rolling Stones, but all those people kind of worshipped him and grew up with him. So even though he disappears from the scene for awhile, he was sort of newly appreciated when he kind of came back. 

Was there a lot of electric guitar before he came along? 

Electric guitar was -- there was electric guitar before he came on, absolutely, but it didn't quite sound like that, you know, you had the kind of like Les Paul, kind of very smooth style. You didn't have like the way -- the way that Chuck played it in a more kind of playful, you know, somewhat more -- somewhat aggressive but very playful kind of way. (SINGING) Go, Johnny, go, go... Go, Johnny, go, go... Go, Johnny, go, go... Go, Johnny, go, go... Johnny B. Goode... 

He toured until three years ago. 

He was amazing. 

2014. 

He was amazing. You know, one of the poignant things here is that just a few months ago, they announced that he was putting out a new album at 90 years old, which -- and he hadn't put out a new album since 1979, I mean, Jimmy Carter was president when he put out his last album and so it was like, Oh my God, he is not only still playing shows, he's writing new songs at 90, which is, again, groundbreaking in Rock 'N' Roll. You don't have -- we haven't -- we hadn't seen that before. Luckily, that album is finally going to come out so we'll get to hear it. 

Did his music evolve over the years? 

You know, not in a major way. He pretty much stuck to his basic kind of style. Some of his later -- songs in the later '60s might reference, you know, drug dealers or pot, or they got a little modernized in a way in some of his takes on it, but he kind of stuck to that basic style and he also expanded into Blues. He got in, you know, his music spread out a little bit more and exploring the different -- the origins. He dug more into the origins of where he came from, so you will be hearing some very cool, kind of more Blues going to his songs later. 

What influence on Elvis? 

Influence on Elvis, boy, you know, they sort of came out right around the same time and, you know, it's hard to say, you know. They were both -- they were both on parallel courses in a way, you know. I think -- I think -- again, I think, you know, Elvis was so volcanic and sexual and threatening to some people. And Chuck Berry, he was more like this ambassador, this sort of -- to Rock 'N' Roll. You know, he kind of made it -- he put a sort of playful face on it and made it -- he made it Americana in a way, that maybe someone like Elvis -- 

Yes, the songs have been covered by Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, The Doors, The Grateful Dead, James Taylor, and Dwight Yoakam. That's a wide variety. 

It's an amazing list, you know, Green Day, you know, everything from country to punk bands. If you're in a garage band, you probably still have to learn how to play those licks when you grow up. And, you know, that's -- that is quite a legacy for him, you know, 60 years later that those songs are still being covered, that doesn't happen with everybody in Rock 'N' Roll. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thanks, Charlie. 

We'll be right back, stay with us.
