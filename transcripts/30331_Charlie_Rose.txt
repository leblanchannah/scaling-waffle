Stay with us. 

Last week, President Trump signed an executive order designed to unravel former President Obama's climate change initiatives, and also, to revive the coal industry. President Trump made it clear that his administration has no intention of living up to the commitments laid out in the 2015 Paris agreement. In what many consider a major role reversal, China appears poised to step into the leadership void created by the president. Joining me now is Barbara Finamore. She is a senior lawyer and Asia director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. We're pleased to have her here. Welcome. 

My pleasure. 

Tell me the impact of what the president has done with, as a consequence of these executive orders. 

Trump has announced a slew of new executive orders designed to dismantle the Obama administration's energy, climate, and clean air actions. 

Lay out what he has dismantled. 

Well, he has called for rolling back the clean power plant that sets limits on what power plants in the United States can emit in terms of CO2 emissions. It is not clear that he will be able to do that any time soon, however. Because he has to follow the law in the same way that it took us to develop those regulations, he's gonna have to put that up for public comment and give good reasons for why this needs to be dismantled. And then also, defend that action in court. So that may take quite some time. During that time, it is expected that the renewable energy business in the United States will be the fastest growing in the electricity sector. Trump has also called for -- 

That's good then, isn't it? 

That is a very good thing. That is a very good thing. So it is unclear what type of impact his actions will have. He's trying to prop up the coal industry and despite exhaustive analysis by many showing that it is not going to come back, the coal industry is not going to -- 

The thrust of that for him is simply to create jobs. 

Yes, but he is ignoring the fact that today in the United States, the solar industry alone employs roughly twice as many people as the oil, coal, and natural gas industries combined. So it's not really going to grow jobs. In fact, I think the main impact of what Trump has announced is that he is going to put the U.S. in danger of losing out on the biggest new global energy -- the big new global industry of any kind which is the transition to clean energy. 

But in fact, Tom Friedman wrote a column about that, about that very idea, that China will become a leader where the United States should be, and it was poised to be. But China coming on so strong because of the huge size of its issues and its problems, you know, has therefore been forced to accelerate alternative energy sources. 

That's true. China is the leader in investment in wind and solar and other renewable energies, $88 billion last year compared to the United States' $58 billion. It plans to invest another $361 billion dollars in renewable energy by 2020, creating 13 million new jobs. So that is the story that Trump is missing, that the renewable energy industry is where to go if you want to create new jobs. 

Has he -- when you look at his decisions, is it likely that he will pull out of the Paris agreement? 

Well, there seems to be an internal debate. 

Right. 

Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State, among others, has said it's probably best if the U.S. keeps a seat at the table. 

Not only that, Exxon Mobile, the company that he headed has made that point very clear. 

Yes. And a whole slew of U.S. companies have also made that point, and the insurance business and so forth, understand that the U.S. has to take a leading role in moving forward on climate. 

What happens to Paris if the U.S. should pull out? 

If Paris -- if Trump announces that he wants to step back from the Paris agreement, it's going to take several years, probably until the end of his administration. But it's clear to us that many, many countries are going to move ahead despite what the U.S. does. In fact, at least, I don't know, a dozen countries have joined the Paris agreement since Trump was elected. And China has made it clear that they, as a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, they're going to carry ahead with their commitments no matter what the U.S. does. 

Will they move to the forefront of being the most rapid developer of alternative sources of energy and at the same time being the leader of the sort of effort to do something about climate control on a global basis? 

Well, that's right. There are two aspects to that. One is cutting down China's reliance on coal, which is the leading source of its CO2 emissions, and its air pollution. At the National People's Congress Session earlier this month, China -- the Premiere announced that cutting back on China's excess coal capacity is a national priority. So China is doing it in a whole range of ways including cutting back on 280 million tons of excess coal mining capacity and new permitting for coal plants dropped 85 percent last year. China has put a cap on coal. So that's 58 percent of its total energy mix by 2020. So that is one half of it. 

So clearly they -- because of the size of who they are and what they do, the idea of leadership is thrust upon them. Is it something that they want to own? Do they want to be the leader? 

Yes, they do. On climate change, there's a whole slew of reasons why they are acting on climate now. One is their own studies, scientific studies show that China is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Sea level rise of its coastal cities, very highly populated. It feeds 22 percent of the world's population on 70 percent of its arable land and food production is already going down. And air pollution is a key problem, it's one of the worst in the world, 366 million people die every year from air pollution. And so China also sees acting on climate in its economic interest, it is in the midst of a fundamental transformation of its economic system, to one that is reliant on coal-fired heavy industry to one that is reliant more on the service sector. 

It is also moving from an exporting economy to a domestic consumption economy. 

Yes, that's right. And it recognizes that it has to deal with its massive overcapacity in coal plants. It was building two to three coal plants a week at one point. But now these plants are not even running half of the time. If China doesn't get rid of that overcapacity, it faces up to one trillion dollars in economic losses from stranded assets. 

How much of it in technology and how much of innovation in alternative fuels is taking place in the United States? 

So the United States has always been a leader in the development of the technology, kind of the brains behind the technology development. And that can still go on if the Trump administration continues to fund research and development on those. What China has done is take that, and through economies of scale, take the lead in manufacturing. Even though there are still, as I said before, many, many jobs in the United States in solar industry. But that is where, you know, the U.S. and China have something called the Clean Energy Research Center where the two countries have put their best scientists together to jointly develop new technology on things like electric vehicles, carbon capture and sequestration, building energy efficiency, and have signed agreements to share the intellectual property. That is the way to move ahead. 

So can you argue, the question is, whether the United States is prepared under the present administration to be a global leader in alternative fuels and other aspects of that, and therefore lead what is considered one of the new emerging industries of our time? 

You know, the U.S. can lead. And if Trump wants to, he can use funding to retrain the workers in the coal industry. It's a dying industry. Not because of Obama's environmental regulations, but because of the increasingly cheap natural gas and renewable energy in the United States. He can use that funding to help retrain these workers, to fund R&D for new technologies of the future, and in that way, continue to assert its leadership. We are competitive in all of these industries at this moment. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thank you so much. 

Pleasure to have you here. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
