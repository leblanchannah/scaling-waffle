Good evening. I'm Anthony Mason filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with politics. President Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. The signature legislation of President Obama's eight years in office. On Monday, the Trump administration and house Republicans unveiled their plan to upend Obamacare. The bill seeks to eliminate the individual mandate for most Americans in favor of a new system of tax credits to attract people to buy insurance on the open market among other provisions. But the legislation faces stout resistance across the political spectrum including from within the Republican Party. Joining me now from Washington is Jake Sherman. He is a senior writer for POLITICO and coauthor of Playbook. Jake, welcome. 

Thanks for having me. 

To start with, Jake, the American Health Care Act is different fundamentally how from Obamacare? 

In many, many, many ways. As you mentioned at the top, it eliminates the mandate to buy health insurance. It eliminates a whole host of provisions that Democrats worked very hard to pass. And Republicans would argue this is a free market solution. But this is kind of where the divide is here. Republicans on Capitol Hill are positioning this as the largest entitlement program in perhaps American history, which is one of the big stumbling blocks, one of the big hurdles that Donald Trump and Paul Ryan need to overcome. And from a policy perspective, though, it does keep the main structure, the main framework of Obamacare, or the ACA, as it's officially called. And the "Wall Street Journal" editorial page actually conceded this in a very friendly forum for house Republicans, a forum that frequently supports what house Republicans and senate Republicans do. Said, they are not looking to tear up the American health-care system, which is something conservatives have seized on on Capitol Hill in expressing their opposition. 

Some of the opposition is calling it Obamacare Lite, correct, the Republicans. 

Right. That's right. And this is mostly coming from the House Freedom Caucus which is a group of 25 or so conservative lawmakers, many of them the same people that got John Boehner, that forced John Boehner to resign just a couple of years ago. A lot of these people though come from districts that are extremely supportive of Donald Trump. So the real big question here from a political point of view is what does Donald Trump do to break the fever? Republicans don't have a huge margin for error in passing this bill in either the house or the senate. And so will Donald Trump hit the campaign trail aggressively to rile up in favor, these lawmakers' constituents, in favor of the health care law. Now he's doing that on Saturday, he's traveling to Louisville, Kentucky, most notably, Senator Rand Paul is against this piece of legislation. We'll see how Donald Trump positions himself and positions the legislation in front of Rand Paul's constituents. 

Paul Ryan says he has the votes to pass this in the house. Is he right? 

He might be at some point. I don't believe even he -- I don't believe even he knows it at this point. I think it's very early. And one thing that we've kind of seen and it's become a continuing narrative of Donald Trump's administration, he is basically saying that he wants to repeal and replace the health care law, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and rewrite the entire tax code by the end of July. Now this is -- I've been covering Washington, covering congress for a decade. This is something that even the biggest optimists would say is a very rosy view of how Washington works. We have 60-something legislative days. In the 1980's, it took almost, I think, a little bit more than a year to rewrite the tax code and that was without Twitter and the cable news that we know today. So, I think that this situation that Paul Ryan is describing is probably going to be right at some point, but I don't think that his leadership knows right now whether they have the votes to pass this. I think he's projecting a little bit. 

Did the Trump administration anticipate the backlash or at least the level of backlash from within the party? 

It's difficult to know because many of the people Donald Trump surrounds himself with have no experience in government. His -- Steven Bannon was a media executive; Gary Cohn was the president of Goldman Sachs; his chief policy advisor, Stephen Miller, was most recently a communications aide on Capitol Hill, hardly somebody who is very seasoned in passing legislation or what it takes to get legislation across the finish line. So it's difficult to know if they expected it. I think on Capitol Hill the people I talked to last night, this morning, throughout the day, said that they are not surprised by the opposition from some of these outside conservative groups, the thorn in the side of Republicans in Washington. Some of these groups who kind of exist to try to purify or adhere the party to a strict ideological purity. So I think that they are not surprised at the level of outside complaints. I think some people were caught off guard because we thought we were still in the honeymoon period with Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, and clearly that honeymoon period is over. 

They're going to need some of these votes. What will they do to get them, do you think? What compromises do they have to make and how does that process proceed here? 

Well, this is the big divide between the White House and Capitol Hill Republicans. Capitol Hill Republicans say, listen, what you see is what you get. We put in a lot of work to this bill. We are not going to reopen this legislation to negotiation. Because once you do that, you really start -- it unravels. It's like a ball of yarn. Once you start pulling on it the whole thing is going to end up all over the floor. Now, the White House has signaled they're sending mixed messages. They're saying this is a working draft, let's talk. We are in game for negotiation. We are happy to horse trade. That needs to end according to Capitol Hill Republicans. Now, conservatives are being brought to the White House, the House Freedom Caucus, this conservative group, is going bowling at the White House which we'll see if they can do some, you know, bowling diplomacy. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is dining with the president. The president is really using the White House and trying to use the levers of power in a way that Barack Obama was not successful at. So whether he can make the case that, listen, the Republican Party has been promising this for years, this is what we can produce. This is what we can get the votes for. This is what we need to pass. That is what he really needs to say to congressional Republicans to get it across the finish line. 

The Democrats aren't even really in the conversation here, Jake. But this is ultimately their legacy that's being attacked. And Nancy Pelosi's legacy in particular, isn't it? 

It is. And they really don't have any power to do anything. Especially in the House of Representatives where Republicans have -- Democrats have been in the minority basically since they passed this law, I mean, this was -- most political prognosticators look at this law and say this is what cost Democrats the majority in 2010, and Republicans have had it for seven years since. They could complain, they are slowing down the hearings, the initial steps to getting this bill towards the floor. They are trying to throw up procedural hurdles in the house. None of them are going to stick. Now in the senate, Democrats have a bit more power. They are still not going to vote for this legislation, and don't really have a big formal role when it comes to this legislation's future. One thing we can say for certain in some way, shape, or form, the American health-care system is going to be different than it has been for the last couple of years. And that's an important thing for Democrats, for the future of the Democratic Party. 

Jake, one of the biggest changes was the elimination of the mandate and replacing it with a penalty if you don't maintain continuous coverage. The implications of that are not at all clear because I mean some people believe that actually that will discourage people who've lost coverage to stay out of the system, drive down the numbers which, of course, drives costs higher. Is the administration and its leadership able to sell that to their own party? 

No, and they're actually not really even trying to talk too much about the specifics. Because once you get into the specifics on this legislation or on basically reshaping and reforming the health-care system in the matter of a few months, we don't know, the Republicans have not said how many fewer people will be insured. They are not saying that -- they are not even saying that they want to insure the same level of people. They say they want to insure universal access to health care, which is much different than the way Barack Obama and Democrats talked about their legislation back in 2010, up until a couple of months ago. We don't know the cost of this bill. We don't know much about this bill. And they expect it to be on the floor in the house and in the senate before Easter, so in the next couple of weeks. And we just don't know much about it. We understand the broad contours. The American people could look at the text. I could look at the text. We all have looked at the text on Capitol Hill, but we don't know the implications and I'm not sure Republicans do either, frankly. 

And we haven't received an evaluation from the Congressional Budget Office either, the CBO Score, which usually tells you some idea of what the costs might be and/or how many people will be affected or might lose coverage. But the Republicans don't seem concerned about that? 

They are concerned about it privately because they're afraid of what it will look like for them. Sean Spicer and the White House have tried to position the CBO Score as not that important. They say it was not accurate when it came to Barack Obama's health care law. It won't be accurate for them, which if you're a Republican, that's a scary political reality. 

All right, Jake Sherman with POLITICO, thanks very much for being with us. 

Thank you. 

"The Sense of an Ending" is a new film adapted from Julian Barnes' 2011 novel of the same name. Jim Broadbent stars as a man who's forced to reevaluate his life as he looks back at some of the most crucial relationships of his youth. "Variety" writes: "The film offers a poignant commentary on how each of us attempts to make meaning of our lives." Here's a look at the trailer. (DOORBELL RINGING) 

Oh, good morning. Could you, uh, sign here please? There. 

All right. 

All right, have a nice -- day. (MUSIC) 

Dear Tony, I think it right that you should have the attached, and perhaps you'll find it an interesting, if painful, memento of long ago. 

Mrs. Ford's will describes the item as a diary. 

A diary? 

He's company with Mrs. Ford's daughter. 

Veronica. 

Hello. 

Hello, Anthony. (MUSIC) 

Veronica and I were together. 

Boyfriend and girlfriend? 

Exactly, yes. Then in my school days, I met my best friend. Tony Webster. 

I'm Adrian Finn. 

Not long after, Veronica formed a relationship with him. (MUSIC) I wrote them both a very nasty letter. 

What do you think you'll find in the diary? (MUSIC) This is horrible. 

My best friend mysteriously died. Who is to blame for this event? 

Something is certainly going on. 

What is it? What is going on? 

You're on your own now. (MUSIC) 

What you end up remembering isn't always what you actually witnessed. It was an accident! 

Legally, yes. Morally, no. 

So, what were you doing there? (MUSIC) 

We may never know the truth. (MUSIC) 

Are we going to address the fact that almost everything you've told me in the last few days, you've told me for the very first time. What really strikes me is your total inability to see what's right under your nose, such as your daughter. (MUSIC) 

How often do we tell our own life story? (MUSIC) And do we adjust, embellish, make slight cuts, and create a new reality? (MUSIC) And when everything is coming off the rails... how were we to know that our lives would entwine... forever. 

And joining me now are two of the film's stars Jim Broadbent and Michelle Dockery. I'm pleased to welcome both of you to the table. Thanks for joining us today. 

Thank you. 

Jim, let me start with you because this is a book that won the Man Booker Prize. It's a well-known novel and a highly respected one. Not, I would think, an easy novel to turn into a movie. And it features in the starring role, your part, a character who his own daughter calls, gives the nickname Mudge to -- which I love, short for curmudgeon -- not the most likable guy in the world. 

No, it's one of the things that drew me to it. He's a difficult man. And he's a rather self-centered man. And he claims he's happily divorced which doesn't really ring true. But he thinks he is. And he's living a rather selfish life with his own, in his own retirement. And his hobby of running a little camera shop. But then, this legacy comes from the mother of his lost love, first girlfriend, which throws his life into turmoil. And he actually finds out, I think through that, and we find out, that he's not as happy and as content as he claims to be. 

The film makes the point -- and you say as the narrator in the film, that we all, in the course of our lives, end up writing our own stories, and sometimes not very accurately. 

Yes, the stories we tell ourselves are the stories we told ourselves first. So they get Chinese whispers. They become more and more remote from what really happened, I think. And he's convinced himself that he's all right, but when you dig a bit deeper, it all, more is revealed. 

It's interesting because he has -- he has this little shop, this little camera shop, it's like a hole in the wall. I actually love that little space, although I can't imagine how you would spend the whole day there. But it's almost like a metaphor for his life. There is one customer that comes in and he kind of scurries him out. And apart from his ex-wife who sort of prods him, the only real relationship he has is with his daughter, Michelle. 

Yes. 

But we don't actually know a lot about you in the film. 

We don't, and I love that. That Susie is -- it's a bit of a mystery, you know. Who is the father of this child that she is about to have? And I love that about the film, that there are certain things within it that are unanswered. Which it leaves the audience, you know, it's for the audience to decide, you know. But they are both at a point in their lives, I think, you know, where things are about to change quite drastically. I mean certainly for Susie, but also for Tony. You know, he's about to become the grandfather, and Margaret. And I think that it's, you know, whether it is sort of consciously in there, you know, whether Nick Payne and you know, the producers actually kind of put it in there that she was expecting a child, I mean, it's very different from the book because, of course, she's married with two children. But it kind of all builds to that point, doesn't it, toward the end. And, of course, this discovery and this journey that he goes on to unravel the past and the truth, it builds to this moment which then connects them as a family. 

Right. 

In a very -- in a different way than before, you know. 

There is a moment almost when he becomes -- when Tony becomes like a different person. I mean, it all suddenly opens up for him. 

Yes. It's beautifully constructed in Julian Barnes' novel and is taken into the film as well. The balance of the school days of being a school boy, and then the adults, but the school days and the history lessons, particularly, and I identified with the school completely. I identified with Tony Webster from the word go, we're exactly the same age, exactly the same cultural background, all boys school, formed a bit of a clique of four or five of us who thought we were cleverer than anyone else, all that fairly unpleasant school boy behavior. And it transpires, really, when older Tony's life gets thrown into turmoil, that he hasn't changed much. He hasn't -- he's got older, but he perhaps hasn't grown up, hasn't really matured. He's still the slightly lost child, boy trying to find love and stumbling and tripping over people and being rather unpleasant and rude. And I love the fact that as adults, we don't actually know everything, and that we're still struggling with life. 

One of the things I was struck by in watching this film, and I'm often struck by watching British films or TV series, is that they're unafraid to go more slowly through a story, and to let you feel it more. 

Yes. 

I mean I don't know if you notice that as actors in making films. 

Certainly in this one. 

Certainly this one, yes, yes. 

Ritesh allowed a lot of time. He's a very patient man anyway, but he also has a patience, I think, with making the film, he allows us to take our time. 

Does that change the acting experience? 

I mean, I certainly felt very relaxed on set, you know, from the get-go. It just felt like a very calm, just being allowed to kind of breathe, actually. And you feel that when you're watching it. The first time I watched the film, I thought, it's so wonderful to watch a film where there are moments of, where you can kind of take a breath, where it all kind of slows down. 

Sometimes almost nothing happens, but something is happening in that nothingness. 

Exactly. And also it allows the audience to form their own opinion of that moment. 

Sometimes I worry we've become so -- we're so worried we're going to lose people's attention that we're, we're afraid to even just stop and let something pause for a moment. 

I think that's a very good point. I was completely in it when I watched it. And actually on the page it felt very -- because, of course, you're jumping from the past to present. There were moments I thought how are they going to do this. And even if in the theatrical trailer, how they kind of split the screen, the editing is just amazing. And you never once kind of go, oh, hold on a second, where are we? Which world are we in? It's very, very clear, and yet on the page, it's quite a complicated plot in a way. 

Yes. I'm struck in having the two of you here that you are known, or you have become known in such a different fashion through your careers. You're known because of one part, Lady Mary, which everybody knows you as. And Jim, you've never really had one part that defined you. 

No, there has been one. 

I don't know what is the better course for an actor. 

Certainly, Michelle's is best for her. (LAUGHTER) 

It's worked really well both ways. 

Yes. 

I mean, you did have one extraordinary year, I mean, in 2001, where you won the Oscar, you won for "Iris," you've won the BAFTA, the British Film Award for "Moulin Rouge!" And you also were in "Bridget Jones's Diary." Did that effectively change your life that year? 

I suppose it did, yes. And I think the beginning of that process was the film "Topsy-Turvy," that was the first time I got an award. 

The Gilbert and Sullivan film. 

Yes, I played Gilbert. And that was the first time I got an award. And after that you're sort of awardable, after you get one. That was in Venice. All right, we are allowed to award him. 

Is it true? (LAUGHTER) 

That was a wonderful spread. And then "Gangs of New York" wasn't far after that. 

Yes. 

So that was, that all came together. But I think the, probably if there is one job that really changed how I was perceived, I think it might have been getting a part in Woody Allen's "Bullets over Broadway" because that was at that time, for a Brit actor to be in a Woody Allen film was very unusual. And it was so exciting to -- oh, Woody Allen likes him, that was a door opening, a job opening. 

The success of "Downton Abby" was -- did it take you by surprise? 

It did. And nothing can prepare you for that. I mean, we all felt we were on to something exciting. And it was a script that, you know, friends of mine had heard about and were reading for. And, of course, it was Julian, and Hugh had already been cast, and Maggie, so it was exciting from the very start. But you never, you can never predict how an audience will take it. 

It just seemed to build, it kept building. 

Yes. And then, of course, when it hit America, everything changed. And that seemed to be -- 

What changed? 

-- overnight. Well, I mean for me it was being suddenly recognized and, you know, that was a huge change for me. 

What is that feeling like? 

Well, it's amazing and terrifying at the same time. 

Sure. 

But it really depends where, to me, it depends where I am, it still does now. I mean, I can go completely unnoticed in some parts of the world or the country, and it all depends on like when the show is airing, you know, obviously, we're recognized more. But it's not something I would ever complain about because it has brought, you know, so much, you know, to my life, and my career going forward. And has opened so many doors, and they don't come along very often -- 

That's true. I think some people don't realize it at the time you think you're going to have another one and you don't always. 

I never take that for granted. 

Was it -- you spent six years in the end. 

Six years, yes. 

Which is a long time. 

Yes, it is. And we became like family. And, of course, you are living your life alongside, you know, you lived with the character. And your life is going alongside it. And things change for people and -- 

Did you have enough time to prepare for the ending of something like that, or is there a sort of -- 

It's funny because I did this film right after "Downton," and the title, "The Sense of an Ending." 

Oh wow. 

Yes, it was a month later, we wrapped on "Downton" and then I started this. Yes, I mean anticipation building up to those last few weeks, you know, we were devastated to let it go. But it felt like the right time. 

Yes. I get the sense that both of you always wanted to be actors, yes? 

I did really, and it took a while to own up to it. I went to art school for a year but then I realized that wasn't what I wanted to do. If I was honest with myself, I really wanted to act. So I knew really, yes. 

You did. 

Yes, I did too. I knew very young. 

You went to drama school, didn't you? 

I did, yes. And I went to a stage school, a local stage school from the age of five. And it was, you know, a hobby that my parents found for us, me and my sisters, for our confidence and to make friends, you know, other friends outside of school. 

Did it work? 

It did. And so, I was dance -- I was dancing and singing, it was more sort of a musical theater route that I could have gone down. 

Yes. 

But when I was 16, I had an encouraging drama teacher when I was doing my GCSE's around 16. And she really encouraged me, in fact, she wrote all my applications for drama school. And then that was it, I went to drama school and I knew I was hooked. 

You get into it drama school, you think I'm home. 

Yes. 

This is the world I want to be in. 

I think being part of an ensemble in a group of actors. 

And everybody loves what you love. 

Yes, that was it. I knew I was home. 

Would you ever do Broadway? 

I would. I'd love to. 

Would you? 

Yes, I'm actually dying to get back on stage because it's been five years. 

You played Eliza Doolittle, but not in "My Fair Lady," in "Pygmalion." 

Yes. 

They're casting a new "My Fair Lady" at Lincoln Center, if you're interested. 

I'll give my agent a call. I would, yes, I'm itching to get back. 

Yes. 

And so, yes. 

And you've done a lot of theater too, Jim. 

I did. I did a tremendous amount to start with. And I made a decision not to do theater until I got used to cameras. Until I wasn't frightened by the camera. 

Were you initially frightened by it? 

Yes. 

I was the same. 

I thought I've got to do enough, so I forget about it. And that sort of led into doing more and more films. And now theater's been more sporadic. But I did "Scrooge" Christmas before last. I mean, you have to keep it going, or it'll get a bit rusty. 

They feel so different to me, I've always -- 

They are. And I felt the same. I felt like I did theater for a long time before "Downton" and had done a few, you know, TV, small TV roles. But it was, I found it very intimidating at first, you know, the cameras and the crew. And because I had spent so long doing theater, so I feel like I'm at that point now where I'm used to it. 

When did you figure out how to carve up a roll into very small little parts that you did over the course of three months of shooting as opposed to one night in a performance? Because that is what I always marvel at. How you come in and out of character so quickly in between all that chaos around you. 

It took getting used to for me. I am going from theater to television, I found it, because of course for three hours, you're playing the character, you know, constantly, and you are only nipping on and off stage for a change or whatever. But having those hours in between, I found that I have gotten used to it now. But I do find it hard and kind of having less control, actually. Because when you are on stage, you have the control. But anything can happen on a set. 

When you are filming, the easiest bit is when the camera is going and you are filming and you have got something to do. And that's why you are there. And all you have to do is make it sound as real as possible and get in character and make it sound natural and real. But there is so much hanging around, a lot of -- the boredom can really do your head in, really. 

Yes. 

You can go in for a whole day and not be used because of the things that have gone wrong technically. 

Yes. 

And you have to -- that is the challenge. Keeping that patience and -- 

And keeping that energy. Like even though you have, if someone, you know, comes over and says I'm sorry, but you are not going to be used for another four hours, I find it difficult, you know, read a book or watch the TV or have a nap because I need to keep up that energy. 

Right. Good luck to you both. Michelle Dockery, Jim Broadbent, thanks for being here. The film is "The Sense of an Ending." It opens in theaters March 10th. 

Good evening. I'm Dan Senor, filling in for Charlie Rose. This week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote on President Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel. Questions abound about the future of U.S. policy in the Middle East, the future of the peace process, and the changing dynamics of Israel and the region. My two guests tonight have each recently made new contributions to the timeless discussion about the history of Israel. Shimon Dotan who teaches at New York University is an award-winning Israeli film director, screenwriter, and producer. His newest film, "The Settlers," premiered at Sundance in the New York Film Festival and is in theaters now. Daniel Gordis teaches at Shalem College in Jerusalem and is author of "Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn" which won the Book of the Year from the National Jewish Book Awards. I thank you both for being at this table. Shimon, let me start with you. A movie about the settlements. It's a perplexing problem, the settlements, that have been around for a while. Why now? Why did you choose to do this now? 

Now is as good as ever. But especially now because I find it is constantly at the center of discussions whenever anybody talks about Israel and the region. And in many cases, the conversation is misinformed. And I thought I would embark on a project that would present the history of the settlements, the ideological and religious elements that drove it, and the reality on the ground today. And I hope the document that is on the screen is a proper representation of this reality. 

Daniel Gordis, your book, "Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn," one could say another book about the history of Israel, what was missing from the discussion that sparked this interest in your doing another book on Israel? 

Actually there is not as many as one would think, but there are a number of others as you point out. I did it precisely because Shimon is right. Everybody is talking about the settlements which is a critical and very complicated problem. But the settlements aren't the whole story of Israel. The conversation about Israel in government, on college campuses, where people live, has become really conflict centric. People want to know, is Trump going to be good or bad for Israel? Was Obama good or bad for Israel? The Iran deal, good or bad, settlements, David Freedman, whatever the case may be, when people think about Israel, they really think about the conflict. But imagine somebody came to us and said, I don't really understand what America is about. I come from a different country. I understand it is a great republic. I know there are really profound ideas at its core, but I don't know what they are. Can you tell me a little bit about what makes America great? And then I said to that person, well, there was a war in 1776. I will skip a few. There was a war in 1812. There was a civil war between '62 and '65. First world war, second world war, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, there are others. But the point is that I haven't told the person anything about what makes this country great, I haven't told him anything about Thomas Jefferson and his dream for a new kind of republic and new kind of democracy. They haven't gotten a whiff of what is in the federalist papers, the way the founding fathers of this country wrestled with states rights and federal rights and so on and so forth. They haven't read Lincoln's addresses long before he becomes president, the Lyceum Address, for example, where he worries about the rule of the mob, or Martin Luther King's letter from the Birmingham Jail. Those are the kinds of things that you need to read in order to really understand what Israel is about. Israel is definitely mired in a conflict and the settlements are part of that conflict, they're an important part. But Israel is really a dream come true for the Jewish people and it has been an extraordinary human accomplishment. I thought it was time that somebody try to tell the story with the settlements and the conflict in the book but not to make the whole story about that. 

I want to show one clip of your film, Shimon. This is a clip of Sara Nachson who is co-founder of the Jewish settlement in Hebron, discussing treatment of the early settlers. Let's take a look. So, Shimon, do you think Sarah Nachson is representative of the settler movement at large in Israel, that they almost proudly regard themselves as obstacles to any kind of accommodation with the Palestinians? 

She definitely represents the early settlers. At a time that she was talking about, it was really a handful of settlers that got into Hebron and they forced their will, led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on the Israeli government. However, the reality today, it's much more complex and it's a completely different population. Out of the 400,000 settlers or so that are in the West Bank today, about 20 percent of them are ideologically, religiously driven and the vast majority are there for economical reasons. 

So a lot of them are very practical. 

Absolutely, yes, yes. 

And in 2005 when Israel did the disengagement from Gaza -- so -- and I know you don't -- 

August 2005. 

August 2005. So is -- the Israeli government orders the IDF to go into Gaza and forcibly remove thousands of settlers? 

Yes, 7,500. 

And what do you think that tells us about the Israeli people and their representative government's attitude towards the settlers? That if there is a possibility, one could argue, to achieve some kind of peace, that they would challenge those settlers? 

Let me put it this way. To my knowledge, there is no point in time when an Israeli government body did an analysis and the strategic evaluation of the benefits that the settlement enterprise yields to the State of Israeli. Quite a contrary, whenever somebody made something like that out of government, the result was that there is detrimental entity to the State of Israel. What happened in Gaza, it was driven, I would suggest, in good part by the fact that it just become too costly to maintain the settlements over there, and Ariel Sharon decided he had to take them out. It was -- I would say this is a proof to the fact that it's possible to remove settlements. But nevertheless, it's a proof to the fact that the government of Israel, if it has the will, it can do that. And the fact that the settlements are all over the West Bank is absolutely an act of the Israeli government. And it's too easy to vilify the settlers and say it's their doing. It's their doing -- and as she said, she wanted to be a bone in the throat of the government. But the government has to be willing to leave this bone stuck in its throat. That's how it behaved for the last 50 years almost. 

But the Israeli government took a risk. They had the will, as you said, Ariel Sharon, to pull out of Gaza. And it was an experiment. And some would argue that what Israel got following that experiment was not peaceful coexistence. But was a Hamas takeover of Gaza, and thousands of rockets being rained on Sderot and even further north from southern Israel. 

When you divorce somebody, it depends how you divorce them. Israel did not create an environment that will allow the population of Gaza to engage in any progress, vis-a-vis Israel. Quite the contrary. The siege over Gaza was strengthened, was maintained, and in the lack of any political horizon, you cannot expect anything different. I'm not in any way defending the Hamas or the Gazan government. But I do think that it is in Israel's power. It was then as it is today to change the set of the preconditions that will allow the progress throughout the political horizon. 

Daniel, could Israel have done more? 

Israel did strengthen the blockade. But Israeli strengthening the blockade is not what caused Gaza to elect Hamas. Hamas was elected pretty quickly after the disengagement. But Hamas is a mess and Gaza is a mess. There is reason that the Egyptians didn't even want it back when they were negotiating a peace treaty with Israel. The more pressing question for peace is the West Bank. And the question is really, is there a possibility of creating what most people I think still want, what I think Shimon wants, what I want, which is a two state solution. And I think what you are seeing when Shimon talks about the Israeli government being unwilling to take a stand, I think it is really the Israeli people being unwilling to take a stand because nobody knows what you are taking a stand on. You can get out of there. But the question is what fills the vacuum? Israelis are worried. They saw the experiment in 2005. I was in favor of the disengagement. I thought it was a good idea. In the end, I would have to say it was a failed idea, that it is good that we tried. Because we learned something by it. Interestingly enough, by the way, Israel's international popularity plummeted right after the disengagement. Didn't go up, as many Israelis thought it would, which is a strange kind of a thing that I don't really understand to this very day. But the question really is, there was a really very interesting comment in the clip of the movie that we just saw where the gentleman speaking before the interview says that the 500,000 settlers have turned into a monster. He uses the word, Hebrew word -- they've turned into the monster that's standing in the way of peace. I think it's interesting what is really standing in the way of peace is what is standing in the way of peace, these 500,000 settlers, which as you both acknowledge Israel could remove if it wanted to, or is what is standing in the way of peace the fact that the Palestinians on the West Bank still basically are not willing to negotiate. As recently as February 2014, John Kerry himself has said that in these very sort of private conversations happening between him and Netanyahu and Abbas, at the end of the day, Abbas just pulled the plug. He expected the United States to push through everything that the Palestinians want and because it was an Obama administration to force that on Israel. When he realized that he wasn't going to get everything that he wanted, he just basically pulled the plug on the negotiations and said, Kerry, at the end of the day, the Israelis made some accommodations in these negotiations. The Palestinians at the end didn't budge. And tragically, that's really been the bottom line story. The Palestinians have done an exceedingly good job of telling a very different tale and of weaving a different narrative. And again, it's important to state, I actually would like the Palestinians to have a state. I would like them to have a democratic state. I would like them to have a thriving economic state. I would like their kids not to have to patrol the border because of my kids and my kids not to have to patrol the border because of their kids. But in order to do that, both sides are going to have to make some very far-reaching accommodations. 

So, Shimon, when you were, go ahead. 

I disagree with you in principle. Yes, we agree on the end results. We both want the same end results. We do appreciate that the two-state is the only solution in the region. But I think that to put the blame on the Palestinian, for that matter, to put the blame on one side, is ignoring the facts on the ground. Israel is the authority in the region. The strongest power. Israel does not face any military threat whatsoever in the region. And because of that, it's its responsibility to extend a hand, to take the initiative. We have to recognize that we live now in the West Bank where the reality is 2.7, 2.8 million Palestinians, in the midst of them, more than 400,000 Israelis. Now, this reality is terrible from the standpoint of Israel, not only of the Palestinians. And to ignore that and to wait for the Palestinians to somehow appease to some of Israel's demand, I think it's quite a short sight of the phenomenon. And if Israel will not recognize that it's upon her to initiate, to extend a hand, to come up with a proposition that will be out of a position of power and stop trying to present itself as a victim in the region, it will never change. And it will last for eternity. And eternity starts to feel quite long especially as we get to the end of it. 

Eternity always felt quite long. But I think you are right in the sense that this has a much wider context. But before we go back to the context, Ehud Barak would tell you that he made a far-reaching accommodation to the Palestinians, that he did give an outreached hand, and that it was rebuffed. Ehud Olmert, subsequent prime minister, will tell you that he made a very far-reaching overture to the Palestinians and that was rebuffed. And Bill Clinton would tell that that was exactly right. You have a sort of a third party who would acknowledge that that's the case. So first of all, I don't buy the idea that Israel has never reached out. I think Israel does reach out. Now, Israel has no military threat to face in the region. That's not entirely the case obviously depending on what fills the vacuum in the West Bank. That's why Israel, for example, is insisting on a military presence along the Jordan River which the Palestinians so far are unwilling to countenance. Israel is insisting on that for exactly the same reason. It's very hard to know what comes across the Syrian border, goes down Jordan, goes across. You and I want the same thing. So let's talk for a minute about why we don't have the world that you and I both want. We both are Israelis. We both care deeply about the future of the country. We would both like the Palestinians and Israelis to live side-by-side. So really, why has this not happened? And I think here is part of the reason that I wrote the book, the book tries to explain that this conflict has a very long history. We're coming on almost a century of conflict beginning in 1929 when over the course of one weekend, Arab rioters destroyed the Jewish community of Hebron which had been in place for literally centuries. And then there was a riot later on in 1936 when the Peel Commission came from Britain. And they decided, they looked at the map, they looked at the Jews, they looked at the Arabs and said, in 1936, the Jews and the Arabs are not going to be able to live together. We have a radical idea, let's divide the land. The Jews thought they were getting all of that land plus something on the other side of the Jordan River, Peel said you are getting a small piece of what is actually even now Israel. The Zionist back then was called the Yishuv, the pre-state -- they were very unhappy, and they said yes. And the Arabs were -- let me just finish -- the Arabs were very unhappy and launched the riots of 1936, 1937. In 1947, when the U.N. Partition Commission began to discuss whether to divide it up and how to divide what the map should be, the Zionists again, the Jews who actually saw this as their national liberation movement. This wasn't about just making a state. This was about ending the tenuousness of Jewish life across the world. It was about saying, we don't want to live that way anymore. We don't want to live in England and then in 1290, when they decide they don't want anymore Jews, the Jews are gonna be gone. We don't want to live in Spain at the highest echelons of culture and philosophy and art, even pretty close to political power. And then Ferdinand Isabella in 1492 decided that the Jews can either burn at the stake, leave or convert. We don't want to be in Berlin in 1933 thinking that we have come to the ultimate home for the Jewish people and find us all basically eradicated 12 years later. I think what the Jews were saying was this was about transforming the existential condition of the Jew. And that's why somebody like Chaim Weizmann who was Israel's first president, when the Jews were debating whether or not to take this much smaller map than they hoped for, he said if it's the size of a table cloth, you take the deal. Because we need just some place to call our own. And I have to say, if somebody on the Palestinian side were to say if it is the size of a table cloth, take the deal, and obviously they've been offered much more than a table cloth. Because what we want more than anything else is to begin to establish our own national sovereign roots. My read of the history and obviously Shimon disagrees, but my read of the history is that at the end of the day, whether it was the five standing armies that attacked Israel in '47/'48, whether it was the Egyptians, the Jordanians, and the Syrians in '67 and '73, or the Palestinians much later, they just have not been willing to say once and for all the Jewish state has a right to exist. This land is our native land, but it's also the Jewish people's native land, and we ought to split it. 

Do you think it is reasonable for any Israeli government, left or right, to expect in return for a resolution of settlement policy, the territories that are clearly in dispute, that the Palestinian leadership and the Arab world recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, formally declare an end to the conflict, and understand that Israel may need to keep some security presence on the border between the West Bank and Jordan. Are those reasonable expectations? Because they seem to transcend party lines, the ideological spectrum in Israel. 

I'd say they are reasonable but they are not a precondition. There is one thing that I would say that's a precondition that we are going to resolve this issue once and forever. But the details of that should recognize Israel as a Jewish state or not, it's an Israeli matter, it is not a Palestinian matter, as they do not ask us, and I don't think it's our place to recognize them, the kind of nationality they want to call themselves. But I want to go back to what Dan mentioned. You were very eloquent and I really appreciated your comments on the virtues of remembrance and forgetting. You give a very eloquent speech on that. And I am somewhat surprised that at that standpoint when I generally do not believe that Israel is facing a military threat, we bring up memories of victimhood and make it an article in the political maneuvers that we're trying to make now. Zionism inception started as a secular movement. Herzl came with a wonderful idea to create a national state for the Jewish people, for one and only one reason, to provide safe haven to persecute the Jews. At no point in time did Zionism aspire to fulfill biblical prophesies or to hasten the arrival of the Messiah. And the main forces that brought us into the West Bank with the settlements was those two forces. And we have to recognize that. So any retreat from the West Bank or allowing the Palestinian to have their own state in the West Bank is the fulfillment of Zionism. It is not the negation of Zionism. I would suggest that the settlements in the West Bank are the negation of Zionism. 

The region seems to be changing in a way that is much different from the status quo that existed for most all of my adult life up until now. You basically have a hundred year order in the region collapsing before our eyes. You have failed states left and right. You have borders that are being erased. You have massive refugee flows that we haven't seen at any time since the fall of the Ottoman empire and possibly the end of World War II. At any given day, you have no idea what government is gonna be in power in many of these Arab countries, like even Jordan. 

Right. 

How does that reality drive the exact debate you two are having right now? Start with you, Dan. 

I don't actually think that it drives it all that much. I think that reality drives Israel's concern about Iran. I think that reality drives Israel's concern about watching its northern border very carefully where there were Russian planes and Syrian planes and Turkish planes and probably some of the -- 

ISIS potentially getting into the West Bank. 

But I don't think that's what is actually motivating this. I think that would be motivating Israel wanting a military presence along the river to try to stop this. Of course it's a concern. Every Israeli understands though, as Shimon said, we're not going to move anywhere unless we are willing to take some risks. I don't think the issue of Syria melting -- Syria melting down is a huge problem by the way because then you have hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of refugees potentially making their way into Jordan, which is desperate for Israel's help to stay stable. I mean, King Abdullah is a closet Zionist in his own way. He won't ever say that, but he knows he is in power in large measure because of that. He is afraid of Iran. And obviously, the Saudis are worried about Iran. And Egypt is worried about Iran. I mean, there is actually, as you said, a very changing map emerging in the Middle East where ironically, first of all in the war of 2014, if anybody had told you when Israel and Egypt were at war in '73, that the war in 2014, Israel's biggest ally would be Egypt, somebody would've told you, you have really got it wrong. But Egypt was actually incredibly helpful to Israel in the 2014 war. If somebody would have said one day a couple of decades ago that Israeli and Saudi officials were going to be in very, very close discussion because of Iran, they would have said that's crazy, but of course all those things are happening. But I don't think that's specifically the issue of the settlements. Yes, Israel needs a buffer and Israel needs to have the protection of the wider space. But I think that fundamentally, I was going back to the history not because of history of victimhood. Going back to the history because the history suggests what is the instinctive nature of the people with whom we have to make the deal, who so far have not been willing to recognize who and what we are. One last point about Herzl, Herzl was, it's true, in favor of Israel as a kind of a haven for Jews who needed haven. But he is not the last word on Zionism. David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, had a much more robust conception of what Zionism was gonna be. It involved bringing a language back to life, it embodied a new national culture. What the Jews have done in Israel is really to transform the Jewish people. That is what I wanted to show in this book. This is not just a bunch of people who moved from Europe or North Africa, came to Palestine and got into a war. This is a group of people who in many waves came to a new place, rebuilt an entire people, one of the grandest, most extraordinary human stories of all time, just needs the other side to recognize that we are also here to stay and put this behind us. 

We just have a minute, go ahead. 

That worked quite well until 1967. I'm sure that you know quite well, probably you too, that in the war of '48, the war for independence, Yigal Allon came to Ben-Gurion and said we can take the West Bank. We can do that. It is no problem. No military problem there. And Ben-Gurion rejected that. He says, what are we going to do with 700,000 Palestinians? So now, we have 2.7 million Palestinians, we have the West Bank, and the question is exactly the same question. So the answer -- 

Is? 

The answer is a two-state solution. That's the answer. 

I think you both agree. So we're out of time. I would say that as a reflection of the health of the Israeli public debate, that you could have such -- two such talented and spirited individuals who don't exactly see eye-to-eye try to hash this out, really tells you about sort of the soul, the soul of Israel. So thank you both for being here. "The Settlers" is the film by Shimon Dotan which is out in theaters now. The book is "Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn" by Daniel Gordis. Thank you both for being at this table. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
