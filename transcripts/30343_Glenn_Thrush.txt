We continue our coverage of President Trump's first 100 days in office. In an interview with "The New York Times" earlier today, the president suggested that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice may have criminally misused classified information. The president said that Rice had broken the law by seeking the identities of Trump associates in intelligence reports of foreign officials. The president also weighed in on yesterday's chemical attack in Syria and called Putin's continuing support of the Assad government a very sad day for Russia. Joining me now is Glenn Thrush. He is chief White House political correspondent for "The New York Times". He and his colleague, Maggie Haberman, sat down with the president in the Oval Office this morning. I am pleased to have him back on the program. Welcome. 

Great to be here, Charlie. 

Set the scene for me for this interview. 

Well, we were summoned to the Oval Office around 11:00 AM. It was a beautiful day here in Washington, D.C., and what was really interesting is, of course, the power map of the White House can really be seen by who occupies the Oval Office. I've done a number of Oval Office interviews and there tends to be one or two aides standing around the periphery, but this was like Grand Central Station at rush hour. 

Yes. 

There were four chairs set up, to my left was sitting the head of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, and to my colleague Maggie Haberman's right was Hope Hicks, and through the course of the interview, all of these various luminaries wandered in and out. Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, even Vice President Mike Pence, and a rotating cast of characters that I think probably added up to 12 or 15 people. It was just another illustration of the fact that proximity is power in the Trump White House, and people really want to be around him. 

Did the interview timing simply come out of the blue or had you been asking and they said, well, it will be some time on this day? 

Well, one of the things that Maggie and I wanted to do, particularly in the wake of the healthcare debacle, was to talk to him about infrastructure, which really seems to be, and is crystallizing I think in the White House and also in certain precincts on Capitol Hill, as being potentially his salvation in terms of gaining a win, moving into a more bipartisan phase of his presidency, and something that is much -- that is quite close to the heart of a lot of people who voted for him in the industrial Midwest. And, you know, to our surprise he took us up on that offer. But the funny thing, Charlie, is we went in with a list of questions about infrastructure and immediately, unprovoked, he hit us with the Susan Rice stuff, and we asked him -- he essentially claimed that it's going to be one of the biggest stories in the world. We hit him up immediately for evidence of this. He provided none. He then said there were other members of the Obama administration who had done similar things. We said, can you name those folks? He said, perhaps at a later date. So it's sort of the typical, the typical Trump technique in terms of diverting attention, and also attempting to make mainstream media outlets like "The New York Times" cover the Susan Rice story more vigorously. 

So what is it exactly that the president thinks that Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor for President Obama, did? 

Well, I think, basically, he thinks that, you know, her behavior is the smoking gun in his Tweet from a month ago, that she was one of the people who coordinated the, wiretapping against him. Essentially, what she's been accused of, and we should say this isn't just the president, Sean Spicer, the press secretary for the White House, said it, a bunch of other Republicans on the Hill allied with President Trump had said it, is the she unmasked members of the Trump campaign during the transition who were under surveillance. It should be said that Ambassador Rice has categorically denied this, and senior intelligence officials say it's extremely unlikely this was part of a series of systematic surveillance that was conducted by the Obama administration against the Trump campaign, but it is, obviously, I think from press reports, something that is worth pursuing. 

OK, so here's what my question about all that, because we had former deputy director and acting director of the CIA Michael Morell here talking about how unmasking takes place, and he said to me that certain people of a high rank can request when they see a conversation, a conversation with some foreign official that's being followed or wiretapped or whatever, they -- and the person who is the American is only identified as person 1, person 2, person 3, they can ask that they be unmasked. Now, and it goes through a procedure. To ask that something be unmasked simply because you don't know who it is is very different than going on with what the president has called a witch-hunt for people, is it not? 

Absolutely. And we should say, you know, again, that the president offered no evidence that Susan Rice or anybody else associated with the administration leaked any of this. There is no evidence of that. And Ambassador Rice and other senior administration officials have denied doing so. I guess time will tell as to who is right. But, look, Charlie, this is smart tactically. 

Right. 

As crazy as that might sound. They need to muddy the water in terms of the narrative on this, to change the conversation, which has really, really dominated this presidency for a month. You know, it's a self-inflicted wound that the president inflicted on himself. So from a short-term tactical perspective, why not try to blame the Obama administration? We'll see if it turns out to be true. We're hearing, as you said, that it's quite unlikely that it is. 

And suppose it turns out that in fact it is not true, can he claim that he had reason to believe it might be true? 

Yes, as he always does. Look, you know, I've had conversations with White House officials over the last couple of days. They've been increasingly candid about their concern about the information flow to the president. That is a dominant issue here. Now, part of that was actually solved, ironically, by the elimination of the masked man or the unmasked man, General Flynn at NCS. The current National Security Advisor, General McMaster has a much better reputation and much more professional approach to presenting data to the president. But, look, there are a lot of people who are waking in and out the Oval Office, and I was there today, you can literally see them walking in and out of the Oval Office presenting the president with papers and information. Trying to be a gatekeeper for this guy is an absolute nightmare. So he is getting all kinds of un-vetted information. So who knows where he is getting this. He wouldn't tell us. We asked him if he'd gotten new intelligence on this, he refused to talk about it. Again, all we got out of him was a vague promise in the future for him to disclose that there were other people involved and that there was new information that was going to come out. 

Is there anything new to add to the story of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee? 

Interestingly, he didn't talk about that. The one person he brought up completely unprompted was Bill O'Reilly from Fox News, who of course, it has been disclosed over the last couple of days, our paper did a story on it, has paid off something like $13 million in settlements to women who accused him of inappropriate behavior. And really almost unprompted he came to Mr. O'Reilly's defense, said he thought he hadn't done anything wrong, and he said that he wouldn't have paid out any of those settlements and that he would have gone to law. 

And he said he did that because he thought Bill O'Reilly was a good person and knew him, and he liked him, and all of that? 

Exactly, yes. I mean, the interesting thing, Charlie, you know, again, we came into this office loaded forebear to talk about the details of infrastructure, and when we did ask him specific questions about it, for instance, a really big, two really big questions are, what percentage of this trillion dollar infrastructure plan is going to be direct subsidies to localities versus tax credits, Democrats say if it's too many tax credits they're not going to go for it. We got no new information on that. He was not prepared to divulge details. And then another very significant thing is the Davis-Bacon Act, Republicans want it stripped from infrastructure. Davis-Bacon, essentially, mandates that people with contracts are allowed to unionize. Democrats again say that's a nonstarter. Again, he punted on that and said he would have a statement on that in two weeks. So, we went in wanting to talk about infrastructure, but it was very, very clear that the president wanted to talk about Susan Rice and O'Reilly. 

And with respect to Susan Rice, not only did he want to talk about it, but suggested that she might have broken the law and might be vulnerable to going to jail. 

Yes, and the other thing that's really interesting is the aides who were in the Oval Office very clearly didn't want him to talk about that. So at several points in time, a couple of fascinating things happened, Hope Hicks, who is very close to the president -- I don't think people fully understand the extent to which she is an important and respected advisor in the president's circle -- at some point during this interview attempted to steer the conversation back to infrastructure, not so much because we as reporters were pushing it, but because the president wanted to talk about it. And in one extraordinary moment when my colleague Maggie Haberman asked the president how much time he was spending on infrastructure, Gary Cohn, you know, the most powerful economic advisor in the president's midst said, hey, wait a second, Mr. President, you know, let's talk about trade and taxes, which we're spending a lot of time on. So it was a fascinating sort of real-life, real-time interaction with the president that exhibited so many of his strengths and, you know, some of his weakness in terms of staying on task. 

I was also struck by the fact that when he got to Syria, he also not only did he express outrage at what had taken place and how bad this was for the Russians to be engaged by this with Assad, he also took time to blame the Obama administration for what they had done after the red line was announced and then they decided not to go forward because they had made a deal to get all of the chemical weapons taken out of Syria. 

Right. And that was the dynamic that he really wanted to bring up. So those were the talking points that the administration has had. They put out a statement yesterday in the wake of these horrific images, I mean, some of the -- 

Right. 

I had to walk away from a screen today when I was looking at that. I have small kids. I don't want to see that, right? 

Right. 

And I think, you know, in the statement yesterday, the White House blamed the Obama administration, which is sort of stunning, so the president started to talk about that, and obviously we weren't going to interrupt him, it was the position he wanted to say, but we kept pressing him on the Russia question, and he said I think initially that he thought it was a dark day, a sad day for Russia, admitting that Russia and Assad are allied. And when we pressed him again, the most that he would say was that he was very disappointed in Vladimir Putin. And tellingly, he refused to say if this was one of those issues that he thought rose to the level of him making a personal phone call to Mr. Putin. 

Thank you for coming, Glenn. 

Take care, Charlie. 

We'll be right back, stay with us.
