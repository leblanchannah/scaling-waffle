Back in a moment. 

Joining us now to discuss the politics of homeless shelters and what really went wrong with Mayor Dinkins' fair share plan. Our New York Post columnist, Jack Newfield and city councilperson, Ronnie Eldridge. Welcome. In the time that we have, let me just rate, is the mayor's plan dead simply because you got the Cuomo commission now, which it's going to release its report, and some are saying that ... 

I don't think there's any one answer to this problem. As you can see, everybody's got a different view, and it's an enormous problem. We've only actually been talking about one segment of it which is homeless single adults. The mayor's plan it seemed to me was something put on the table to start discussion. At least that's how I looked at it. I think it's the way it's been received and then the way it's been opposed, or the way it's been interpreted. I don't think the mayor's plan never said, these are the sites. It did say, we believe in this fair share principle, which is that all communities have to share in the taking of the facilities. 

How many shelters they got depended on how they ... how many ... 

What they had as far as residential beds, offering of the services. Right. It said, "We're suggesting these sites. You come back to us in 90 days and tell us whether your community likes these sites, or do you have alternative plans or proposals?" It didn't say the city was going to run the shelters at all. In the community that I represent, we have one proposed shelter site. It happens to be a site that some people think would be viable and other people don't want it, but we're looking into it. We're visiting programs. We would never consent to having the city come in and run it. We would negotiate with them to get a voluntary agency. We would only say we want 50 people. It's a different kind of plan. It's offering small shelters. It's offering strong services, special services, and you're right. It's more or less transitional housing. It's a misnomer to call it the shelters. 

Jack, help me out. 

It wasn't a plan to begin with is really what I'm saying. 

I think the mayor made a big mistake by making only specific in his plan these 35 sites, some of which are absurd, next to public schools. The site in Norwood in the Bronx is in the middle of a shopping street. I think everything else was vague. The original survey that the plan was based on concluded that 17% of homeless adult singles are drug abusers. No expert in the world agrees with that. It was not based on testing. It was based on interviews with 202 people. The plan did not make any differentiation among different kinds of homeless people. It did not tell the communities what kind of population that they were going to get. It did not consult with the communities before the sites were put out. I think half of the sites are so idiotic and failed to take into account the fragility and importance of these working class neighborhoods in the city. People overreacted. They city council held hearings which were needlessly divisive. I think everyone fell into a trap that was set by the incompetence of Dinkins' plan. 

I don't want to defend the mayor and the mayor's plan. 

Defend the city council. 

I don't. I never defend the city council. At one point they said borough presidents, "We need to have smaller shelters. We need additional sites. Makes some suggestions." 

Everybody agrees that's a good idea. Don't they? 

Absolutely. 

Jack? 

20 years ago- 

Yes. 

20 years ago- 

No. 

No, you don't agree smaller shelters is a good idea? 

Not shelters. Let's not call them shelters. 

I disagree with the whole concept that the city is responsible for every person who comes into New York. The mayor buckled under. It was Mayor Koch. When he was taken to court and the judge said, "You have to house every person." Now, that is communism, and you know what happened in eastern Europe. 

In the neighborhood I represent, it's not communism. I think it's sensible. You talk about real estate properties. 

No, it's not, Ronnie. 

The people in the district I represent want the people off the streets. They want the people off the streets and into some kind of programs that are going to change lives. 

Why does the city have to do it? 

Who's going to do it? 

Who else is going to do it? 

Who's going to do it? Number one, they cam from somewhere. They can go somewhere else and try to find work. 

Some other city. 

Number two some other city, some other town. 

... some of the people do work that live in the shelter. First of all, the problem is not the homeless. The problem is decent, affordable housing. 

I never said that some people didn't work, Sharletta, but you know. 

The homeless have been vilified and to be criminals. 

Hold on. 

I don't think the problem is decent housing for everybody. I think the problem is we used to have lots of SROs, call them single room occupancy facilities. 

I agree. 

There were boarding houses. 

Absolutely. 

They were brownstones or tenements where a person rented out rooms and served meals. We don't have those facilities anymore because urban renewal, development in communities has replaced those facilities. 

Jack- 

We need places for people who don't want their own apartments. 

--about the plan is I think there are a lot of decent sites that are not in the middle of working class and middle class neighborhoods. There's Wards Island, Heart Island. Bryan Psychiatric Hospital has 114 acres. There's land in Suffolk and Rockland counties that's much cheaper than land. 

Let me just ask a naive question. It doesn't take a political sophisticate to know that if you talk about creating homes for the homeless in certain communities, you're going to create problems with certain taxpayers, with people in the community unless it's thought out, unless it's very carefully handled. I mean, that's obvious. 

A lot of these neighborhoods have accepted homeless shelters without this kind of fear and hysteria. If the communities are respected and consulted and involved in a decision- 

The problem here was the absence of consultation. 

You can't go to a computer and do this by census tracks and computer runs without taking common sense into the math. 

Jack, it wasn't just the presenter of the plan. It was as you said the way it was accepted. It seemed to me- 

The way it dribbled out. 60 sites, 20 sites here on Staten Island. 

This was to begin. It came out without talking to anybody. 

I resent people saying NIMBY. Anytime you say you don't want something in your neighborhood, people say, "Not in my backyard." Let me tell you something. These people work very hard for their backyard. I worked for mine for a certain quality of life, and I resent people saying that you don't have any compassion because you want a certain quality of life. 

I agree with you. I think everybody feels that way. The property owners on the west side of Manhattan feel the same way. The problem is we do have a problem. We have a lot of people who need some kind of drug treatment programs, or they need facilities for mentally ill. 

I agree with that. 

They need daycare programs. 

I agree with that. 

Councilperson. I want to give you the last word. I got 20 seconds. 

Number one issue is that the homeless are not criminals. They have bene characterized as criminals, as drug addicts, as unworthy and undeserving of help. The number one issue is there is not enough affordable units whether they be SROs or apartments, what have you. There is not enough decent, affordable housing. The homeless must have and we demand to have a seat on the policy making boards. How can you have a policy on homelessness to cure the problem when you do not consult the people? 

That's not a bad idea. Is it? Thank you all. I am unfortunately out of time. I want to thank all of tonight's guests.
