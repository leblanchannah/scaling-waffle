Kate Winslet is here. She is a four-time Oscar nominee with four films in theaters this fall. Two of the films, "All the King`s Men" and "Little Children," are in theaters now. Here is a look at those films. 

How is your wife? I`m sorry. I have forgotten her name. 

That didn`t quite work out as I had hoped. A lot of tangled bed clothes and unspoken loathing and spoken loathing and no tangled bed clothes. Didn`t I read of your engagement in the society column? Which, you know, I always turn to first in the paper. 

I was engaged, more than once. I didn`t care for any of them. But why that should matter, I don`t know. 

Who needs them anyway. 

So how was your weekend? 

You really want to know? It sucked. How was yours? 

Terrible. 

Really? 

Yes. Yes. We went to the beach. And all Kathy and I did was argue the whole time. 

You did? 

Yes, it was our annual argument over taking the bar exam, like our whole life depends on it. 

Get it over with. You`ll feel better. 

That`s the whole thing. Got to take a train on Wednesday. And it`s a two-day ordeal. I`m not even going to pass. 

You`ll be fine. 

No, I won`t. I haven`t cracked a book all summer. 

Later this fall, she will lend her voice to the animated "Flushed Away." She`ll also appear in the romantic comedy "The Holiday," with Jack Black. I am pleased to have her back at this table. Welcome back. 

Thank you very much. 

Also, Jude Law is in-- 

Jude Law is in "The Holiday" also. He plays my brother. Yes, he does. 

Where do I start? How are you? 

I`m very well. I`m very, very well indeed. 

Your wonderful husband, Sam Mendes, has a great play coming up that everybody in New York can`t wait to see. 

He does. He does. 

Bill Nighy in--. 

David Hare`s "The Vertical Hour," Bill Nighy and Julianne Moore. And yes, we`re very well. Very well. 

You`re working hard, or you have been working hard with all these films coming out. 

Yes. It`s sort of -- I suppose it does look like I`ve been, you know, insanely ambitious and working a lot in the last few years. But the truth is, everything that`s coming out in this four-month period of time is pretty much everything I`ve done since my son was born, and he`s nearly 3 now. So it`s just coming out now. You know? And as actors, you have no control over any of that. You have no say whatsoever. But you know, the nice thing is that, particularly with "Little Children," I love the film so much. It`s such a pleasure to sort of talk about it and find something new to say about it all the time. 

You`re talking about this one. 

I`m talking about "Little Children," yes. 

We talked to Todd Field, your director. 

Yes. 

Tell me about your character. Sarah. 

Well, I play Sarah. Sarah is a very intelligent woman. She is a woman who was a feminist when she was younger. She`s very feisty. You imagine that if she weren`t leading the life she`s leading, that she would have probably been some great philosopher or adventurer of some kind. But that`s not what`s happened to her life. She`s living in suburbia. She doesn`t quite know how she`s ended up living there. She`s married to a man she doesn`t really know why she married him. She`s not in love with him anymore. 

No one knows why she married him, when you see the film. 

No one knows why she married him, but I think it was just a moment of extreme loneliness and weakness on her part. And she has a small child, a three-year-old daughter, who -- she doesn`t have a particular connection with this child. She`s not a very good parent. She doesn`t really know how to be a mother. So what you have is a woman who has ended up living a life that she just did not plan for herself at all. And she`s incredibly unhappy, and having to sort of mask that and cover that up just in order to survive and get through every day. She`s extremely trapped and lonely and is wanting to break free and wants something more in her life. And she finds it in Brad, played by Patrick Wilson. 

More about Brad in a moment. Do you think there are a lot of women like this? Do you know a lot of women like this? 

I do know women like this. 

Who somehow have all this talent, and are interesting and smart. And many of them are sort of in love with the idea of their children and being the greatest parent they can be. Others like you, find a way to do both of it. Then you have a feeling that there are some, like this character, Sarah, who somehow is in conflict because of it and can`t find a way to make it all work. 

Well, I think she`s, you know, she`s lost control of her life and herself and who she is. She can`t remember who she once was. And she`s desperately trying to get back to that person, but she`s forgotten who that person was in the first place. And I think the truth is, I do know women like this. And I overhear conversations in the playground myself very similar to the conversations that you hear in this movie, in the playground by the swing set, with the other mothers. And, you know, it was difficult to play somebody who on the surface is nothing like me, but in actual fact, through shooting this film and playing this character and understanding who she was, I think I realized that the natural fact, there is so much of her that has been me at various different times of my life. You know, Sarah is very much the, you know, she`s not necessarily a beauty. She doesn`t have particularly good dress sense. She has absolutely terrible hair, so on and so forth. And she`s the kind of girl who didn`t get asked to dance at the prom. You know, and the truth is, I was like that. I never, you know, I never got the boys. I was never thought of as pretty or attractive or anything like that. You know, was nervous of life in many ways. And I think that`s a lot of Sarah, too. And so it was just interesting in terms of building who she was and the preparation that I was doing for myself. I kept coming up with things where I would go, OK, I might not like to admit this, but in actual fact, yes, I`ve been there, I`ve been that person. I`ve felt emotionally stifled like she feels in this film. And it was hard to sort of revisit some of that stuff in myself. 

But also good I assume because it gave you some place to access something that you could take out. 

Yes, it did in a strange way. It was kind of weirdly therapeutic, I think, even though I didn`t necessarily realize that at the time. It`s kind of only now talking about it that I kind of go, yes, OK, I got that out of my system then, maybe. So -- but it was an enormous challenge. 

When you say there was a time in which you weren`t very attractive and you didn`t have a date at the prom, a lot of people are saying oh, sure. 

Oh, no, no, I`m telling you. 

She`s just saying that. Did you actually-- 

I`m telling you, I was a very -- how do I put this. You know-- 

Ugly duckling. 

Very much an ugly duckling. 

Come on. 

No, no, I was absolutely was. And I was a very stocky child. I was quite an overweight teenager. I was quite -- I was quite shy. I didn`t -- no, I never got to go out with the cute boys. Never. And yeah, it`s true. I mean, it`s really all true. 

So what happened to change it for you? How come you got smart? 

I don`t know. I grew up. I grew up. I got brave. I started working as an actress, which I think is a huge confidence booster. You know, so much of acting is about having the confidence to really step out there and do it. You know, I think-- 

To expose yourself. 

Absolutely. And I think it`s 50 percent skill and 50 percent confidence. Otherwise, you don`t have a performance. You don`t have the courage to put yourself there to go to those extremes and play those parts. And it`s a real test of emotional strength, just to be an actress on its own, regardless of whether you`re actually getting a job or not. It`s tough. 

Do you think your life would have been very different if you hadn`t been in "Titanic?" 

I don`t know. It`s so hard to say. I mean, I definitely think that without question it opened so many doors for me in terms of opportunity and choice, you know, the freedom to choose what I do as an actress, which is such an extraordinary luxury. It really is. Because I get to play so many different roles and so many different types of people. It`s never the same, and I love that. I really do. It`s part of the challenge. And it`s part of what I love about this job. And I really do love this job more so all the time, I think. But it`s likely that my life could have been very, very different. I don`t know in what way. 

Because you got an opportunity. Lots of people who have talent and skill for whatever reason, luck, timing, it didn`t come together at the right time. 

Well, as an actor, I mean, a classic example actually is, there`s an actor in "Little Children," his name is Jackie Earl Haley, and he plays the character Ronnie, who is a convicted sex offender. And he gives the most extraordinary-- 

A terrific performance. 

-- performance. I mean, you feel nothing but incredible pain and sympathy for this man. But Jackie Earle Haley, you know, he was living a whole another life down in San Antonio, hadn`t worked as an actor for 16 years, until Steve Zaillian found him and cast him as Sugar Boy in "All the King`s Men," and then Todd Field turned to me and said, listen, what are your thoughts on Jackie Earle Haley? Didn`t you work with him on "All the King`s Men?" And I immediately said, oh, my God. I mean, he`s not only one of the sweetest men I`ve ever met, but a wonderful actor and perfect casting for Ronnie. And he came in to New York, and he came and auditioned. And I went up to the production offices, and read with him. And Todd gave him the part on the spot right there and then. And then he turned to him and said look, "Jackie, do you want to do this?" And this man, who had not worked and had gone through some seriously dark moments, I think as an out-of-work actor, suddenly was given his life back again. And he burst into tears, a grown man burst into tears. 

When he told him he had the part. 

Yes. 

That is a great story. 

It is a great story. And because I know Jackie and I was so happy for him, I then burst into tears too. It was a pretty incredible moment. 

How do you think -- you said it gets better and better. It gets better and better because confidence grows or skills grow or what? 

You just -- you learn so much as an actor that you want to keep learning more and more. And I think the day that I sit up and say, I know how to do this now, is really the day that I should consider stopping, because you can never know enough. You know, I would never claim to know everything about acting. You just -- it`s not possible. And I feel like I very much need direction and guidance from my director, and I absolutely had that with Todd Field. I mean, he -- because he`s an actor too, you know, his understanding of what the actor has to go through in order to go those emotional lengths and become that other person, the support and sort of sense of your hand being held was so strong on this film. It was a really wonderful collaboration. I mean, actors, you know, you hear that -- actors say that a lot, this was great collaboration and blah, blah, blah, blah, but it really was something else. I`d have lots of late night telephone calls with Todd, where he would suddenly call me and say, you know, have you looked at the scene for tomorrow? And I would say, well, yes, obviously, of course. What do you think? And I`d say, well, what do you mean what do I think? He says, well, don`t you think it`s too long? And I would say, well, actually since you asked, perhaps, you know, we could trim it down a little bit here and there. Well, how? Where? What should we do? What do you want to change? And like, why are you asking me? I`m not a writer-- 

The directors have to have to have confidence to do that, too. Because with some directors and some actors, they would take -- they would say to themselves, he doesn`t know what he`s doing. 

He does so know what he`s doing. I mean, and part of the actor`s job, I think, well, certainly for me is you have to put your trust in the director and you have to -- you have to basically do what they want you to do. Even if sometimes you might quietly disagree, it`s very much a part of the job to comply with the director`s every wish. I really do feel like that. And luckily for me on this, you know, I agreed with so much of what Todd wanted all the time. And if I didn`t know what to do sometimes in a scene, I also knew that I could turn to him and say, oh, give me an idea. Help me, help me. You know, I`m stuck. I don`t know how to play this. Just tell me. And he would always come out with-- 

With a word or an idea. 

These little gems that were so helpful. 

What amazes me about acting is this: Is that you could take two people, two very good, talented actors, the same role, the same script, and both of them could do it in their own way and different way, and both would be right. And both would be enjoyable. There is no right way to get inside a character. 

No, but I think, again, that`s one of the things about acting that I love so much is that there is no right or wrong. That you can -- sometimes you can just play and play and play, and just see what happens. And I think a sense of mystery that`s involved in every single day of shooting is just so glorious. It really is so glorious. And you have to be confident and brave enough to make mistakes as well. You know, sometimes it is not always going to go according to plan. Sometimes you might do something that`s just not very good. And you have to be brave enough to make that mistake in front of a crew of people who you barely know sometimes. And it`s just all about experimenting. And we very much had that on "Little Children." Very much so. 

Easier to do that on film than on the stage, because you can be edited on film. 

Oh, yes, absolutely. You know, on film, at least you can stop in the middle and say, no, no, no, this is all going very badly. Let`s just start again. You can`t do that on stage. 

Or you can come back the next day. 

Yes, exactly. 

Let me take a look. Here`s a scene from "Little Children." 

I think I understand your feelings about this book. I used to have some problems with it myself. When I read it in grand school, Madam Bovary just seemed like a fool. She marries the wrong man, makes one foolish mistake after another. But when I read it this time, I just fell in love with her. She`s trapped. It`s a choice. She can either accept a life of misery or she can struggle against it. She chooses to struggle. 

Some struggle. Hopping into bed with every guy who says hello. 

Well, she fails in the end, but there`s something beautiful and even heroic in her rebellion. My professors would kill me for even thinking this, but in her own strange way, Emma Bovary is a feminist. 

Oh, that`s nice. So now cheating on your husband makes you a feminist? 

No, no, no, it`s not the cheating. It`s the hunger. The hunger for an alternative. And the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness. 

Maybe I didn`t understand the book. 

What happens to her here? There is a man who comes to the playground. He has his own life. We`ve seen a scene in the trailer. He`s a little bit worried about the bar exam, which he hasn`t passed. He doesn`t have a great thing at home either. 

Yes. 

He`s got a child. 

Yes. 

And all of a sudden these two people who are missing something -- but it doesn`t end like a fairy tale. 

No, it doesn`t. No. But you know, how many things in life do. 

Life is not a fairy tale. 

And that`s why that`s something that I think is very unique about this film, is that it is -- it`s very unafraid to just talk about things that are harsh but true. And I love that about it. I think it`s really quite powerful because of how real it is and because of how true to life it might feel to some people. What happens to Sarah is she`s plodding along through life. She`s accepting that this is just the way it`s going to be. It`s just a road to nowhere and somehow she`s just going to have to hang on to herself. 

Sees no way out. 

Sees absolutely no way out. And I think if she really thought about that as seriously as perhaps she should, she would probably just run off alone and leave everybody behind. But she accepts it all, she puts on a brave face, and she talks to these other mothers in the playground-- 

Right, as we just saw. 

-- as we just saw. That was one of them, Marry Ann, who is one of the very strict mothers, whose rigid adherence to snack times with her kids is rather horrifying. But they talk about this guy, this attractive guy they`ve seen coming to the playground over the last few weeks. And they`ve taken to calling him the Prom King because he reminds them of a prom king, and he is devastatingly handsome. And Sarah can`t quite believe how giddy they are over this man. But then, he appears, and yes, he`s absolutely gorgeous. And one of them dares her to go and get his phone number, she says five bucks if you can get his phone number. And so she takes the bet. 

Hold it right there. Here`s a scene. 

Do you guys come here a lot? 

No, just the last few weeks. I usually go to the one over on Harris with the big wood things, you know, and the slide across. 

Yeah, we actually rent a house right around the corner from there, on Ashfore. That ice cream truck never leaves. Such a nightmare. 

Yes, tell me about it. 

You know, you`re the first person here who has ever talked to me. 

You make them nervous. 

Oh, right. I guess they don`t see too many fathers here during weekdays. You don`t have to be polite. Go ahead and ask. 

What? 

What is the person who wears the pants in the family does for a living. 

Oh. All right. What does your wife do? 

She makes documentaries. 

Oh, wow. Like Michael Moore? 

Like PBS. 

Oh. 

Now, you were watching that. Tell me how -- what you saw and thought through your actor`s eyes. 

I just was thinking once again, I was thinking, God, that dialogue is just so good. The dialogue was so, just so natural. You know, you just feel like those two people are chit-chatting, having a conversation. Almost feels like it could have been improvised, but every line of dialogue was scripted for that particular scene. And I was very -- we shot that in one day. And I was thinking, I was thinking, yes, I remember, this was the moment when both the kids threw up. And I said to them before we shot the scene, I said, OK, is there going to be breaks? Because you know, swinging these three-year-olds for three, four hours, that they are just going to be sick. And everybody was like, no, I`m sure they`ll be absolutely fine. One after the other. But I was also remembering how nervous I was shooting that scene, because it`s so pivotal. I mean, it`s such an important scene. The end of it, what happens -- and I am going to tell what happens at the end of that scene -- Sarah, she goes to him and she says, one of those women over there bet me five bucks that I couldn`t get your phone number. And then they realize that she doesn`t have a pen, and then Sarah decides to take it one step further and she says, you know, what would really freak them out -- and they kiss. They kiss. And this is the first time these people have ever met in their lives. And it`s the beginning of the rest of the movie. So I knew that nailing that scene was possibly more important than any other scene in the film, any of the nude scenes, any of the scenes towards the end, where it becomes very highly charged and very emotional. That scene for me was absolutely everything, because it`s the springboard to everything that happens, every step of the way beyond that. It`s the beginning of their erotic affair. 

And they both know it. 

And they both know it in many ways. And it`s, you know, Sarah, from that point on, she becomes unleashed and unveiled. And this affair that she has with Brad reveals who she really is and sort of gives her her sense of self back again. You know, she hasn`t felt sexy for years and years and years. She`s never felt as in love with somebody as she does with this particular man. And, you know, those are really wonderful things. I mean, it completely transforms her. 

There`s a certain sense of not sure how they`re doing. In a certain -- there are certain misgivings about it. Here I am, should I be here? Is this OK? Yes? Am I right? 

As an actor, you mean? 

No, I mean in words in the script. 

Yes, yes, oh, yes. 

You have two people in different times saying, should we be doing this, rather than this is unbelievable. 

Yes, I know. 

You know what I mean? 

Yes, I do, absolutely. 

They`ve come to this moment yet--. 

Yes, and he says to her, do you feel bad about this? And she just says no. 

No. 

And he says, I do. I feel really bad. But in spite of those feelings, you know, it still happens. I think -- and that is representative of some deep need in both of them as individuals. I think it`s a more realized need on her part, but on his part, I don`t think he realized how much of a great gaping emotional gap there was in his life and how little he was actually being nourished in his own marriage, and how much indeed he needs this affair, he needs this relationship. And for Sarah, you know, just to do something that makes her feel completely different to any other moment that she`s experienced in her life up until this point is so fantastic. It`s so fantastic. And so brave. And there were many things about her that I loved in that sense. You know, she, you know, she`s living in this place and everything that I was saying before, and she`s stuck and trapped and et cetera. But she doesn`t conform. She doesn`t change herself or adapt herself in order to fit in more. She doesn`t try and become one of these other playground women. She-- 

She never was and would never be. 

No, exactly. But I think that`s a testament to her strength of character, because it`s very easy when you`re emotionally low and you`re in an environment you don`t feel you fit in. I mean, I remember this from my school days. You sort of feel like, oh, well, maybe I should -- maybe I should do my hair like they`re doing their hair and maybe they`ll like me more. You know, there`s something very naive about that and weak ultimately. And Sarah doesn`t do that at all. She just remains who she is. And she doesn`t put on lipstick just because the other mothers do. And she doesn`t, you know, she doesn`t stick to snack times in the same kind of routinely way as they do. Nor does she sort of bitch and bicker and gossip about everyone else in the town. She`s just not that woman. She`s above it in many ways. 

OK, so she has this experience, she has this incredible experience. What`s going to happen to her? Is she forever changed? 

Yes. I think she is forever changed, but I love the fact that you asked me that question, simply because it means that you would actually kind of like to know what happens beyond that and you care about her enough to want to know. And I think that`s great, that this character is sort of in some way, people want to know what her life after this movie is. 

Of course. 

I think that her life is forever changed. And I think that she goes home with her little girl, realizing how much of not only a terrible parent she`s been, but how much she has missed out on, how much she has been denying herself and denying her child in terms of happiness, just simply by looking into the eyes of that child and being the mother that the child needs for her to be. And I think she also knows that her chance of future happiness entirely rests in being with this little girl and making that her priority. Do I believe she goes home to her husband? No. I think she goes home for a while. She`s probably going to figure out what to do for a week or two. And then sure, she`s going to leave. She may even move to another country. She`ll probably steal a couple of his credit cards along the way as well. I wouldn`t put it past to say, you know what, you owe me. 

Exactly. And I`m out of here. 

Exactly. 

There is -- the interesting thing about him is that he`s coming alive in lots of different ways. It`s camaraderie with his buddies, playing football and doing these other things. I mean, there is a sense that his life has begun to change. He`s more open. Don`t you agree? 

I do. I do agree. And I think that--. 

He passes a test there with these guys who didn`t know whether he would measure up. They were cops. 

He does. Absolutely. I think that he, you know, Brad is a man who was -- he may have wanted to deny it, but he was a stay-at-home dad. And you know, his wife was putting pressure on him. His wife, played by Jennifer Connelly, putting pressure on him to take the bar exam again. He had failed it a couple of times before. And yet, he just doesn`t want to be a lawyer. He doesn`t really know what he wants to be, or who he is anymore. The one thing he does know is that he loves his son more than anything else in the world. And he is an absolutely wonderful dad. But I think Sarah makes him realize that he hasn`t been loved like that for a very long time. And he hasn`t felt so known by someone, certainly not a woman, in the way that she seems to know him. She seems to sort of unleash him in the same way that he unleashes her. And he gets to be a little bit more confident and to realize that he hasn`t challenged himself in any way at all in his life for a long time in the course of his marriage, and starts playing football again. This is something he did very successfully at college. And sort of makes friends with some of these guys who are around him all the time, but who he doesn`t really connect with. And they both give each other a little bit of life back. And that`s very real, I think, about love and what happens when you fall in love with somebody, is that you are given -- you are given so much of your soul in a way that you`ve never been given it before. And in a way that perhaps you haven`t realized, you know, you had it inside of you. And it just takes a little, the turn of the key and all of those things are revealed. 

"All the King`s Men" is in theaters now. Still is. The story of Huey Long. "Little Children" is in theaters now. "Flushed Away" will be in theaters November 3rd, and "The Holiday" comes on December 8th. 

Yes. Lots going on. 

Thank you for coming. 

You`re welcome. 

Great to see you.
