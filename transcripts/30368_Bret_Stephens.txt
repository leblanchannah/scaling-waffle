We begin this evening with our continuing coverage of the events in Syria. The Trump administration has accused Russia of an attempt to confuse the world about who is responsible for last week's chemical weapons attack. The U.S. maintains there is no doubt that the Syrian regime was behind the assault which provoked America's retaliatory airstrikes. The charge of a Russian cover-up comes as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is on a visit to Moscow where his goal is to convince Russians to stop backing president Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. airstrikes have revived the debate about President Obama's legacy on Syria and the Trump administration's policy moving forward. At a Pentagon press conference this afternoon, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said ISIS remains a top priority for the United States. Joining me now from Washington Tony Blinken. He is the former Deputy Secretary of State and Deputy National Security Advisor for President Obama. Here in New York, Bret Stephens. He is a foreign affairs columnist for the "Wall Street Journal." I am pleased to have both of them on this program. I want to begin with a column that's gotten a lot of attention certainly in terms of people that I know who care about these kinds of issues, called "The Price Of Obama's Mendacity." And you go on to talk about where there's always this debate about the wisdom of Barack Obama's decision to forego a similar strike under similar circumstances in 2013. That's the beginning, the end says, "Mr. Obama and his advisers will never run out of self-justifications for their policy in Syria. They can't outrun responsibility for the consequences of their lies. 

Right, well after President Obama, President Putin of Russia and John Kerry engineered the agreement by which Syria was supposed to relinquish its entire stockpile of banned chemical weapons, information began to emerge pretty quickly thereafter that the Syrians were cheating on the agreement. It started filtering out in 2014. The "Wall Street Journal" had a front-page story on the fact in 2015 and in 2016 Jim Clapper, former director of National Intelligence, even acknowledged it to a congressional committee. Throughout the entire period, however, leading figures of the Obama administration, including the president, the Secretary of State, and just this January, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, kept insisting that the Obama administration, that the deal had gotten 100 percent of the chemical weapons out, creating an illusion, which by the way, the Trump administration seemed to share, at least in its first few months, that Assad had been defanged of his most dangerous weapons. What we've just seen in northern Syria with the sarin attack on this village is that that was untrue and that he maintains the stockpile, and I have to ask Mr. Blinken, how is it that the Obama administration kept going on saying, 100 percent of the weapons without qualification, when they knew from their own intelligence reporting and in fact publicly available sources that that was not the case, that Assad was cheating on the deal, that he maintained this stockpile, and of course, the ability to use it. 

And the second part of this is the Russians should have known about this and was there complicity. 

Of course the Russians were complicit, and one of the things that is most disturbing of course about this attack is that you have Russians on the same air base, it seems, where these weapons were being stored. But the question about Russian mendacity is not even interesting. The Russians lie. I don't think any of us would raise an eyebrow about that. What disturbs me is why the Obama administration offered a story about this deal which simply -- wasn't simply true but which they seem to -- they should have known or did know was not true. 

Well first, let me just say that I very much admire a lot of what Bret's written recently in defense of the truth, but here I think he's barking up the wrong tree. Let's rewind the tape for just a second. We faced this horrific situation in 2013 with this chemical weapons attack in Syria. We prepared to use force. We then went to Congress to see if we could get authority to do it. That got bogged down in debate. Then the Russians came in and decided to broker a deal by which the Syrians declared all the chemical weapons that they had, which they had never done before, agreed to give them up and destroy them in a verifiable way. They declared 1,300 tons of chemicals and various infrastructure that went along with it. A year later the group charged with monitoring the destruction of those chemicals, the OPCW, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said that they had in fact destroyed their declared weapons, and here's where the discrepancy is. We knew all along and we said publicly, repeatedly that we were concerned that there were gaps between what they had declared and what they actually had and we went repeatedly to the OPCW, to the United Nations, to the Russians to try to press the Syrians on those gaps to make sure that we in fact gotten everything we could. But if you go back and look at virtually all the statements, we were referring to the declared capability that they had and we repeatedly raised concerns about the gaps. But here's the thing, Charlie and Bret. Imagine if we had not done this deal. We could not have struck the chemical weapons. That would have created a chemical cloud that would have poisoned the very people we were trying to protect. Instead, we were able to get everything that we knew about that was declared out of the country. Every single country in the region was better off and actually said so. Israel had been giving gas masks to its people before this deal, afraid of the strategic attack by Syria using chemical weapons. After the deal was struck, they stopped that program. They told us -- they told our ambassador that what we had achieved strategically was far more effective than had we actually gone -- used force not against the chemical weapons, but against some airfields and airplanes. If we hadn't done the deal, 1,300 tons of chemical weapons would still be floating around Syria, not only in the hands of the Assad regime, but potentially in the hands of the Islamic State, Nusra, and other terrorist groups. So, was it a perfect deal? Absolutely not, and we said so all along. Are we manifestly better off because we did it? Yes. 

The imperfections of this deal are now becoming apparent in the deaths of innocent victims in northern Syria. But, look, the president said we got 100 percent of the weapons. He didn't say we got 100 percent of the declared stockpile, and, by the way, we have concerns. I don't remember -- and you probably don't remember the president going to Congress and ringing alarm bells that Bashar al-Assad was in violation of the agreements that covered him. John Kerry said 100 percent of the weapons. Now, every now and then you would hear second tier administration officials like Samantha Power raise alarms and use the word "declared" which was a very lawyerly way of acknowledging that they knew that there were these discrepancies. But does anyone watching this show, can anyone say we seriously remember that a major theme of the Obama administration's second term was pointing to the discrepancy between what was declared and what was -- what we knew about? Now, Mr. Blinken might be right, that there's an argument to be had that getting out those 1,300 tons of sarin, VX, and other gas and other poisons was worth the price. But I'm -- and I say this explicitly in the article, there's one argument to be had about the wisdom. I think it was a very unwise deal which sent a signal that American red lines were useless and that also prevented us from carrying out retaliatory strikes once we knew that Assad was violating the deal. What I'm questioning here is the honesty. The simple fact is that the Obama administration cannot say with a straight face that, except in press releases that nobody noticed, that it was trumpeting the discrepancy between what Assad had declared -- supposed to have done and what he actually did. The administration allowed the deal to be violated and the question is, why? I suspect and I would love to hear Mr. Blinken talk about this, I suspect it is because achieving a deal with Syria's patron state, Iran, was so important to the Obama administration that it did not want to rock this particular boat, that's an allegation that's been aired, not simply by me, but in "The Atlantic," other publications. I'd love to hear -- learn more about the influence that the thinking about the Iran deal, the importance of reaching that deal for Obama had on his unwillingness to expose the extent to which Assad was violating his commitments. 

Well, first of all, the Iran deal was a good deal, it was the right thing to do, but apples and oranges, one had nothing to do with the other. There is no relationship between what we did on Syria and our ongoing support for that agreement, even as we tried to close the gaps and find the discrepancies, and doing the Iran deal, period. That's the truth. Look, I come back to this basic proposition, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. At the time, the choice before us was to use force against the will of Congress and apparently against the will of the American people. We were in the midst of that debate. Not strike all of the chemical weapons, in fact, not strike any of the chemical weapons given the danger that that would have represented to the people we were trying to protect, and instead, use diplomacy without firing a shot to get far more of the chemical weapons out than we could have had we used force. That's a good deal. That puts in a materially better place. 

No it's -- it's not because you had an option to destroy the Syrian air force. You had an option, even if the chemical weapons were not destroyed, to destroy the means by which Assad would be capable of delivering those weapons and later, by the way, after 2013, weapons like barrel bombs, chlorine gases, responsible for a level of destruction that I think is so vast that the U.N. has stopped counting how many people are dead in Syria, and that's also the consequence of the refusal to act in Syria. So what you're suggesting is that our only military option would have been some deadly, dangerous Chernobyl-type event on Syrian air bases. What we just showed, what the Trump administration, of all administrations, just showed is it's quite possible to destroy the means of delivery and therefore neutralize the threat without putting civilians at risk by destroying those weapons. I think it's such a shame that, four years ago, 100,000 deaths ago, the Obama administration failed to act that way. 

Tony. 

As you know, Bret, early on in the war, before they started using their air force, 90 percent of the victims of the Syrian regime's aggression were coming from rockets, shells, mortars, et cetera, including those filled with chemical ammunitions. Had we been able to take the entire air force out of the sky, and we can certainly debate that proposition, they would simply have gone back to that. Then we would've had to have stopped that. That would have drawn us in further and further and further. Now, it's a perfectly reasonable argument to say we made the wrong judgment, we should have gone in whole hog, but that was the judgment we made, but it would not have stopped them from using chemical weapons. 

But isn't that the heart of the matter that the president did not want to be drawn into a civil war in Syria? 

I think that does go to the heart of the matter, but the specific issue before us in 2013 was chemical weapons. A norm that had been violated, a norm that was established after World War I, a sacred norm that went beyond Syria, and as horrific as everything that has happened in Syria was, this went even a step further in violating something that the international community said simply couldn't happen anymore after World War I. It was important to uphold that norm, we did, and did it diplomatically. 

Actually you failed to do so. The president made a clear military threat which he then failed to honor and that caused consternation in the region and around the world, and frankly, it created the perception that President Obama was a guy who in the event of the use of chemical weapons, would give an eloquent speech and find some kind of face-saving solution. 

Let me bring us to where we are now. Robert Ford, the former ambassador was a guest on the show last night and here is what he said. 

My own sense is that the war in Syria that involves Bashar al-Assad is already basically finished and Assad won. So we're not going to get into a new Iraq kind of war or a new Afghanistan kind of war in Syria. 

The civil war is essentially over? 

The civil war is essentially -- there may be some more fighting for another year or two. The opposition is not going to give up, but they're not going to win. Assad's going to win. 

Assad's going to win. 

Well, I think that's -- first of all, I'm not sure I agree with Ambassador Ford that if Assad remains in power that the fighting eventually stops. In fact, I think, so long as Assad remains in power, Sunnis will rise up to oppose him. He's not that strong even with the help of the Russians. What I am convinced of is that as complicated -- and Anthony, by the way, is right -- as complicated as Syria is, there is no solution in Syria while he remains president of the country. 

Here's the challenge, if I could. How do civil wars end? We've looked at this intensely -- one of three ways. Either one side wins, but I agree with Bret. I don't think that's -- and I disagree with Robert Ford. I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon. Whenever one side gets the advantage, the outside patrons of the other side come in and prop them up. Second, they fight to exhaustion. That will happen eventually except that, historically at least, it's taken 10 years and we're now in year seven of this war and -- 

And third they negotiate. 

-- where there are multiple parties involved, not just two. Third, they negotiate with and here's where the judgment comes in, and there are legitimate differences in judgment. Third, some kind of outside intervention that combines some element of military force and diplomacy, and I think a legitimate criticism of our administration is that there may have been moments when we could have married more leverage to the diplomacy. But no one, not the Russians, not the Iranians, not us, not any of the outside patrons were willing to go in on our own enough to actually win the war for one side or the other. That was not going to happen. It's not going to happen. 

Part of the problem with our thinking about Syria is that we keep insisting that Syria ought to remain, in the end game, a unitary state. If we had insisted that Yugoslavia emerge from its wars as a unitary state, we'd probably be fighting there or people would be fighting there today. It makes no sense for anyone to contemplate a future of Syria in which there's one Syrian state. Why? Because so long as it's just one Syria, it will always be a zero sum struggle for power. It will be one side winning and the other side losing. That needn't be the case in Syria. There is a perfectly credible case that, in a messy way, you could have an Alawite state centered around the coastal cities of Latakia, the Mediterranean shore of Syria. Kurdish lands could end up -- 

An Alawite state is led by Bashar al-Assad. 

No, an Alawite state is led by any Alawite other than Bashar al-Assad. That ought to be -- and/or the Assad family -- that ought to be a condition. You should be able to take part of the Kurdish areas and create another autonomous zone protected as we protected the Kurds in northern Iraq. By the way the most successful experiment in nation building in the Middle East, all thanks to a "no fly" zone, all thanks to American limited but decisive American military intervention. 

OK, but that's a long-term solution but you seem to be agreeing with General Mattis who said, you know, our first target, our strategy is to eliminate ISIS. 

I think that's a mistake. ISIS is a terrible -- look, ISIS is evil incarnate, right. But ISIS is not the kind of strategic threat to the United States or to our allies in the region that Assad is or will be if he remains in power and creates a nexus between Tehran, Damascus, Beirut with Hezbollah, and Moscow. 

People continue to say that you cannot have negotiation, Tony, unless you have leverage on the ground and where is leverage on the ground coming from? 

Well, look, I think we actually do have some leverage now in part as a result of the strike that the Trump administration took. The question is, are they prepared to use that? 

But is that the history of strikes like this, I mean, you know, from whether it's the Clinton administration or where it is, that these strikes -- the one-up strikes create that kind of shift in behavior or shift in -- 

One-off -- no. Charlie, you're right, one-off doesn't. You have to have a sustained strategy and it has to have all the elements that you normally associate with a strategy including a clear diplomatic play and I hope that's what the administration is coming to. But, look, Bret may well be right that ultimately in Syria the solution is going to be some kind of partition, but let's not kid ourselves about how challenging and difficult that would be. You mentioned just among other pieces of this puzzle, a possible Kurdish autonomous region. Our friends in Turkey are not exactly going to be enthusiastic about that. It's not going to be easy to do anything there. You'll have statelets that are going at each other -- that are at each other's throats repeatedly. You'll probably have some area that is controlled, in effect, by ISIL or by the Nusra Front, that is inimical, to say the least, to our interests. So, it may well be that that's where this goes but we also shouldn't underestimate how challenging it would be to get there, and to say the least, how imperfect that solution would be. 

But as we contemplate a variety of imperfect solutions, let's not lose sight of the fact that what we have now is almost like a Hurricane Sandy in place sowing destruction in Syria and chaos amongst all of its neighbors. You now have repeated ISIS attacks in Turkey. You now have Jordan straining under the weight of more than a million refugees. You've had really the implosion of the state system in the Middle East, Russian power entrenching itself once again. As we contemplate -- the refugee crisis, all the while we're saying, gee, this is hard, this is difficult, but what's even harder and more difficult has been the consequence of inaction. I just want to ask Tony very quickly, John Kerry, Ann Marie Slaughter, senior figures in the Obama administration have both come out and praised this strike. Why do you think they're praising it? If they weren't, in fact, dissidents within the Obama administration of the policy that you guys ultimately pursued? There was a lot of unhappiness inside the Obama administration for the failure to act in 2013 and for the absolutely hands-off policy based on the bugaboo that, as you put it, you put one toe in and the next thing you know, our whole body is in the water. 

And also there is the idea of leverage. They thought you needed some leverage because Kerry was not successful in the negotiations with the Russians because they had no leverage. I mean, he frequently made that point. But Tony, my understanding is you have said that you supported this strike but now was the time for diplomacy. 

Well, yes, I came out immediately at a lesser level than John Kerry or others in support of what the Trump administration did. It was the right thing to do, and the question now is whether there is follow-through, whether there is a way to use this to actually make progress on the Syrian civil war. That's the big question before us. But again, you have to look at everything in the context of its time and the moment. And going back to 2013, again, the decision before us was whether to strike, not hit the chemicals, not destroy them, or do the diplomacy which we ended up doing and get rid of the declared stockpile of chemical weapons. Every country in the region is better off and actually everyone is better off as horrific as things remain because as bad as Syria is today, Syria awash in 1,300 tons of chemical weapons in the hands of al Qaeda, in the hands of the Islamic State and in the hands of Assad would be an even worse catastrophe than it already is. 

Was there no way you could do both, get the chemical weapons out because of the agreement and then maintain the option of the airstrike because of violation of their red line? 

Charlie, here's the question, and look, and I know Bret is sensitive to this, too -- and it's a decision and a question before anyone faced with these kinds of situations. You take a strike and then the target not only doesn't respond but keeps on with the bad behavior, so then everyone says, OK, better take another strike, he didn't respond. He still doesn't respond, he continues with bad behavior, more barrel bombs. So, better do it again, and again and again and again, and, pretty soon, you are caught in a cycle where you don't control the escalation and you wind up getting drawn further and further in. Anyone who is responsible has to at least factor that concern in. 

But let me ask you -- let's assume that you're right and that getting those 1,300 tons of chemical weapons out of Syria was worth the diplomatic bargain, was worth erasing the red line. OK, but then there is an expectation that the declared stockpile is, in fact, the real stockpile and that violations will be punished. You had three and a half years to punish violations. At least two of those years you knew full well that Assad was violating the deal and yet nothing was done. And I guess my question is why not? 

Well two, things, Bret. First, there are two kinds of violations. One is this question of whether there were gaps and discrepancies between what they declared and what they held on to. And that we were pushing on virtually every single day but we were working it through the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We were working it through the U.N. We were working it through the Russians. The Syrians made four amendments to their declaration over that period of time, acknowledging more stuff that originally they said they didn't have. So we thought that we were getting at it that way. Imperfect, but we were making progress. The second question and it's a very legitimate one, is the fact that even after the agreemen
