President Trump's vision to remake American healthcare was dealt a surprising and devastating blow today, the president and House Republican leaders decided to pull legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act after facing stiff resistance from both conservative and moderate factions within the party. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan rushed to the White House to alert the president he lacked the votes to move forward. He addressed reporters later this afternoon to explain why the vote did not take place. 

We came really close today, but we came up short. I spoke to the president just a little while ago. I told him that the best thing I think to do is pull this bill and he agreed with that decision. I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. 

Joining me from Capitol Hill is Kelsey Snell. She covers Congress for "The Washington Post." Welcome. 

Thank you so much for having me. 

What a week. 

It has been quite a whirlwind. We started out this week, thinking we would be ending with our first vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and here we are having it all gone up in smoke. 

What does that mean? That it's gone up in smoke, for the future of the president, the Speaker of the House, the Freedom Caucus, and Democrats? 

We've already heard the president say that this is the fault of Democrats and that this didn't work out because Democrats wouldn't help them out. But in reality, what happened here is that the Republican Party just couldn't coalesce around a single message. They couldn't decide what it was they wanted to do once Obamacare was repealed. They all have agreed for many, many years that repeal was the goal, but the finer details wound up getting the best of them. I think there is a real question now about what kind of governing coalition exists within the Republican Party and how Republicans in the House will work together, how they'll work with the president, and if anybody's really in control here. 

Does it mean that the Freedom Caucus has some kind of veto in close votes? 

I mean, they do at this point have enough votes that if they stick together, they can stop any legislation. This was a real test for them. If they had backed down, if they had met with the president and walked away, saying that "he was charming, he was a good salesman and he won us over," and walked away, they wouldn't have that power. But they've reaffirmed something that they've been trying to establish for years, which is that they can stick together better than other factions of the Republican Party. 

What does it mean for President Trump's ability to use the bully pulpit? 

It means that he -- actually, we don't really know. What we know is he can pressure some people but not everybody, and we don't know exactly how voters and his core constituents are going to respond to this. It's entirely possible that they don't blame Trump and they blame House Speaker Paul Ryan, because, as Trump said, he did not want this to be called Trumpcare. He wanted to call it something else and the name Ryancare has kind of stuck, so this failure may fall to the Speaker of the House rather than the president. 

But doesn't the president need Ryan for every other aspect of his agenda? 

He certainly does, but it is important to remember that Ryan shares some of these goals. Ryan desperately would like to get tax reform done, it's something he's been talking about since I can remember. And they agree on that, they agree that this is a goal. And there are some people up here who feel like repealing the Affordable Care Act was kind of an adopted issue for President Trump and that tax reform really is more at the core of the principles that he kind of ran on and things he has believed in his business career. 

Tax reform and reform in regulations together. 

Yes, and those are two things where they can really find a lot of common ground. And you know, tax reform is really hard. I was a tax reporter for many, many years and I think people discount exactly how complicated it can be. There's a reason it hasn't happened in a generation and there's a reason why this is something that takes time. So we'll be watching very closely for when they actually get started on the process of doing tax reform. 

Does it affect immigration? 

I think immigration is its own separate thing. It affects immigration if they want to build coalitions with Democrats and if they want to do some sort of immigration plan that was kind of "Gang of 8" style, that builds consensus, but at this point, it seems like they need to reset and kind of figure out what their next step is first. 

At the end of the week, where is the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch? 

Well, we were expecting that to happen, not this next week, but the week after, and we haven't heard yet from majority leader Mitch McConnell about whether or not he wants to move up that process in any way. So where it stands now is that Democrats say they're willing to filibuster him and we are going to see a big blowout fight in the Senate once that actually happens. The question now is just how long it takes. 

What about infrastructure spending? 

Infrastructure spending is one of those things that we have heard about for a long time, it was a goal of this current White House in the campaign, but we haven't seen any legislation or really any solid proposals beyond the idea that the president wants to make a large investment there. That is also an area where details matter. Are we talking about roads and bridges? Are we talking about highways or trains? That all still needs to be fleshed out before they can move forward. 

Is the president's credibility damaged? 

You know, I think it is for some people. It's yet to be seen how his core voters feel. His core voters have seemed to be flexible in how they view Trump and they support him as a person. It's about personality first, many of his core voters. So this may or may not actually change their feelings about him. If he can successfully deflect the criticism of what happened this week over to the House Speaker or to someone else, then it's possible he walks away unscathed. 

It is a pleasure to meet you, thank you so much for joining us at the end of a long week. 

Thank you so much for having me. 

We continue with Al Hunt of "Bloomberg view." Al, let me just start by, you've seen lots of weeks in Washington both as a reporter on The Hill and in other remarkably interesting stories that you have followed in different places. How does this match up? 

Charlie, when I was with you on Tuesday, I thought it was an exhausting week, and this is -- it's ten times more exhausting today than it was three days ago. This is just -- I don't think I've ever quite seen a week quite like this, maybe Watergate. I suppose you would have to go back 40-some years, but other than that, I've never quite seen a week like this, with all the legislative and the executive and the law enforcement thing. But the vote today in the House and Friday, the decision to pull the healthcare bill, I must admit was a shocker for me. I thought when you get this close, you're going to pass it and the stakes were so big. This is a devastating defeat for Paul Ryan, for Donald Trump, but also for the Republican Party, which, for seven years, has promised something that they couldn't deliver on. 

Does this mean, according to what Paul Ryan said, that after pulling the bill, you know, that for the foreseeable future the Affordable Care Act will remain in place? 

They have no choice. They'll probably, you know, they'll try to nick it, they'll try to do this and that, but Trump wants them to move on to other things, taxes in particular, and they have to. But once there is blood in the water, it doesn't go away, and sharks continue to sense that blood. So, yes, I think they will be able to turn to other issues now, but this defeat will last for a long time, including on the campaign trail next year. As I say, go back to 2010. If there was any centerpiece to what hundreds of Republicans promised, we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. It ended up an empty promise, Charlie, not just because they failed, but because the product they came up with was one that almost one no one liked. Doctors didn't like it. Hospitals didn't like it. Consumers didn't like it. Liberals, conservatives, it had 17 percent approval in a Quinnipiac poll. The old saying, you can market dog food as well and exquisitely as you want to, but if it isn't any good, the dogs won't eat it. And today, you had not only right wing conservatives, members of the Freedom Caucus, but you had people like Rodney Frelinghuysen, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of the cardinals; Barbara Comstock, a really savvy politician from suburban Washington, a moderate who said, no, I don't care what you say are the stakes, we can't do this. 

So what does it mean in terms of the rest of the president's agenda? 

What it means is that they wasted a couple of months. You know, the first was Pat Moynihan who said, "boy, that first year of presidency is so important, that's when you get things done," so, you know, they've now wasted, I don't know, 15 percent of it. Waste in the sense that they couldn't accomplish anything. They will turn to taxes as soon as they can. That is not going to be easy. The one thing that is apparent now, that was probably apparent beforehand, is Trump is really not a political threat to these members unless it's a member from a conservative district who is voting against Trump on liberal grounds or on more moderate grounds. None of these members were afraid that Trump was going to come out against them in a primary and hurt them, they really weren't. Let me give the president his due. I do think he lobbied this and went member to member as effectively as any president in a long time. A lot of people didn't think he could do that. He did that very well, but he had a product that I don't think he knew much about and you couldn't sell. 

We now talk about the House Freedom Caucus. How is it different from the Tea Party and the caucus that it bred in the House, during the reign of John Boehner? 

It is similar and there are many similar members, people like the aforementioned Jim Jordan in Ohio, I think they feel a bit emboldened, they've been elected two, three, four times, they think they are safe now. They're uncomfortable with Trump. There are things they like about Trump a lot -- Immigration and some of the social issues. They don't think he is a real true believing conservative, because he is not. I think they will be with him on some things but they're not afraid to stand up to him on something like this. 

And what about the immigration? 

Well, I think they would be with him on immigration. I think the problem you have there is to put together a coalition -- I don't think you can get any kind of major immigration through, Charlie, without Democrats. Right now, the mood is not very receptive on the Democratic side to work together on much of anything. That may change by the summer, by May, but right now, it's not very promising. 

And what does it do to whatever factions there are within the White House? Does one gain and the other lose? 

As I said earlier, there were hundreds of members. That was the prime commitment they made, we're going to repeal and replace it and, again, the repeal part was very easy. The replace part was impossible. They ended up with a bill that 24 million people lost their insurance. By the time they were making deals, it really wasn't going to cut the deficit any and it was unpopular. So you can't blame this one on the White House. So, therefore, I'm not quite sure it changes the internal dynamics a lot, although, I'm sure that Steve Bannon will say, see, I told you so. 

Al Hunt in Washington, thank you, my friend. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Back in a moment, stay with us.
