New York's homeless can be found in almost every city and neighborhood. Mayor Dinkins wanted to put shelters in those neighborhoods as well, but the reaction his fair share plan has been, almost, universally negative. "Not in my backyard." say residents. Joining me now to talk about it are Myrtle Whitmore, president of the Brooklyn Civic Council and (inaudible) and Sherletta McCaskill, who was homeless and is interim vice-president of the Homeless Client's Advisory Council for the Coalition for the Homeless. She's been with us before and it's good to see you back. Did I pronounce your last name right? 

It's McCaskill. 

McCaskill, okay. Tell me ... I guess I should turn to you first because of the Mayor's plan and start from there. Why is he on the right approach, by putting these shelters, if that's the right word ... 

Right. I was gonna say, first of all that's a misnomer. They are not shelters. What they are, are transitional housing facilities, and they are planned to be permanent housing facilities. And also, the right track is, pardon me. Okay, the right track is permanent affordable housing for all Americans and all New Yorkers. The issue is not the homeless, the issue is affordable housing. 

And is the Mayor, and the Mayor's plan, on the right track when he talks of putting them in a variety of communities within the city? 

Absolutely, because homeless people come from all five boroughs. They're not just strictly located in the south Bronx or they don't all come from Harlem. There are homeless people all over the city, and they have the same problems that every other community has. So, it's not isolated to just people in shelters. 

So, what do you think of the Mayor's plan? 

Well, first of all, they're not transitional housing as we understand it. Sherletta is very lovely, beautiful, she presents a lovely picture, but she's not the person that they're making this housing for. They're planning the housing for single men, from 50-200 in every neighborhood. Not women. Not families. Single men. And according to statistics, about 75% of the single homeless men either suffer with drug addiction, alcoholism or mentally ill and they're going to go, and go into stable communities and put these shelters in the middle of stable communities. Now, Charlie you know, that the homeless people who live on the streets say that they refuse to go to the shelters because they're dangerous. Now if the homeless people don't want to live in the shelters, why build more? Secondly, if they're afraid of the shelters, what do you think of people in these communities who have no control over them? They're not jails. The people can wander in and out, and that's what I'm talking about, the shelters for homeless single men. 

I would say that Ms. Whitmore is terribly misinformed. The fact of the matter is there are a total of 26,000 people in the shelters. That includes men and women. It includes families and children. 8,000 of those are single adults which includes women as well as men and the fact of the matter is is these shelters or rather transitional housing facilities are planned for that 8,000 single population. It will not just be single men that are being housed. Again, the issue is housing. First of all, homeless people, our homeless are being vilified by the media and characterized as criminals and drug addicts and so forth. The fact of the matter is that 15% to 20% of the homeless are drug or alcohol addicted and only 10% are mentally ill. That leaves a vast majority of poor, black and Hispanic Americans, New Yorkers who need affordable housing and need jobs. That's why people are homeless because they cannot afford market value rent. If you work 40 hours a week making $6.00 an hour, by the time taxes are taken out of your weekly salary, you're only bringing home $205.00 a week and that's at $6.00 an hour, not minimum wage. The issue is decent affordable housing. 

I'm not misinformed. 

The homeless are always- 

I'm not misinformed about the statistics. 

You are misinformed because these are HRA statistics. These are not my statistics. This is from the Human Resources Administration. 

No, no, the city statistics show that about 25% are alcoholics, about 35% are mentally ill. If you add them up now the plans are really Carolina, they're not for all the people in the shelters. 

We could debate statistics all night long. 

Well, it's what the man said. 

The issue is decent, affordable housing. It's not a matter of- 

This is not decent, affordable housing. 

Every single community in Manhattan whether it be the Bronx, whether is be Queens, whether it be Staten Island, all these communities share the same common problems. People in those communities have drug and alcohol problems. People in those communities have mental health problems. People in those communities need jobs and need decent, affordable housing. The issue is, you should be on our side because we're saying that we want a solution to the problem. In 10 years of shelter politics the homeless have never been consulted. The homeless are never a part of policy making or decisions. 

The taxpayers haven't been consulted either. 

We -- the shelter and so are the homeless. The homeless are also taxpayers. 

Well just a moment. May I say something? 

I'm a working person. I can't afford a rent apartment. 

May I say something? 

I want to be part of the decision making so I can have a decent, affordable house to live in and live like you. 

May I please say something? The taxpayers have never been consulted either. 

The homeless are taxpayers, and that issues has not been addressed. 

The taxpayers have not ... Just a minute. May I just-- 

Okay. We need to stop talking over each other and I'll ask ... Go ahead. 

May I just-- 

Live in the shelters and don't work. People work every day, but they cannot afford a market value apartment. 

We cannot discuss this if we're talking about different solutions. The mayor's plans- 

The solution is decent, affordable housing. 

I want you to let her finish. 

I was a public housing manager, I know what housing is. I own real estate. I know what good housing is. 

You're very lucky because you own something. 

We're talking here- 

We're talking about poor people who don't own a damn thing. We're talking about working. 

We are talking here about shelters for single men. 

Again, there are not shelters or transitional housing facility. 

It's been shelters. It's in the paper. 

If you read the literature that Mayor Dinkins commission put out himself. 

No, no. They are identified they're for single man. 

Read the literature. 

Let me stop this now and say we don't want any more to debate this notion of who they are for and who they are not. Your objection beyond that is that for the people in the communities where these shelters are proposed to be located- 

Yes. 

That the people in those communities have a right to say, "We do not want shelter for the homeless or homes for the homeless or permanent addition for the homeless in our neighborhood." 

They never said that. They never said that they wouldn't accept renovated housing, they wouldn't accept low-income housing. They said they know that the shelter plan is a failure. It has failed. Even the homeless people don't want to go into the shelters. I'm concerned- Just a moment please. I'm concerned with the taxpayers money. Why build something when even the homeless people don't want to go in? Number one. Number two, they're selecting stable communities. 

You know that the homeless would not want to go into a different kind of shelter. 

Right. Ask me and I'll let. 

You have to go by experience. The experience has been that the city does not run good shelters. You ask- 

If non-profit people were running it as Andrew Cuomo has recommended, in an invariance with the mayor's plan, it would be a better idea from your vantage point. 

For some of them. If non-profit people would run it, it might be a little better, but that is not the plan. They're going into a neighborhood like Kings Highway where you have a parking lot for where shoppers go. It's a busy shopping center. They want to take that shopping center, that parking lot, and put a homeless shelter there for 200 single men. Now, don't tell me the kind of people in the shelters. First of all, you have to separate them. The city should sit down and stop calling everybody "homeless." They should separate it into drug addicts and treat them. They should separate it into other- 

First of all- 

Wait a minute. 

Hold on a second. (inaudible) I'm going to come to a point. 

They should separate them into the mentally ill and reactivate those mental hospitals. The temporarily- 

This sounds like a lot of the ideas that I've heard Andrew Cuomo make. Do you disagree with the point she's making? 

First, I disagree. First of all because it seems that always that homeless are being blamed as the implementers of these plans and these horrible conditions that you speak of when in fact they are the victims of policy. Not once in 10 years of shelter politics have the homeless themselves been consulted. 

We have- 

Witness Mayor Cuomo or Andrew Cuomo's commission. Not one person on the commission who purports to be expert in solving the problem has a homeless. The homeless are never consulted. 

We've got a member of the city council and Jack Newfield also coming on to join us now. 

Neither are the taxpayers. 

I'm a taxpayer. 

We'll take a break and bring them in as we continue this conversation. Stay with us. Back in a moment.
