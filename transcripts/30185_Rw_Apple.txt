Welcome to the broadcast. The nation continues to be transfixed by the Judge Clarence Thomas affair that is going on in Washington. The Senate continues to get a lot of phone calls from people around the country talking about that issue and the hearings that will be held on Friday and the vote that will come up next week. We will talk about that also during this broadcast. Later, we'll meet Terrence McNally, the playwright who has a new film that he wrote the screenplay for called, "Frankie and Johnny". We will also meet members of the 761st battalion. That is a black battalion during World War II. They rescued survivors at Buchenwald and Dachau the concentration camps. They will be here in a pre-recorded interview to talk about that experience. It is a moving reunion between survivors and their liberators. First up, I want to show you this from the New York Times today. You'll see a picture of women that are, Congresswomen, that are going on Capitol Hill to protest members of the Senate about the handling of the confirmation hearings of Judge Thomas. Here is the Washington Post seeing the same women coming across the Capitol steps. We will talk about that later with four people who have some sense of the pressure that has been applied in Washington to get a delay in the confirmation vote that was scheduled to take place at 6:00 last night. First up, RW Apple Jr., the distinguished national correspondent for The New York Times in Washington joins us by phone to get a sense of what the nation's capital is like this 11:00 on Wednesday night. Johnny can you hear me? 

Surely can. 

What is the feeling in the capital this evening? Do you expect new disclosures? Is it just a sense of anticipation, waiting for the Friday confrontation between Judge Thomas and the committee and also the confrontation between the attorney? 

There's a lot of activity on a lot of levels, some of it public and some of it private. The Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing behind the scenes about what the ground rules will be. How broadly can the Democrats, the Anti-Thomas Democrats cast their net? It's pretty well agreed that they can't come back to questions of ideology and questions of his views on big issues like abortion and such like. The question is how much latitude will they have to probe aspects of his character, just the sexual harassment or other sorts of things. The Democrats, the Anti-Thomas people, obviously want those rules to be as lenient as possible. The Republicans want them to be as broad as possible. You got a foretaste of that publicly last night when John (Danforth 00:04:26), the sponsor so to speak of Clarence Thomas' candidacy in the Senate, wanted to have two more days, Bob Dole said 3 more days and the Democrats insisted on a week. We're going to have hearings Friday and Saturday it now appears. Looks as if it's going to go into the weekend. Look as if there will be almost two full days of hearings. The Senate Judiciary committee which will conduct the hearings is not going to issue a report, is not going to say he was telling the truth or that she was telling the truth or that we can't figure out. They're going to leave that to the Senate as a whole voting on Tuesday. I think that there are two questions that pre-occupy Washington tonight. One is, can he shake her story? Can he convincingly rebut what she has said about him? Number two, a correlated question, will other women come forward as is being hinted and say that they too were subjected by him to sexual harassment at some point in his career. 

Do you if there's anybody who has come forward like Professor Hill to corroborate her story, to suggest to the committee that they had similar experiences? 

We don't know of anybody who has come forward on that basis. We are told that there are one or two people who say that she told them this story months or years ago, which at least, Hanson suggest that this is not some fabrication of the last minute. There are also suggestions just beginning to bubble up that Clarence Thomas may have had an interest in pornographic movies for some time. One of the things that Anita Hill has said is that he like to talk to her about scenes that particularly interested him in pornographic movies. While there are other people who say they are going to testify or say they're going to submit affidavit saying that he has always been a porno movie fan. Whether that matters at all with regard to his qualifications for the Supreme Court, I think it's a moot question. But the point is that it's going to go into this brew that is steaming away on the Hill. 

There's great anticipation, obviously. Will they face each other? Will they testify at the same time or at separate times? 

My expectation is that they will testify sequentially. Whether they will be in the hearing room at the same time, I don't know although that's certainly possible. 

Is there odds in Washington tonight about the likelihood of Judge Thomas being confirmed? 

I think the general view in Washington is that the odds are slightly against him. That is not my view. My view is that the odds are slightly in his favor. But clearly, it's a very delicately balanced, delicately poised question and we'll have to wait and see what emerges in the hearings, in the two days of hearings before we make a very intelligent judgment. 

I thank you for joining us on this program live tonight from New York. 

Pleasure. 

RW Apple, Jr., the national correspondent for The New York Times joining us from Washington where he writes about national affairs for the Times. As we said, switchboards literally up the capital today as thousands of women call to express their outrage at the handling of the storm surrounding nominee, Clarence Thomas. Why has this issue mobilized women in the way that few others have? We'll talk about that now with former congresswoman, Bella Abzug, Lynn Hecht Shafran, an attorney for the NOW Legal Defense fund and Tony Brown, he's a journalist and former Dean of Communications at Howard University. Thank you all for joining us. Let me start with you, former congresswoman Bella Abzug. What happened today? Why do you think this incident, and it's not a question of whether Judge Thomas did or not, but it seems to be the thing that ignited the storm was the way it was handled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Do you share that? 

No question about it. Gender was showing. I think women, of course the country in particular, but also men, are quite outraged that this was regarded as trivial, unimportant, of no significance and totally ignored. Most people who have been in the workplace have had many such experiences. I think women especially felt very strongly that the Senate conducted itself in a very bad way and that they were acting like men who had no concern for the needs and rights of women. 

Are you surprised? 

Not at all. 

It's the male politicians that you knew in Washington>? 

Yes. That's what they were like. These questions of no concern to them. Either they identify with actions like this being okay because they may have engaged in them. Or, they're too self-conscious to deal with complaints of women. 

Let me tell you their defense though. As you know, their defense is that it was handled this way, Senator Mitchell, who you admire I assume, the Senate Majority leader says that Joe Biden handled it well, the chairman of the Judiciary committee. He also says, they were in a bind because she had asked that her name not be disclosed. They didn't think, and they respected her privacy. 

What does that have to do with their failure to talking to him whether he ever had anybody complain about him or was he aware of any such acts that might have taken place. There were ways to discuss the issue. Their general demeanor wasn't very intense to begin with. I think they let him off the hook on lots of things. But to totally obliterate this as though it did not exist is inexcusable. I think the women in this country will not forget it and they now realize that a Senate that has 2% women is something that has to go. 

Does not reflect America. 

It certainly doesn't. 

Ms. Schafran, what do you think of the way this has exploded on the nomination of Clarence Thomas? 

I think two things. The first is that I hope that it gives women a sense of what power they have when they finally decide to use it. This is truly an extraordinary happening that on the 11th hour, or maybe 11.59 hour before a vote on the Supreme Court nominee, the women of America could make it stop. That's a very important reality, a new reality. I also want to say with respect to the process, that I was absolutely shocked by the fact that quite apart from whether this woman's name was to have been kept confidential on a public basis, the committee never invited her to speak to them privately. According to what I read in the papers, many of the Senators didn't even bother to read her affidavit. In terms of blowing it off, I can't think of anything more obvious than that. 

It says to you --? 

That they don't think that this is a real issue, that they don't think this is serious. I heard many news commentators, male commentators talk about the fact that they think that when these Senators saw Professor hill on television, they were very disturbed because they suddenly realized that they had brushed off an individual of great respect and dignity and credibility. 

Is there anything that bothers you that this might be, might be because of his own vigorous denial, unfair to Judge Thomas, that he may be and his opportunity to be on the Supreme Court, may be washed over because of the way this has been handled and it may be unfair to him? 

I think it was unfair to everybody in the process. It was unfair to Professor Hill. It was unfair to Judge Thomas. It was unfair to the American public. I have been involved in judicial selection, federal and state, for more than a decade. I have been involved in situations where people who are up for judgeships were allegedly engaging in sexual harassment. I have seen proper investigations of this in the past. It doesn't have to happen this way. 

Private Brown, you're a new Republican, recently announced. I suspect you kn ow Clarence Thomas. 

I don't think this is a partisan. 

So is Professor Hill by the way. You have something in common with Professor Hill. 

A Republican, right. 

Yes, very conservative. 

She's a conservative and proud of the Reagan administration (inaudible 00:13:02) and so on. 

I think, first of all, we have to keep two things in perspective. The rights of women are very, very important. I think it's very important that the Senate, the Congress, the Supreme Court represent women. I also think it's very important that the Supreme Court represent black people and other people as well as white males. But I think it's important to separate the fact that there are legitimate grievances about the conduct of the committee. But that's separate from the character. The fact that we're simply dealing with allegations about Judge Thomas. I don't think we should brush him with everything that has happened, or every injustice that women in this country suffer. I think those are two separate issues. 

He has some other problems with women in terms of his past history a a chair of EEOC and the Office of Civil Rights. 

That's opinion. 

No, not opinion, those are facts. 

No, no, that's your opinion. 

The attempt to narrow the scope of the protection under the Office of Civil Rights. 

That is not a fact. That is not a fact. That is not a fact. What this woman said is true. Another woman who worked with her says she was telling the truth, that she was on a very close basis with him. 

I just want to make two points. One is that he has a history as far as -- these are facts. He narrowed the scope of the discriminate cases affecting women and their rights. 

When he was Chairman of the EEOC- 

Before that, when he was head of the Office of Civil Rights. Then, when he was Chairman of the EEOC, he really opposed a firmer action for women and the people protection laws and so on. That's a matter of history. It's a matter of history. I only said that to you because you said, there's no evidence that he was being unfair to women. I'm suggesting to you that there is (record 00:14:45). 

No, I did not say that. I did not say that. I said it's unfair to confuse the issue- 

I'm not confusing it. 

Of justice with women of what he did. I did not say that. 

The second thing that is involved and I think this is really the crux of it too. There's no question that the behavior of the Senate Committee is reprehensible. But also, I think the issue is one of character and in determining whether or not somebody should ascend to the Supreme Court, I think character has to be questioned. 

I don't think anybody is debating that but there are no facts here. We must speak with focus. These are allegations. 

There are allegations. 

There's a real problem here with this issue of character testimony. When you try a sexual harassment case, you do not bring in character witnesses. When the theologian, Paul (Telleck 00:15:23) died, a man eminently respectable. His wife opened up his desk drawers and found that they were filled with photographs of naked women bound and chained to crosses. This was his little fetish. Alfred Hitchcock, whom we all love and adore and see on television all the time, was a terrible harasser of women. The fact that you could get someone in to say that Clarence Thomas or Professor Hill has a fine public character is truly irrelevant. One of the things that I understand the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to do, which is a grave mistake I believe, is allow to bring in character witnesses, which is just right off the point. 

I don't know if you heard (inaudible 00:15:58) Senator Biden this morning, announcing something that sounded a little like a lynching. That is any woman, anywhere in the universe who wants to complain against Senator Thomas, call me at my 1-800 number. He didn't literally say that. Let's come in and complain about this guy. Anybody that wants to smear him, let's do it. I just think that that's stepping over the boundaries. I think we ought to keep this in focus. The rights of women are legitimate. Whether or not he is fit to serve is legitimate. But let's not confuse that with all of these dirt and then blame these allegations for everything that is wrong with women in this country. 

Let me just understand you, Tony. Are you saying that if there was someone, remove it even from Judge Thomas for a second, if there was someone who, after an issue like this, had become such a part of the public consciousness, if there was someone else for whatever reason that had agreements that was legitimate but had not disclosed it that they should not now come forward and disclose it and could add to the question of him- 

I'm not saying that. I'm not saying the woman doesn't have a right to come forward. I wonder why she waited it 10 years to do it. I wonder why she invited him to speak last year four times. I wonder why she, according to Senator Danforth, she's continually been phoning him. I wonder why all of these things. I don't know anything and none of us does. There are only two people who knows what goes on. That's Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. 

What do you think? We want to know. 

No. I'm not going to think because I don't think that's the issue. I think after the Senate goes through this circus, it's still going to be Thomas said and Hill said. You still aren't going to have any defendants with a smoking gun. To deny the man the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman makes allegations is flimsy at best. There are a lot of other good reasons (crosstalk 00:17:41). 

I will say that you're going to have a little more than that because there does seem to be contemporaneous corroboration. We've read in the paper that there is someone who, a woman who is now a judge on the West Coast as yet unnamed, who I believe was a law school classmate of Professor Hills and to whom she confided in 1981. Again, this is all- 

There's a woman who work with her and Thomas who says that this woman knew her well. He'll say, she didn't know her at all. This woman says that he;'ll have more than a professional interest in Thomas. Then, there are people who work with him, one man said, he picked up a Penthouse magazine and Thomas chastised him for buying the magazine, you're going to have Yays and Nays but you're not going to have any defendant with a smoking gun. 

I think you're going off in a different direction than what is clearly evident here. 

What's the right direction? 

I think that what we -- You raised a very interesting question. You said, this woman did it was 10 years ago, she's spoken to him since then, she's invited him to speak and so on. Of course, we heard this ad nauseam from Senator Hatch and Thomas' sponsors. They were indicting her on the Senate floor, which is totally inexcusable. That is not their role. The question of a 10-year period, anybody that's read or is familiar or handles sexual harassment cases, or sexual abuse cases, or cases of rape even, know that the trauma of it has been so enormous that in many instances this is a normal pattern. A normal pattern which people do not talk about it, but this is a matter history. 

We also know that every woman who has charged someone with rape has not told the truth. I'm sure you know of the Tawana Brawley case. According to the grand jury, they said she was lying. Women have lied as well as men. Women don't have any hay hole with Anita. We are dealing with this allegation that comes up and not trying to prove one side the other. 

That's exactly what Senator Hatch was suggesting. You're attacking this woman because of- 

I am attacking the absence of fact, not this woman. The woman has offered no facts. 

The committee had questioned her. She gave him an affidavit. 

So did he. He gave an affidavit. We have affidavit for affidavit. 

Let the Senate Committee decide after a hearing as to what the evidence shows. But what are doing is trying to condemn this woman who is the victim. 

You are trying to condemn him without any evidence. 

I'm not condemning him. 

You are. 

I haven't condemned him, not on that basis. I want you to know in advance that I disagree that he should be confirmed for a lot of good reasons. 

I know you do. The people without don't him confirmed because of this was- 

Okay. Hold on. 

Because he hasn't been straightforward, because he's been evasive, because it's totally implausible to believe that a law student- 

What you really don't like about him is he's a conservative Republican and he's not a Liberal. 

Not at all. 

Tony Brown, Bella Abzug, Lynn- 

It's inconceivable- 

Thank you Bella. 

That a person who went to law school -- Can I just finish this one thing? 

No, I'm out of time. Thank you very much. 

It wouldn't matter what she says. You wouldn't like him because he doesn't belong to your plantation. 

Thank you. 

We will be back. Stay with us and we'll meet Terrence
