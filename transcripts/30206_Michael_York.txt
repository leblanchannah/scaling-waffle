autobiography due in the spring, it is called "Accidentally on Purpose." We are pleased to have Michael York here. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

I should say straight from the theater you came, and I was just saying are you being kind to Mr. Miller, Arthur Miller, who wrote "The Crucible," and you said boom? 

Well he wasn't tonight and we very nearly didn't get here tonight, because Mr. Miller wanted to see his cast afterwards. And we were all very attentive and very anxious to have his report. 

Sure. And what did he say? 

He was complimentary and he was critical, which was very helpful. 

What did he say critically? 

Well, I mean, useful things. 

About the performances or about the overall construction of it? 

No, about the performances. It's a long play and it's full of moments, but the momentum is maybe even more important. But the nicest thing I heard, a friend of mine came around to see me tonight and she said, "Do you know, I sat next to Arthur Miller in the performance and he was crying at the end." So I thought, oh, well maybe we're doing something right. 

Did you know he was there during the performance? 

No, thanks God. No. 

Yeah, it would have made you nervous, would it? 

I think it might, yes. Yes. Yes, this is - it's a great play and a great - 

A great playwright. 

Exactly, although maybe not honored in this country as much as he is in mine. 

Is he appreciated more in your country? 

Well, I mean, his new plays are done at the National Theater, you know, "The Ride Down Mt. Morgan." 

Right. And here we do "Death of a Salesman." 

Sure, yes. 

You know, we do the old ones. 

Maybe, but it's interesting that you have - you know, because he's so great that, you know, he has a complete international kind of spectrum. He's capable of interpretation all over the world. 

Why do you think that is that he's more appreciated there in London than he is in - 

Don't ask me. It's a kind of syndrome. It happened with Tennessee Williams. It seemed the critics got mad. They wrote him off and he refused to lie down and die, and kept on writing. And they got mad as hell about that. 

There is a thing about us in terms - that we, even when people achieve greatness, we don't necessarily accept their newer works. It happens with songwriters. It happens with playwrights occasionally. 

I think it's to do with the pendulum of taste and fashion, don't you? And if you wait long enough, all of us, you know, you'd swing out and swing in again. You know, as long as there is momentum. 

You were in one of - Tennessee selected you early on and there was some reason you had some reservation about doing it, didn't you, for some role? And you said this is Tennessee Williams, of course I'm going to do it. 

Oh, no. I said immediately. It was like a royal command when he asked me to be in one of his last great plays, "Out Cry," a two-hander here on Broadway, oh, in the early 70s. 

And you said, "I'm thrilled. Absolutely, yes." 

Well it would have been like lèse-majesté to have said no to one of the great playwrights writing in your language. And it was a fascinating experience, of course, because we were on the road and living in each other's pockets, to have an insight into that teeming imagination. 

Yeah. You got to know him well? 

Very well. He became a good friend, I'm happy to say. And the book, which you mentioned, I have managed - I kept some of his letters and they're wonderful. 

Yeah, he was a prolific letter writer, was he not? 

Yes, he was a great - 

Because there was a woman who was a great friend of his, who you know and whose name I've forgotten. 

The Lady Maria St. Just. 

Yes. Yes. 

Who used to live in - still lives in Belgrade, around the corner from where I used to live, who is indeed his literary executrix. 

Yeah. And he wrote tons of letters to her and she wrote about the correspondence. 

She was the five o'clock angel, four o'clock angel, whatever it was. Yes. 

Yes. 

Wonderful book. 

I look at your life and I read about you, and it seems to be a charmed life. Is it for you? I mean, do you sense that because you go from performance to performance, you're on stage, you're on film, you're on television, you seem to be consistently working, you travel around the world, you have a lovely wife, family? 

I'm going to burst into tears. 

You do. You want - you should burst into prayer. 

You're right, Charlie. I have - 

It does seemed charmed life for you. 

Well I've been extremely lucky. But in terms of, you know, pendulum swings, one's been in and out and up and down, and that's I think the natural way of things. And life is a kind of wave pattern. 

Is it the career you imagined when you were at Oxford, one, or, two, when you were performing, you know, at the Old Vic or the National or the Royal Shakespeare, wherever you performed? 

I didn't have any precepts or blueprint, and I think this is the fascination of the job, that there is absolutely nothing - you go in and it's anarchy. You create whatever you want. Even the days of the studios where you used to sign on and you were, you know, kind of an employee, you had a certain kind of tenure, there was a certain kind of security. There isn't anymore, and it's both frightening and exhilarating. So whatever career you have, it's your responsibility. I like it because I'm a highly independent person. But, you know, I'm forever grateful for the opportunity to work. And I think maybe I work more than - maybe other actors are more selective. 

You might choose more roles simply because you want to continue working? 

I'd rather rue the sins of commission than omission. And I think you learn - 

Said well. 

Well you never know. And also, there's a total double standard. You know, there's the artistic one, but there's also the living one. You may go off and do a film, you know, which is an absolute kind of horror, artistically it doesn't turn out, no one plans it this way. The beginning of every venture you try and - everyone tries to kind of grab the golden ring to do the best thing. But it doesn't always work that way and there's no reason for it. But, on the other hand, you may have gone to some extraordinary country. I mean, I was in Czechoslovakia, for example, just before coming here, which was - I don't know how the film - 

After the revolution, yeah. 

Well it's all - 

Right, and so you had a chance to see a nation - 

I wanted to go there to see - 

-- and a poet president. 

Sure. I saw a film about an arms dealer, which is one of the interesting things about Czechoslovakia, one of the great viable industries of course must be a kind of a embarrassment to a liberal human - 

What was the film? 

It was the first Slovak film, so it wasn't Czech. 

Yeah, so this is a film made - Slovak? 

Slovak, yes, you have to say this because it's a very touchy subject at the moment. You know, there is a Slovak nation, there is a Czech nation. And we were in Bratislava, not Prague, at a fascinating time because working with people who used to be state employees. That was a state industry. There wasn't anymore. This was the first kind of coproduction, the first capitalistic venture. 

The exhilaration of artistic freedom. 

Oh, yes. Yes, you sense it there. And it was an interesting - the Velvet Revolution was - 

Now, is this a good film? Do you like it? Or is this one of those that you made and you said, "Look, I do this because it takes me to Prague and to Belgrade? 

No, I like the script. It was a director friend of mine who's a kind of genius. 

Who is that? 

Peter Patzak. 

Yeah. 

His films are shown in the festivals here. Hasn't yet kind of hit through here, but I think will, maybe with this one. 

Do you learn a lot - you worked with Richard Burton. 

Mm-hm. 

You were with Sir Laurence Olivier, I don't know if you - were you in a performance with him? 

I was in his company, yes. I was never on stage with him, which I regret. 

But you trained - there was a great story about you'd be exercising there in his company I guess and he'd be next to you doing pushups or something, is that a true story? 

Oh, sure. I mean, in fact, I joined the company the same day as Sir Ian McKellen, who was with you the other night. Yes, those were heady days. In fact, glory days in a way. Extraordinary things were happening. It was a fledgling company, which is not an indispensable part of the cultural life of the nation. That's why I think Tony Randall's thing is - 

Yeah, and I asked that question of Tony and he didn't give me quite - we didn't have a chance to explore it as much. This notion of the role of theater in the culture and in the consciousness of a nation, and in the development of a nation, and as a place where great ideas are played out on stage, you know, and where ideas that go against the grain are presented. And it seems to me or at least some people argue that that tradition is more nourished and protected and encouraged at least, with some marvelous exceptions here, it is more nourished in your country than here. Do you think that's true? It's not a criticism of the American theater to say it. It has something to do with a longer tradition and perhaps also because of the support with the government. 

Possibly. All I know, whatever tradition we have theatrically or linguistically, is yours, too. I mean, we're talking about - 

A common language. 

Yes. And Arthur Miller. And we have - Tony, of course, couldn't say it because I think he's a modest person, but he's doing something extraordinary. It needs someone with a kind of mad genius, you know, Sam Wanamaker with his - 

Obsession. 

An obsession to do this. It needs, you know, Diaghilev to be the kind of midwife. And I think he's done it because it's one thing putting on the plays, and as you were saying earlier to Jacques and Gerald, it's also to make them accessible. You know, students can get in for ten dollars for these performances, which is at it should be because I think we also have the responsibility to create audiences because this thing has made for a strange kind of audience. You know, you notice in the cinema, people talk among themselves. They're used to sitting at home and discussing what they're seeing. 

Yeah, they do. There's a lot of noise when you go to a film. 

Oh, it's appalling. I often feel that there shouldn't be a "No Smoking" notice, there should be "No Talking." 

"No Talking," be quiet and listen and watch. 

And in a way the experience, the theatrical experience of, you know, seeing great ideas through the prism of actors, you know, in the open is - it might be lost to us, which seems unthinkable. 

Who's had the most influence on you as an actor? Who's been profound in terms of an impact? 

Well, I mean, we had this - this pantheon of gods when I was a young actor. 

Gielgud and Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson and - 

Of course. 

Burton and - 

Yeah, and Guinness and so on. 

And Alec Guinness. 

And I suppose the two were - 

God, when you think about all those people in one generation almost, it's just extraordinary. 

Sure. When you think of my good friend, proud kind of a friend, John Gielgud, who is the youngest person I know. 

Even though he's what? 

85. His new film is out. He's the - the last time I had tea with him he was pacing up and down because he'd been out of work for three weeks, and he's young and vital. And, you know, the marvelous thing it shows that as you grow older, as long as you have your wits and enthusiasm, your range changes. You know, there he is, with crowns and pearls and whatever, and yet along comes "Prospero's Books." 

Yeah, I just saw it's over on 57th Street. Now, "Accidentally on Purpose," how did you get that title? I got 30 seconds for the biography - or for the memoir. 

Because Simon & Schuster hated my English title. 

Which was? 

It's out in "Traveling Player." They drew a blank at that. 

Because they didn't think it would ring with an American audience? 

I don't know. My English publishers hated, "Accidentally on Purpose," so I said oh well. 

Now is it out in England? 

It's out, yes. 

So you've written this, but it's waiting a publication date in the United States. 

Yes. 

And when will that be? 

In March. 

Oh, terrific. And was it cathartic for you? Was it - 

Kind of, yes. Yes. It wasn't a summing up. And at first I resisted. 

It's just a life in process. 

Yes. It's a pit stop on route. 

Nice to have you. 

Thank you. 

I think you for coming because I think if Arthur Miller was coming to see me I would have been tempted to say let Rose fend for himself. Thank you very much. 

Thank you. 

I thank everybody who joined us tonight. Tomorrow night, an hour of great conversation I guess will include Pete Hamill of the New York Post, Ken Auletta talking about the networks, and the legendary guitar of Les Paul. Join us then.
