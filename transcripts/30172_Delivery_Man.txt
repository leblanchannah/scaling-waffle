"The Sense of an Ending" is a new film adapted from Julian Barnes' 2011 novel of the same name. Jim Broadbent stars as a man who's forced to reevaluate his life as he looks back at some of the most crucial relationships of his youth. "Variety" writes: "The film offers a poignant commentary on how each of us attempts to make meaning of our lives." Here's a look at the trailer. (DOORBELL RINGING) 

Oh, good morning. Could you, uh, sign here please? There. 

All right. 

All right, have a nice -- day. (MUSIC) 

Dear Tony, I think it right that you should have the attached, and perhaps you'll find it an interesting, if painful, memento of long ago. 

Mrs. Ford's will describes the item as a diary. 

A diary? 

He's company with Mrs. Ford's daughter. 

Veronica. 

Hello. 

Hello, Anthony. (MUSIC) 

Veronica and I were together. 

Boyfriend and girlfriend? 

Exactly, yes. Then in my school days, I met my best friend. Tony Webster. 

I'm Adrian Finn. 

Not long after, Veronica formed a relationship with him. (MUSIC) I wrote them both a very nasty letter. 

What do you think you'll find in the diary? (MUSIC) This is horrible. 

My best friend mysteriously died. Who is to blame for this event? 

Something is certainly going on. 

What is it? What is going on? 

You're on your own now. (MUSIC) 

What you end up remembering isn't always what you actually witnessed. It was an accident! 

Legally, yes. Morally, no. 

So, what were you doing there? (MUSIC) 

We may never know the truth. (MUSIC) 

Are we going to address the fact that almost everything you've told me in the last few days, you've told me for the very first time. What really strikes me is your total inability to see what's right under your nose, such as your daughter. (MUSIC) 

How often do we tell our own life story? (MUSIC) And do we adjust, embellish, make slight cuts, and create a new reality? (MUSIC) And when everything is coming off the rails... how were we to know that our lives would entwine... forever. 

And joining me now are two of the film's stars Jim Broadbent and Michelle Dockery. I'm pleased to welcome both of you to the table. Thanks for joining us today. 

Thank you. 

Jim, let me start with you because this is a book that won the Man Booker Prize. It's a well-known novel and a highly respected one. Not, I would think, an easy novel to turn into a movie. And it features in the starring role, your part, a character who his own daughter calls, gives the nickname Mudge to -- which I love, short for curmudgeon -- not the most likable guy in the world. 

No, it's one of the things that drew me to it. He's a difficult man. And he's a rather self-centered man. And he claims he's happily divorced which doesn't really ring true. But he thinks he is. And he's living a rather selfish life with his own, in his own retirement. And his hobby of running a little camera shop. But then, this legacy comes from the mother of his lost love, first girlfriend, which throws his life into turmoil. And he actually finds out, I think through that, and we find out, that he's not as happy and as content as he claims to be. 

The film makes the point -- and you say as the narrator in the film, that we all, in the course of our lives, end up writing our own stories, and sometimes not very accurately. 

Yes, the stories we tell ourselves are the stories we told ourselves first. So they get Chinese whispers. They become more and more remote from what really happened, I think. And he's convinced himself that he's all right, but when you dig a bit deeper, it all, more is revealed. 

It's interesting because he has -- he has this little shop, this little camera shop, it's like a hole in the wall. I actually love that little space, although I can't imagine how you would spend the whole day there. But it's almost like a metaphor for his life. There is one customer that comes in and he kind of scurries him out. And apart from his ex-wife who sort of prods him, the only real relationship he has is with his daughter, Michelle. 

Yes. 

But we don't actually know a lot about you in the film. 

We don't, and I love that. That Susie is -- it's a bit of a mystery, you know. Who is the father of this child that she is about to have? And I love that about the film, that there are certain things within it that are unanswered. Which it leaves the audience, you know, it's for the audience to decide, you know. But they are both at a point in their lives, I think, you know, where things are about to change quite drastically. I mean certainly for Susie, but also for Tony. You know, he's about to become the grandfather, and Margaret. And I think that it's, you know, whether it is sort of consciously in there, you know, whether Nick Payne and you know, the producers actually kind of put it in there that she was expecting a child, I mean, it's very different from the book because, of course, she's married with two children. But it kind of all builds to that point, doesn't it, toward the end. And, of course, this discovery and this journey that he goes on to unravel the past and the truth, it builds to this moment which then connects them as a family. 

Right. 

In a very -- in a different way than before, you know. 

There is a moment almost when he becomes -- when Tony becomes like a different person. I mean, it all suddenly opens up for him. 

Yes. It's beautifully constructed in Julian Barnes' novel and is taken into the film as well. The balance of the school days of being a school boy, and then the adults, but the school days and the history lessons, particularly, and I identified with the school completely. I identified with Tony Webster from the word go, we're exactly the same age, exactly the same cultural background, all boys school, formed a bit of a clique of four or five of us who thought we were cleverer than anyone else, all that fairly unpleasant school boy behavior. And it transpires, really, when older Tony's life gets thrown into turmoil, that he hasn't changed much. He hasn't -- he's got older, but he perhaps hasn't grown up, hasn't really matured. He's still the slightly lost child, boy trying to find love and stumbling and tripping over people and being rather unpleasant and rude. And I love the fact that as adults, we don't actually know everything, and that we're still struggling with life. 

One of the things I was struck by in watching this film, and I'm often struck by watching British films or TV series, is that they're unafraid to go more slowly through a story, and to let you feel it more. 

Yes. 

I mean I don't know if you notice that as actors in making films. 

Certainly in this one. 

Certainly this one, yes, yes. 

Ritesh allowed a lot of time. He's a very patient man anyway, but he also has a patience, I think, with making the film, he allows us to take our time. 

Does that change the acting experience? 

I mean, I certainly felt very relaxed on set, you know, from the get-go. It just felt like a very calm, just being allowed to kind of breathe, actually. And you feel that when you're watching it. The first time I watched the film, I thought, it's so wonderful to watch a film where there are moments of, where you can kind of take a breath, where it all kind of slows down. 

Sometimes almost nothing happens, but something is happening in that nothingness. 

Exactly. And also it allows the audience to form their own opinion of that moment. 

Sometimes I worry we've become so -- we're so worried we're going to lose people's attention that we're, we're afraid to even just stop and let something pause for a moment. 

I think that's a very good point. I was completely in it when I watched it. And actually on the page it felt very -- because, of course, you're jumping from the past to present. There were moments I thought how are they going to do this. And even if in the theatrical trailer, how they kind of split the screen, the editing is just amazing. And you never once kind of go, oh, hold on a second, where are we? Which world are we in? It's very, very clear, and yet on the page, it's quite a complicated plot in a way. 

Yes. I'm struck in having the two of you here that you are known, or you have become known in such a different fashion through your careers. You're known because of one part, Lady Mary, which everybody knows you as. And Jim, you've never really had one part that defined you. 

No, there has been one. 

I don't know what is the better course for an actor. 

Certainly, Michelle's is best for her. (LAUGHTER) 

It's worked really well both ways. 

Yes. 

I mean, you did have one extraordinary year, I mean, in 2001, where you won the Oscar, you won for "Iris," you've won the BAFTA, the British Film Award for "Moulin Rouge!" And you also were in "Bridget Jones's Diary." Did that effectively change your life that year? 

I suppose it did, yes. And I think the beginning of that process was the film "Topsy-Turvy," that was the first time I got an award. 

The Gilbert and Sullivan film. 

Yes, I played Gilbert. And that was the first time I got an award. And after that you're sort of awardable, after you get one. That was in Venice. All right, we are allowed to award him. 

Is it true? (LAUGHTER) 

That was a wonderful spread. And then "Gangs of New York" wasn't far after that. 

Yes. 

So that was, that all came together. But I think the, probably if there is one job that really changed how I was perceived, I think it might have been getting a part in Woody Allen's "Bullets over Broadway" because that was at that time, for a Brit actor to be in a Woody Allen film was very unusual. And it was so exciting to -- oh, Woody Allen likes him, that was a door opening, a job opening. 

The success of "Downton Abby" was -- did it take you by surprise? 

It did. And nothing can prepare you for that. I mean, we all felt we were on to something exciting. And it was a script that, you know, friends of mine had heard about and were reading for. And, of course, it was Julian, and Hugh had already been cast, and Maggie, so it was exciting from the very start. But you never, you can never predict how an audience will take it. 

It just seemed to build, it kept building. 

Yes. And then, of course, when it hit America, everything changed. And that seemed to be -- 

What changed? 

-- overnight. Well, I mean for me it was being suddenly recognized and, you know, that was a huge change for me. 

What is that feeling like? 

Well, it's amazing and terrifying at the same time. 

Sure. 

But it really depends where, to me, it depends where I am, it still does now. I mean, I can go completely unnoticed in some parts of the world or the country, and it all depends on like when the show is airing, you know, obviously, we're recognized more. But it's not something I would ever complain about because it has brought, you know, so much, you know, to my life, and my career going forward. And has opened so many doors, and they don't come along very often -- 

That's true. I think some people don't realize it at the time you think you're going to have another one and you don't always. 

I never take that for granted. 

Was it -- you spent six years in the end. 

Six years, yes. 

Which is a long time. 

Yes, it is. And we became like family. And, of course, you are living your life alongside, you know, you lived with the character. And your life is going alongside it. And things change for people and -- 

Did you have enough time to prepare for the ending of something like that, or is there a sort of -- 

It's funny because I did this film right after "Downton," and the title, "The Sense of an Ending." 

Oh wow. 

Yes, it was a month later, we wrapped on "Downton" and then I started this. Yes, I mean anticipation building up to those last few weeks, you know, we were devastated to let it go. But it felt like the right time. 

Yes. I get the sense that both of you always wanted to be actors, yes? 

I did really, and it took a while to own up to it. I went to art school for a year but then I realized that wasn't what I wanted to do. If I was honest with myself, I really wanted to act. So I knew really, yes. 

You did. 

Yes, I did too. I knew very young. 

You went to drama school, didn't you? 

I did, yes. And I went to a stage school, a local stage school from the age of five. And it was, you know, a hobby that my parents found for us, me and my sisters, for our confidence and to make friends, you know, other friends outside of school. 

Did it work? 

It did. And so, I was dance -- I was dancing and singing, it was more sort of a musical theater route that I could have gone down. 

Yes. 

But when I was 16, I had an encouraging drama teacher when I was doing my GCSE's around 16. And she really encouraged me, in fact, she wrote all my applications for drama school. And then that was it, I went to drama school and I knew I was hooked. 

You get into it drama school, you think I'm home. 

Yes. 

This is the world I want to be in. 

I think being part of an ensemble in a group of actors. 

And everybody loves what you love. 

Yes, that was it. I knew I was home. 

Would you ever do Broadway? 

I would. I'd love to. 

Would you? 

Yes, I'm actually dying to get back on stage because it's been five years. 

You played Eliza Doolittle, but not in "My Fair Lady," in "Pygmalion." 

Yes. 

They're casting a new "My Fair Lady" at Lincoln Center, if you're interested. 

I'll give my agent a call. I would, yes, I'm itching to get back. 

Yes. 

And so, yes. 

And you've done a lot of theater too, Jim. 

I did. I did a tremendous amount to start with. And I made a decision not to do theater until I got used to cameras. Until I wasn't frightened by the camera. 

Were you initially frightened by it? 

Yes. 

I was the same. 

I thought I've got to do enough, so I forget about it. And that sort of led into doing more and more films. And now theater's been more sporadic. But I did "Scrooge" Christmas before last. I mean, you have to keep it going, or it'll get a bit rusty. 

They feel so different to me, I've always -- 

They are. And I felt the same. I felt like I did theater for a long time before "Downton" and had done a few, you know, TV, small TV roles. But it was, I found it very intimidating at first, you know, the cameras and the crew. And because I had spent so long doing theater, so I feel like I'm at that point now where I'm used to it. 

When did you figure out how to carve up a roll into very small little parts that you did over the course of three months of shooting as opposed to one night in a performance? Because that is what I always marvel at. How you come in and out of character so quickly in between all that chaos around you. 

It took getting used to for me. I am going from theater to television, I found it, because of course for three hours, you're playing the character, you know, constantly, and you are only nipping on and off stage for a change or whatever. But having those hours in between, I found that I have gotten used to it now. But I do find it hard and kind of having less control, actually. Because when you are on stage, you have the control. But anything can happen on a set. 

When you are filming, the easiest bit is when the camera is going and you are filming and you have got something to do. And that's why you are there. And all you have to do is make it sound as real as possible and get in character and make it sound natural and real. But there is so much hanging around, a lot of -- the boredom can really do your head in, really. 

Yes. 

You can go in for a whole day and not be used because of the things that have gone wrong technically. 

Yes. 

And you have to -- that is the challenge. Keeping that patience and -- 

And keeping that energy. Like even though you have, if someone, you know, comes over and says I'm sorry, but you are not going to be used for another four hours, I find it difficult, you know, read a book or watch the TV or have a nap because I need to keep up that energy. 

Right. Good luck to you both. Michelle Dockery, Jim Broadbent, thanks for being here. The film is "The Sense of an Ending." It opens in theaters March 10th.
