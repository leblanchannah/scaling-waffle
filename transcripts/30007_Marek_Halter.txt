In Moscow, they're still trying to figure out the implications of the dismissal of the Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov. Boris Yeltsin fired him yesterday. There has been much talk about what it means for Russia and what it means for the stability of that country. Joining me this evening, two people who know Yevgeny Primakov. They are Mort Zuckerman, the editor-in-chief of U.S. News and World Report and Marek Halter who is editor-in-chief of The French News and has two French universities in Moscow. Welcome to the broadcast. Nice to meet you. You two know each other for reasons that I don't know, but I got a call from a friend of mine who said we should talk to you because you had an interesting relationship with Primakov. 

Right. We met in '69, Cairo, when I went to see the president Nasser with a message of (inaudible), and then I met a man who was waiting to see Nasser to interview him for the Russian Pravda newspaper, and this was Yevgeny Primakov. And we became very good friends. He is half a Jew. His mother was a Jew, and he was very interested in Israel. Many people told me later that he was the chief on the KGB for this region. Maybe this is true, and when he became the prime minister, I think I was one of the first in the west to know it because he saw me, he told me you can tell me mazel tov because I became a prime minister which is very nice for a prime minister of the Russian Empire. 

And so then there was another call that came at the time you wrote a piece in France in opposition to the American bombing, and he called you on the phone? 

Right. This is now in the beginning of the bombing -- I am against Milosevic for sure. He's a criminal, but I told that the bombing was not the best way to fight against the regime. This is certainly not the best way to protect populations. We have (inaudible) refugees to that, so I wrote an article in The French Press. It was reproduced in different newspapers in Europe and the title was only "No," but in French, and then he found me. He found me. He told me, listen, your article is very courageful. I know that all your intellectual friends saw the bombing, supported the bombing. Please, if you have some time I would like to speak to you, and I took the plan and I went to Moscow to see. I met and interviewed with him. It was also published in many papers, and he said to me what was this was published in all the world. He said, listen, you know to play chess? I said yes. He said you know that before you are doing something you have to understand the strategy of your enemy. I said yes. So, why in the west no politician knows to play chess? 

Someone once said about someone else that while they're playing checkers, we're playing chess. I forgot where that came from. 

While they're playing chess, we're playing checkers. 

You know Primakov from what background? And you were, as I remember, planning to host a gathering of journalists and others to meet him during the visit that was postponed because of the bombing. 

I met him in 1985 when he was the head of an institute in Moscow, a think tank, and we remained not close friends but friendly ever since, and when he became prime minister he sent around a representative to assess what it would take to get further funding support from the IMF. That person came to see me and I spent about two hours with him, was quite negative about it, and very shortly thereafter got a call from Primakov's office to come and see him and talk to him about this, which I did in January, and after a lot of dialogue over this issue went to see him again at the beginning of March, and when he was coming to the United States he asked me to see if I would organize a group of media people to whom he could speak what they call the mass media, and also to have a group of people who were not necessarily in the government but who were very seriously involved in Russia to give him some advice in counsel as to how to deal with his fiscal and monetary and economic problems. That was all arranged at the time that he turned around somewhere over Labrador and went back, so all of those meetings never took place, but I have been in constant touch either with him or with people who are very close to him for the last three or four months. 

A couple of things before we start now into the substance of this. Number one, it is that Yeltsin said faltering economy is one reason for firing him. Others have said that Yeltsin had fired him because he believed he was such a deep-seated communist and therefore wasn't on to the program and others have speculated there might have been other reasons having to do with his own impeachment. America, a lot of officials in the American government, I am told by one source or the other, have great reservations about Primakov. 

Well, for good reason. Yeltsin I think was somebody whom the United States had felt over a considerable period of time and based on a lot of experience of dealing with him essentially had made a fundamental decision that the future of Russia lay with the west. I don't know that Primakov had made that decision. In fact, my instinct about him was that he was as much anti-west as he was anything else. There was, for all kinds of reasons given his whole history I think he was very wary and suspicious of the west and still felt that kind of antagonism and competition, and I think this was something that affected his policy. Now I think with respect to his disagreements with Yeltsin, that was a part of it, but you had two major disagreements or variations in his approach vis-Ãƒ -vis. One was a matter of policy, particularly on economic policy and on his dealings with the communists. Yeltsin was viscerally anti-communist and one of the things that he was uncomfortable with was Primakov's closeness to the communists, but that extended into the policy realm in terms of economic reforms which the communists oppose which Yeltsin was in favor of and which Primakov handled by basically doing nothing, but the other and just as important was the issue of power and here is where it's not just the impeachment. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Yeltsin is seriously concerned, after all, his term of office is over sometime next year. He is seriously concerned over the fact that he and his family may be pursued for criminal and other shall we say violations of the public purse. His major ally in terms of the oligarchs so called is the man by the name of Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky and Primakov hated each other and Primakov was going after Berezovsky and, amongst other things, Primakov said about the impeachment, he didn't say that he thought it was an outrage and should be null and void, he said it's not the right time for it. Now, this is not exactly what the president wants to hear, so Yeltsin is particularly concerned that the man who succeeds him is going to be somebody who's going to protect he and his family, and I don't think he felt that way about Primakov, so sooner or later Primakov was going to be out. Now, I happen to know that the executive order to fire Primakov was signed on April 10. 

How do you know that? 

I know that. I can't tell you how I know it, I just know it and it was signed on April 10, and he kept it on his desk waiting for the moment to use it and it was going to be used if not before the impeachment then certainly after the impeachment because Yeltsin was concerned and it gets to be much more complicated. For example, they had Skuratov, who was their attorney general who had turned to somebody who was now opposing Yeltsin, and Primakov was very lukewarm about throwing Skuratov out and this made Yeltsin even more suspicious. Berezovsky got to Yeltsin directly through Tatyana, the daughter of Yeltsin, and he planted many seeds of doubt about Primakov given his (inaudible). So you had a whole circle of people who were intriguing to get rid of Primakov and Yeltsin was very susceptive to it because on the personal matters Primakov was not as supportive as Yeltsin would have liked. 

What do you think? I want to come back to these two questions a little bit later. Is this in the United States' interest or not in the United States' interest and, two, what does it mean in terms of the future, stability of Russia, and what might happen first, conversations about Primakov and why he was kicked out and what you know. 

Partly I agree to what Mort said, but only partly. I think that it is a mistake from Yeltsin's side because really he is thinking about his future, future of his family and so forth. Berezovsky bought them already a big house, a beautiful house in the south of France. 

Berezovsky bought it for the Yeltsin's? 

For sure. So this is normal, this is human life. The politicians are all human beings. 

This is normal by Russian standards, let's put it that way. 

The majority of the countries in the world, you know very few countries where you have really democracy and chief of the state when he is resigning. This is only a few countries in the world, but this is the reality, but really problem I think Primakov became one of the popular politicians because he understood economy as his laws, he has to (inaudible) how to set the rules, and he understood that he has nothing to give today that Russian people has no (inaudible), no jobs, and after all the Russians they are ready to support everything. You have told stories that you have two people who now support misery so good, the Jews and the Russians, and the Russians have no jobs, no heat, no nothing, and they can support other (inaudible) to make another revolution. That (inaudible) and he understood that. When he was in the plan to go to Washington to ask for money and then the middle he received a phone call from Vice President, Al Gore, who told him we are going to bomb Yugoslavia, he had stopped. I don't need your money, I'm going back, and he was applauded by 200 million people. 

Applauding? 

Applauded. 

Because of the huge animosity to the American bombing in Russia? 

Right. Not because he showed the world that the Russians exist, that they are power, they are ready to say no, they are not going to sell their soul for some dollars. This is very important. I think that Yeltsin was a little bit jealous of his popularity. 

Let me just state one more. Have you had any contact with Primakov in the last 24 hours or anyone close to him? 

No, I spoke with a man who is one of his best friends from (inaudible) and the time they were together at the university (inaudible), and he told me that Primakov knew that he was going to be fired for sure, but after all this was a shock for him, it was a shock, but he has already an ally with Luzhkov, who is the mayor of Moscow, and he's the best candidate of the future president. 

So they all join forces together, Primakov and Luzhkov? 

This is possible, yes. This is possible and then this will be a really political power. 

What do you think? Have you first of all had any contact with people that are either with Primakov or people around him? 

Yes, just this morning. I had a long conversation with him and basically what they said is that everybody is in a Kamikaze mode. It's a proverbial firing squad in a circle and nobody knows what the outcome of all of this is, the assessment as to why Yeltsin actually moved right now when he knew that Primakov's support in the Duma would then be shifted against him. It's a very interesting question. Nobody can quite figure this out. It could have happened in any kind of irrational way, Yeltsin could have been sitting around with a couple of his buddies and his daughter and they could have been having frankly too much to drink and said hey, let's just go ahead and do it, or they might have figured out that this was a way in effect to dissolve the Duma. This was Yeltsin's thinking 30 days ago. This is how I happen to know. Yeltsin actually decided to let Primakov go with the idea that he would appoint a succeeding prime minister who would not be approved by the Duma, and everybody knows that (inaudible) will not be approved by the Duma three times in a row, the Duma is automatically dissolved, and this might be the way that he protects himself from the impeachment process; however, it's very complicated. The Constitution doesn't make very much sense. If an impeachment process has been voted, he theoretically cannot dissolve the Duma, but then the impeachment process could be stopped at various other levels. So it's political chaos and it has enormous consequences for Russia frankly in economic terms because the IMF funding, which was really just a restructuring of their debt, they got no new money, that Primakov was involved with in the last several weeks was preconditioned on certain legislation that was going to be approved by the Duma. That's no longer going to be approved by the Duma, which means the IMF money is in doubt, which means the World Bank money is in doubt and so too is the Japanese money and the restructuring with the Paris and London pub, so Russia's financial condition may be going into total chaos. 

Alright. Before we get to that, you still have a newspaper in Russia? 

Yes. 

What's the attitude of the Clinton administration about this firing? Are they pleased? Do they think that on balance there are more negative than positive reasons? 

Well, as I say, I think the Clinton Administration was happy to have Chernomyrdin involved as the Russian representative on the Kosovo dialogue, on the dialogue with Milosevic. This I think is going to de-stabilize the government to the point that may diminish the effectiveness of Chernomyrdin, but I don't believe it will eliminate it. Russia will still play the key role in the mediation between Milosevic and the west because the fact is that the power always resided with the president. 

Well, who's going to do it though? 

Chernomyrdin. They were very happy that Primakov was out of that. You will recall that Primakov went to Belgrade, came up with a completely ridiculous proposal on the part of Milosevic, and then announced it as a constructive peace process which was something that was very heavily resented in NATO and in Washington. So, there is a real, I think -- 

But answer the question, do you think that the United States is pleased that Primakov has been dismissed? 

I think they prefer the current candidate and almost any other candidate. 

Than Primakov. So anything that led to the dismissal they would be pleased about, in your judgment? 

I think they prefer these - they like -- 

Not that you have necessarily a lot of sources in the American government, but are the French happy about it may be a better question. 

I don't believe that the Europeans are happy with the firing of Primakov because Primakov after all he said something interesting. He was looking for capitalism with a human face and we believe in Europe that capitalism with human face is European capitalism, so we told in Europe that you know Russia is always on the middle between (inaudible) in Europe. We have - interesting if the Europeans to have Russians with us, not with (inaudible), with Japan, Korea, China. 

You want Russia part of Europe rather than part of Asia? 

For sure. 

What's going to happen? Where do you think this is going to take - what's going to happen now? Duma will be disbanded and new elections will take place and we're going to see security forces that are under the command of former (inaudible) minister, now the nominee for prime minister up against other kinds of forces? 

Look, following upon what Marek said, one of the amazing things about the Russians is their ability to absorb punishment. We in the great depression had a decline in our GDP between 1929 and 1935 of about a third. Russia in the last seven years has had a decline in their GDP of 60%. It is the most catastrophic socioeconomic collapse of any major country in peace time in this century. 

And who do they blame for that? 

The interesting thing is there has not been a single demonstration, not a single march, not a single protest, not a rock thrown through a window, not a graffiti. The only thing that has occurred are occasional stripes for people who haven't been paying for months, that's it, so the Russian people are willing to absorb this. This, however, carries two risks. One is as in 1917 you could have a (inaudible) at the top, so a very small group can take over when you can't mobilize the mess, but there's one other group in the middle, which is the middle class, who did well, a small group, maybe 10% of the population who did well in the 1990s, and they have lost a great deal and that may provide the political soil to nourish some kind of upheaval. 

Does any political leader come out of this with bigger opportunities? 

Well, certainly Primakov came out of his tenure as prime minister with bigger political opportunities, if that is his goal. He has stated over and over again he doesn't want to be president. On the other hand, nobody believes him, but I think Luzhkov emerges, depending on how the election is held, that Luzhkov emerges as the best option. The problem with Luzhkov, who is the mayor of Moscow which has done fairly well, is that Moscow is now also beginning to 

And there are allegations of corruption. deteriorate economically. 

There are allegations of corruption. That is not unusual. 

What do you think is going to happen? 

It is difficult to know -- 

Churchill said. 

Whoever is saying what can be how to astonish us is always possible in Russia and this is what we are like in Russia when (inaudible), this is what we are looking for, to be astonished, and the Russians have not been able to astonish him. Today the two major politicians in Russia, Luzhkov and Primakov you have liberal politician who is very, very respected, has no problem with corruption, but Berezovsky he has too many possibilities because he is a Jew, but he was supporting Primakov which is very interesting. So, if you have -- 

But not now, not on the dismissal of Primakov. Yavlinsky said it was timely to have Primakov out because the delay in making the economic reforms was too costly to Russia. That's a very interesting development that came out. 

But if you have coalition between the three, Yavlinsky, Primakov, Luzhkov, this I think can be something very positive for the future of Russia. 

Can't you say at the end of the day that this creates instability and instability in Russia is not good for any of us? 

Absolutely. Compounds instability and what you have in Russia now is something that, to use a phrase that they're communist doctrinaires used, you have a withering away of the state, the essential state which we always were fearful was too strong is now too weak. The country that had all these nuclear weapons which we were fearful they would use, we're now fearful they will lose. That is a real concern that we have, that they will lose control over these nuclear weapons. Without them, frankly, we would be much less concerned. The instability there is now definitely compounded. 

But what he said (inaudible) for us today. Most important is a solution for the Kosovo problem. This firing of Primakov won't change the politics of Russia. Saying Yeltsin will still support a solution in Kosovo, still make pressure of (inaudible) to Belgrade and to Washington (inaudible), and I think this is what the urgent solution what we wait for. 

Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. Pleasure to have you here. We'll be right back.
