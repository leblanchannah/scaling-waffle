"How the Hell Did This Happen?" That's the title of the newest book by political satirist and author P.J. O'Rourke. The subtitle of that book -- "The Election of 2016." It is a no-holds-barred look at the presidential campaign, an across-the-aisle examination and critique of the candidates, the press, political punditry and even an analysis of how he, a diehard Republican, ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton. P.J. O'Rourke joins us from New Hampshire. I'm pleased to welcome him to this program. P.J., thank you for being here. 

You are very welcome. Thank you for having me. 

Thank you for being there, I should say. Let me start with this. You say, if my book lacks a coherent narrative, it's because I couldn't find one. Have you found one yet? 

Yeah, I looked everywhere. I looked behind the couch. I looked in all the places where I usually leave my cell phone. No, the coherent narrative wasn't there. Well, that is not really true. We're in the midst of a world-wide sort of populist rebellion would be maybe putting too strong a term on it, but there is a worldwide sort of -- well, let's call it a rebellion. Brexit is part of it. The neo-Maoism in China is part of it, Putin is part of it. As I point out in the book, even the politics of Australia -- now, the politics of Australia are so dull that the name of the conservative party is the liberal party. 

Yes. 

But they have had five Prime Ministers in six years. So all over the world there is some sort of discomfort with the elites, rebellion against the establishment going on, manifesting itself in various different ways, and here it manifested itself in a rather baffling man, who's now the president. 

A big part of this, rebellion is the populism and a lot of the book is very funny, but you take a more serious look at populism at the end of the book. What do you make of it? 

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. It really does. Populism can end up being sort of William Jennings Bryan incompetent and kind of funny and comic, or it can end up the way it did so many places between World War I and World War II, it can wind up really, really ugly. I'm hoping we're having, you know, history occurs first as tragedy and then again as comedy. I hope that is what's going on at the moment, but I'm not laughing really hard. 

What do you make of the president at the moment right now, this speech to a joint session of congress got so much attention earlier this week? People said he appeared more presidential. Did you sense a shift or do you sense a shift? 

Well, you know, he is a good actor. I mean, one thing -- again, I talk about it in the book, no journalist ever watched "The Apprentice." And that's not because we're smart, it's not because we're sophisticated, it's not because this is below us, it's because we're in the media, and none of us need to hear "you're fired" ever again. I mean, we all know what the state of the media is like. So we hadn't watched him on "The Apprentice." If you watch him on "The Apprentice," you realize Alec Baldwin has got nothing on the Donald Trump that Donald Trump does, he is a good actor. So whatever you call that, the address to joint -- state of the union except you don't know what the state of the union is because you've only been there a week, address. He was acting like a president. You know, doing a pretty good job of it. What that means, if anything, I don't know. 

You started to put together this book, or, you put together this book, it's more just a collection of what you observed during the campaign and, obviously, that changed very quickly from week to week and from day to day. In the end, you did endorse, as we said -- by the way, off the top, we said that you're a die-hard Republican, I'd say the better term is libertarian and has been for a long time. 

Yes, I'm a libertarian but it's been a long time since I voted for anybody but a Republican. 

But you did endorse Hillary Clinton this time and went through a long discussion of how little you think of her yet you still ended up endorsing her. And by the way, that's been the case for a long, long time as well. Do you have regrets about that? 

No, no I don't. I did it for -- you know, one of the things about libertarianism, is your political attitude is supposed to be based on reason. There is something in the financial market you probably know about called the volatility index, the VIX. You can actually go into the commodities market and buy a prediction on how volatile markets will be. It's called the fear index, and my fear index was, and I think rationally, quite high with Trump. I just felt the man was opaque to me, I didn't know what he was going to do. I disagree with Hillary about practically everything. I think I said in my endorsement, Dorothy and Toto's house fell on her, and I still endorse her, the munchkins endorse her. I knew what I was getting with her. We had eight years of Barack Obama, a kindred, more likable kindred spirit with Hillary. We survived those eight years. We would survive another four. I think four would probably be all it would be, because Americans tend to shift parties after eight, or at the max, 12 years. So I figured we lived through eight years of Obama without terrible damage, and we could live through four of hers. Whereas with Trump, might be ok, who knew, you know. I was talking to a friend of mine in the commodities business about the VIX, about the volatility index, I said, you've got all these Greek letters and formulas and stuff about measuring volatility and measuring risk. He said, P.J., let me tell you a secret, if you could measure risk, it wouldn't be risk. 

That is very true. America does volatility, I think, very well though, no matter where you come down. I wonder -- you flay pretty much every candidate who was running for office in this last election cycle, maybe other than Rand Paul, who didn't last for too, too long -- I wonder if -- 

No he didn't, I did like Rand, yeah. 

I wonder if you were impressed by anyone other than Rand, or more importantly I think, if you're future casting here, whether you see anyone in the future who you can get behind? 

Yes, actually, there were a couple of people that I thought were fine. I went to see Jeb Bush at a town hall meeting, really intimate, little town Peterborough, New Hampshire, close to where I live. Only a couple hundred people were there. He was excellent. He was truly excellent and completely believable. I went to another one in the same town with Kasich. I thought he was very solid. I don't see those guys coming back for another try. Marco Rubio, aside from not looking old enough to drive, I mean, I saw him actually where I'm sitting at the moment at St. Ansilum's College in Manchester, New Hampshire, again, fairly small crowd, he was very good. He had a kind of contentious crowd, and he was very reasonable, patient, brief and yet substantive in the way that he answered questions. I think he just needs a little more time in the -- a little more aging time in the old oaken barrel. He was good -- I heard him today on "Is Jeff Sessions a secret agent of SMERSH" question, or whatever it was. And Rubio had a good, measured reply about that, about how we want the truth, and we don't want a partisan truth, we want the truth-truth. 

You also say in the book, P.J., you talk about how it may very well be a long time -- even though we've sort of dealt with these controversies that have come up every single day, it's been an active time for the punditry and everyone else over this past six weeks. I wonder -- but you also say it's going to take a little while for all this to play out. How long do you think and when might we be able to assess all that's happened in the last two years? 

When a new president comes into office, things are always some degree of a mess. Then there is sort of extra partisanship that comes through. Usually it's in the form of a honeymoon. Stories from the first month or so of Obama's, I seem to recall repeated reports of his walking on water and so on. But actually even George W. Bush was -- I can remember somebody saying something positive about Dan Quayle right at the very beginning of George H.W. Bush's. So, you know, this is a little unusually negative, but the truth is, the beginning of all administrations are a mess. I mean, we certainly have to give it 100 days. And this is a particularly incoherent -- I mean, one of the things that bother me about having Donald Trump as president is that it seems to be absolutely intellectually incoherent and ideologically incoherent. People are all bothered about Steve Bannon as the ideological force behind the Trump administration. Well, there is no such thing as an ideological force behind an administration that has absolutely no ideology. So, you know, maybe after 100 days, we get a clearer idea of whether, like, the office and the institution suck him in and make him behave in a more or less normal fashion. 

But you don't think Bannon, for example, whether you agree with it or not, that he does have that -- that view that is a little more ideological. 

I'm not seeing a man -- you know, he's ideological, but I'm not seeing a man in Trump that listens a lot. I'm just -- you know, I just -- he has a pretty narcissistic personality. I have to say, I have trouble figuring out what -- it's like Trump is looking so closely in the mirror that when we look at Trump, we're looking at the back of the mirror. We're not really -- I don't feel like I have any sense of knowing this guy. I mean, you sort of know him because he's the guy that's on the last stool in the bar between you and the men's room and you're kind of like inclined to hold it because you don't want to have to go past that guy, the guy that's like sometimes funny, always loud, sometimes has a point, sometimes is really off the reservation, but is always going on. This is interesting because Trump does not drink, so how he got the position as the guy at the end of the bar, I'm not positive. But he's a pretty opaque character. 

You make a pretty striking comment about that. I think it's the last line of the book, which I don't want to spoil for anyone, but it's worth checking out. I want to return to this notion of elitism which has been discussed so much and populism. You also say in the book, you say, individual freedom is about bringing things together, politics is about dividing things up. This is not a new concept. 

Yes, I mean, that's what makes -- 

Yes, but it seems pretty important right now. 

Yes, that's my fundamental -- the reason I am basically a libertarian, I am a conservative, but my ideology is libertarian because I worry about big government. And I think we have a perfect example here for everybody across the spectrum. I worry, you know -- I watch liberals build a bigger and bigger government, and now I'm watching them when somebody else has gotten behind the wheel of this monster truck government, turned it around and run them down with it, you know, and they're all shocked and weepy. And I'm going, like, make it a kiddie car, you know, shrink the size of the monster truck. Then at worst, it smacks you in the shins. So, yeah, I think private individuals are a creative force and what politics basically does is take the fruits of our creation and redistribute them. And I don't mean that as an attack on the welfare system. I mean, military spending is a form of redistribution, too. Even infrastructure, which we're in no doubt in need of in this country, that is a form of redistributing the fruits of individual enterprise. And, you know, we don't want none of that, but we have to be careful about the size of the device we create to do that job. 

Well, you mentioned the big dig a couple times in the book in Boston which obviously is a project which ended up costing a lot more, I spent a lot of time in Boston, and took a lot longer than people expected, but you would agree that some infrastructure reconstruction is needed. 

Yes, it is. Although in the case of Boston, I remember when they built the expressway that the big dig replaced, and I was about college-aged and going out and visiting friends who were obviously smarter than I was because they were going to a college in Boston and not Ohio. So, I remember when that thing went up, and it should have never been built in the first place. You know, infrastructure is not like just a simple good. It's what you build and where you build it and how well you budget maintenance of the thing, is, you know, really needs to be carefully analyzed. 

P.J., I want to ask you about, what do you make of the media versus Trump, whether it's real or not or manufactured to any extent or is it theater, is it -- I mean, why, in your estimation is the president sort of taking the approach he is and what do you think the appropriate response should be from the media's side? 

Well, there is, you know, always in the media's relationship with the whole world, always an adversarial side. I mean, nobody wants to go to a play with no drama in it or see a movie with no tension in it. I mean, it's part of our job to stir the pot, you know. It's like I always say about plays and movies, is that I won't go see a play without a sword fight or a movie without a car chase. So part of media opposition to Trump is simply the natural order of things. You can get real serious about it and say we're speaking truth to power. I think that's getting a little -- we're getting a little above ourselves when we do that because that's easy. I mean, Xi Jinping, you stink -- it's easy for me to speak truth to power as long as I'm far enough away from the power. But then there is also an aspect that has happened in the media that makes Trump I think harder for media people to understand than maybe he would have been a century ago, which is, once upon a time, being like a newspaper reporter or even as relatively recently as me starting out, still a blue-collar trade. I mean, if you grew up like I did, kind of shanty Irish, you know, and if you didn't want to get up early in the morning or lift heavy things, you could essentially be a newspaper reporter or a priest. (LAUGHTER) I mean, you could be a cop, but then you would get shot at, or a fireman and that's dangerous, you know. But if you like to read, you didn't like to lift heavy things, so -- and then, you know, over the years -- I blame Nixon for this. Nixon was at fault for a lot of things, but you know, when Watergate came along and all the president's men, a whole bunch of people who should have joined the peace corps became newspaper reporters instead in order to save the world. I don't think we've ever recovered from that problem. 

P.J., you have a couple of teens, a couple of young kids, at least. You mentioned them a couple of times in the book. 

Yes. 

From their perspective, I know you paid attention to that, what do you think that generation makes of what has happened here? 

Well, it's interesting. My 19-year-old is at college, and I'm sure this has something to do with being 19. I mean, what she is most interested in is women's rights issues, specifically abortion. I mean, she sees that as fundamental. And I think that that's been a terrible mistake from the conservative side for quite a while. I mean, I am personally opposed to abortion, morally opposed to abortion, but I think it's a very, very private choice. 

On that note, P.J. O'Rourke, the book is called How The Hell Did This Happen: The Election of 2016. Very good to see you, sir. 

You're very welcome.
