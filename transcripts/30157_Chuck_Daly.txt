Stay with us. Former NBA head coach, Chuck Daly came to fame as the leader of the champion bad boy Detroit Pistons teams of 1989 and 1990. He was only the third coach in NBA history to win back-to-back championships, and he went on to coach the original Dream Team to an Olympic gold medal in 1992. After a 2-year stint with the New Jersey Nets, Daly now serves as a basketball analyst for Turner Sports. Joining me now for a look at the basketball season, Chuck Daly. Welcome back. 

Sir. Thank you, Charlie. 

Great to see you. 

Nice to be here. 

First, the NCAA before we go to the pros. What do you like? How do you size up this year's Final Four because you used to be an assistant coach at Duke University, the proud school that you and I love so much. 

Yeah. This has been kind of an interesting year. I think the fact that the three number one siege came out was kind of different. We had upset some of the early rounds and then it kind of changed dramatically and the favorites got there, but I think the big key is the parody. There was so many close games. There was so many overtimes. 

In one weekend like three overtimes. 

Three overtimes out of the four games. It just was endless. You see really spirited play. They've taken away all the super stars. They've gone on to the NBA early. 

Who will win though? Do you think that this is Carolina's year or is this the year for Kentucky or is this the year for Utah or is this the year for Arizona? 

I think it's very hard to pick a winner. Minnesota, Arizona -- Kentucky keeps surprising. Pitino has done a good job of playing the whole thing down with great talent. He's a great coach and their style is great. I think we could see overtime games. I think there's no way to pick a winner. Minnesota has shown me a lot, though. 

I said Utah. I meant Minnesota. 

Yeah. I would pick Minnesota. 

You would? 

Yeah, surprisingly. I'm usually wrong, but -- 

Kansas should be there. The best team in the country. 

Yeah. Kansas should have been there. I mean Roy Williams -- But that happens. That happens. So many people knock on the door before they get there. They always said certain coaches can't win the big games, et cetera. 

Mike Krzyzewski says and others say he's got the best recruiting season he's ever had. He's got four of the best players, so next year he's back. 

I would think so but expectations will be very high. When you're playing sophomores, it's a whole different deal. 

When you're playing in Atlantic Coast Conferences, it's a whole -- Big deal. 

Yeah. A lot can happen. 

Speaking of also tournaments coming up and championships coming up, this Sports Illustrated. Are the Bulls so good, they're bad for the NBA? How good are the bulls and are they certain to repeat in 1997? As close as you can get to certainty. 

I would say certainly they're odds on but when you go back and analyze last year, New York played them probably as tough as anyone else because New York is very physical. I think if you're going to have any chance to beat them, you've got to get close to them, you've got to be physical with them, and you can't let them dominate you in that area. New York has got to go through. They're going to have to go through a tougher series of games in the east than any western team, contrary to what Charles Barkley says. If you've got to play a New York, a Miami, and now Charlotte, and teams of this Caliber, Atlanta, who are going to be very physical, they're going to have to pay a huge price to get there. I fought in the finals last year. If Rodman does not have great games in 2 and 6 that they might get upset by Seattle. I think they're the odds on favor. I think they'll probably win it but I think this time they're going to be tested. They only need one volatile act by Rodman or one injury. 

Yeah. Grant Hill at your old Pistons has turned out to be one extraordinary pro player. 

I went to an early game before I started our season on TV. I thought, "Well, Grant Hill. I love him. He's a great player." I saw him. He had great -- A month later, I said, "Wow. What's happened?" He has become such a dominant layer, not only as a basketball player but now he has the fire like Jordan who says, "I'm not going to let my team lose. I will take over the game and win it." He has moved to another echelon and has become maybe second only to Jordan. 

He is the greatest player in the NBA to date. 

Well you've got so many great ones, but -- 

But he's moving up there because of all the things you just said. 

Yeah, exactly. 

Tell me who else. Who's having, in your judgment, a great season? 

Well I think you have to pinpoint Karl Malone. We all know about Karl Malone and he's always been around the MVP area but this year, I mean he is spectacular. They're going to probably end up with the best record in the west. That means they've got to hold core all the way through. That could prove to be the hurdle they need to get over. They've always been in the 4 5 spot, but Karl Malone is just having a most spectacular, spectacular year. 

Riley has done a hell of a job at Miami. 

Well Pat Riley is Pat Riley. I mean, you want to pinpoint one guy -- You talk about all the coaches, and there's some great ones. Lenny Wilkins and the records, but Pat Riley. Wherever he goes -- Well he's smart enough to get a great center. You know, he had -- 

Now why is that so smart? It seems obvious to me. 

Well, but he has a way -- First of all, but he had the one -- 

He had one when he came here. No, he went back. He had Kareem first and then he had Patrick and then he -- 

He kind of fell to that job from a broadcast booth, but he knew what to do with them. You know, all the glitz and all is only surface with him. 

He's the hardest worker in coachdom. 

Tough competitor, hard worker, and demanding. The guys buy in. He can get people to buy in. He's one of the great salesmen in the history of the game. 

Yeah. He also, I guess, has that notion that what he does to bring a team together can only last for so many years. He said that himself. 

Yeah. 

At some point, Magic got tired of it. 

Well, at this day and age with the kind of players we're getting, they get tired of you quicker now. They just finish after two or three years. It used to be you could last four or five. When I was in Detroit and lasted nine years, I knew I should have gone the two years before that because they get tired of hearing you. They know every inflection, and you also get tired of them. 

Yeah. We've heard that before. 

Yeah. You hear the same things. Changing is difficult. 

What should be done if anything about Dennis Rodman? You knew him, you coached him, you understand him, I guess. Even though he seems to be somewhere else than he was when he played for you. 

I love him, Charlie. I tell you, when he was right out here in Fifth Avenue, he never looked better. What they say about He'll never look better than he did that day, I guarantee it. I love him and he told me two years ago what he was going to do. I sat in Gibsons in Chicago. We were having dinner. He happened to be there at the same time so we hooked up. He said, "You know, I'm defense player of the year. I'm leading rebounder. I'm making two million dollars." Which to the average person, is a lot of money. It is. It's under the average. He said, "I'm going to change. I'm going to reinvent myself." 

I'm going to change my act. 

Yeah. He changed his act and hit his -- It's volatile but it's work. He's making money. He's making movies. Bill Laimbeer had a great statement. He was a very bright guy. He was at a game and I was in a suite, and -- 

Bad Bill Laimbeer. 

Yeah, but he had a 12 year old, an 11 year old and he said, "When they start wrestling, they don't know when to stop and that's what worries you about Dennis. I hope he goes --" Wouldn't have to cross the line. Now he's going to go with Hulk Hogan and wrestle. It's incredible what he's been able to do. 

But it's all something two years ago he said, "I'm going to create this act that will sell like big time on Madison Avenue. I'll make tons of money." 

If I sit with him, he's the same kid that was in Detroit. Same kid. He hasn't changed but he goes at them. 

But he doesn't necessarily know where the end is and he may go over. 

Yeah. You go up to the line and everybody at some point goes up the line. You look over. They don't jump, they don't cross. He gets close because he's very volatile but he still is a great basketball player. I hope that he understands that that's what drives the engine: Basketball. But he's pretty much going beyond that, surprisingly. 

Speaking of the game of basketball, would you change it in any way? Would you put in a 20 second clock? What would you do? 

I'd absolutely change it. I have to do them on TV now and we have problems with a game. First of all, shots have gone from 90 to 77. The scoring is down. Some people think we're losing fans. I have been in two meetings and you know, I won't talk about what's best, but the league is talking very seriously about what can we do to improve the game? When we move the line in, we became a post up game. Everybody throws the ball in, catches the ball, waits for the double team, kick it out, look for the three point shot, or they run, pick, and roll. They don't run plays. 

It's so simple when you explain it. 

Yeah. The sameness of the game is now starting to bother a lot of people. I think the league is seriously looking at changes. They're meeting with all of the top people. Coaches, general managers. I think they will come up with some ideas. 

Like that 20 second clock? 

I think a clock is one they'll consider. I think the line is one they'll consider. I think the lane -- There's any number of things but when you -- 

What, narrow the lane? 

No. Go to the trapezoid lane. But when you go to all of these things, there is no guarantee that will change the game. I think what has happened, we have this game on this floor that was made for 5 foot 8 guys like you and I or whatever we are. 

I'm 6'4" Daly, come on. 

I'm 6'2" but I mean, it was made for 5'8" guys. All of a sudden we've got all these guys with a wingspan. They're 6 foot 9 guards and they take up too much space. 

Speaking of little guys -- Speaking of actually the young guys in the league, who's the Rookie of the Year? 

I think Rahim or Iverson. I think probably Iverson will get it. 

Do you think so? 

Yeah. Kittles is making a move right. 

Yeah. He's doing well with that. 

Iverson has only hurt himself because of kind of an attitude situation. 

What it is about you? You understand the personality of guys. In the end, they got to you over the nets with some of them over there, but you seem to have the capacity to speak to these talented young men who have had too much, too soon. 

First of all, I don't look at them as having made a lot of money. I really don't care what color they are or where they come from. I've got to deal with them on a one-to-one basis with my team. Your general manager gives you twelve players, and you've got to make this thing work. You've got to take these twelves guys because otherwise, you're going to lose your job. They're going to fire you or you're going to get embarrassed. Somehow you've got to reach each one and every one of them are truly different. 

Are you going to go back to coaching? Yes or no? 

I can't -- This isn't a courtroom. I can't answer that. You know, I made a pact with Ditka and Verbeel. They fell off the wagon. 

You said -- 

So sort of -- 

Ditka is going to New Orleans. Verbeel is in St. Louis. 

Right. 

You're going to Orlando. That's a deal. 

No. I'm a little weaker than I used to be. That's about the extent of what I'll say. 

Because you sat right here. I can roll the tape saying, "I've had it. I've done it. I don't want to do it anymore." All of that stuff you said. 

I get nervous about basketball. 

What do you miss? 

The game. 

The game? 

Yeah. It's not the money. I would do it on a monthly salary. I wouldn't take a long deal. That's not important. 

You wish you'd say to me, you wish you'd taken a nick job when they offered it to you because -- 

They would have fired me at 59 days length. 

You're outta here. 5 months with a 5 year contract. That's right. You just play golf every day. 

No, no, no. 

But you miss being there. 

I like the game. I don't miss all of the problems you have to deal with. 

Well, of course you don't. 

But I like the game. I like to see the teaching of the game, I watch the games. 

But do you miss the competition? The sense of every night going in there -- 

Some days I do. Some days I don't. 

It can get long when you're on the train or on the plane or whatever. 

Facing the Ls, if you could say tell me we're going to win every night -- 

Facing the what? 

The Ls. The losses. 

Oh, the losses. 

That's the thing. You wake up and you might face an L. That really kind of haunts you. 

Riley has the best coaching situation in America. 

More than likely. 

More than likely. 

Particularly salary. What a deal. What a sweet Hookstratten. 

Hookstratten got that for him? 

Yeah. 

Just Bryant Gumbel going over to CBS. Who's going to represent you? Hookstratten? I'd call him up. 

Well, Cooper has been kind of representing me for years, but you know. We'll see what happens. I'll probably -- 

I know I can't put you on the spot here. I mean I can, but you won't help me. Is it under negotiation now for Chuck Daly to return to the NBA? 

No. Absolutely not. 

For anybody? 

No, no. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. You know, I'm a rumor waiting to happen. 

Is it your call whether you come back or not? 

I would say yes. 

Okay. So if you give them the -- Is Pitino likely to go to the Celtics? 

If they've got the right picks but I'm not sure that -- He can't wait and pick a team that can win it right now. He can do that and name is price. 

He can do that? 

Yeah, I think he can. 

Who do you wait for though? 

I mean, I think there are a lot of teams that are capable of winning and are close to it that he could name his price and name his team. 

Just give me an example. 

I mean Bill Harris is doing very well but who knows what might happen. You talk about the Orlando situation, you talk about -- Vesse had a right to be like 29 jobs open. I shouldn't say, but he's one of those guys who has got a job. He's got a terrific job with Shaquille. But those kind of situations, I'm talking about a year, two years down the row. 

He can wait for somebody to give him instant access to the championship? 

Absolutely. You start talking about coaches, you start to throw down him and Riley. Here's a guy not only done a collegiate level, but he was a great pro coach. He's a brilliant coach and he should be doing movies, anyway. He looks like a damn movie star you should have on here. 

All right. Chuck Daly, it's great to see you. 

You too. 

You're predicting Minnesota in the NCAA? You're predicting the Bulls to go all the way? 

Mr. Jordan. 

Mr. Jordan will do it. 

Yeah. 

All right. 

Don't hold me to it. 

We have the videotape. Thank you for joining us.
