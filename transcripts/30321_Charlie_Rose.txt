Thank you. 

Joe Pytka. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Of all the muses of George Balanchine, perhaps none have a story as fascinating as Allegra Kent. She danced for the New York City ballet for more than 30 years, she left an impression on the world of dance, she is known for performances and ballets like Ensemble and Bugaku. Once a Dancer is her autobiography, and I am pleased to have her here at table. Welcome to the program. 

Thank you. 

This book, Once a Dancer, has gotten, those that I have read, terrific reviews. For your candor, for your sense of the extraordinary life that you have lived. Was it difficult to write, to be as open and honest as you are? 

I've really -- Writing it, just to tell the story for so long that I wasn't ever quite sure it would be published. In that sense it wasn't difficult. Then, when I saw that it was going to be published, I got a little nervous. I was writing it to write it, and also for no particular audience. 

Tell me about George Balanchine, and the relationship between him and you. 

He was clearly interested in my talent, and of course he used to marry the women he was interested in . Their talent. He was married at that time. It's a complicated story, of course. He was choreographing things for me, but it didn't always follow that he was involved with the women that he was bringing up in the company and grooming for ballerina parts. He did a really interesting work for me after I became a principal, called The Seven Deadly Sins. 

Yeah. 

Lottie Langley did the singing, and I did the dancing. I did the sinning. 

The sinning? 

Yes. It's quite easy to do. 

When you look at the things - The major works that you did for him - Is there a theme for you? People talk about this, passivity. 

I don't feel I was that passive. 

They do talk about that. 

They do talk about it, but I think the very first role he did for me, I was held by four men. 

Your feet never touched the floor? 

Never, and I was just -- I was just not accessible. 

Yeah. 

Somewhat -- A fifth man was trying to reach me, and I was elusive. 

Why was he such a master? 

He was a genius, but he was also -- He could have been a composer, and he really knew music, and he understood music, but he also understood what was in front of his eyes. He understood what you could do in dance before you even knew it yourself. He would understand the sort of strange part of your life, almost. He's very intuitive. 

He was what they say about him and you. Number 1, that you would take time off to have babies. 

He didn't like that, no. 

Others didn't like -- He didn't like that. 

He didn't want his ballerinas to get married, but I did get married. 

Right, Bert Stern. 

I did, very young. Too young. 

Your mother wanted you to marry Bert Stern. 

She did. She directed me to marry him. 

She directed you? 

It wasn't a good idea. I was too young. I had never dated. 

It was your first date. Really? 

Yes. We had a strange life. In my childhood, we would go across country with hired men, who drive us, because though my father had lost all his money in an oil well, and mother was improvising. So we cross the country, and she knew there were two places where you could really live cheaply, in the South. Miami Beach, and Los Angeles. 

You would disobey the desires of George Balanchine. 

I wanted -- 

He didn't want you to get pregnant. He didn't want you to do -- 

I had 3 children. 

He didn't want you to work hard, and you worked. 

I worked very, very hard. 

He wanted you more devoted to dance. 

Totally. 

He wanted you to be the star that -- 

Wanted that. Dancing takes everything. It takes all your hours, so I wanted that, but at other times, I wanted to have another baby and just be a mother, so I did it. He allowed me to do it. He let me come back into the company. 

Unlike others. 

Everybody had their own story, but he was very good to me. Very generous. 

Why do you think that was? 

I think he liked my dancing. 

Just that? You helped him -- 

He couldn't quite understand why I was having a third child, but he let me come back. 

What are your great regrets about that time with the New York City ballet? 

At that time, there are less regrets, but I actually - I developed a pattern of being there, and leaving, and being there, and leaving. I kind of actually followed that pattern. Once I had set it as a teenager, I kept following it. That later regrets Balanchine asked me to learn Liebeslieder Walzer, and I said, "No. It's too much. I have so much to dance already." I'm sorry I ever said 'no' to anything he asked me to do. 

You're sorry you said no to anything he asked you to do? 

In relationship to the dance, yes. 

Was he in love with you? 

I think so. 

You do? 

He was married, and my mother actually wanted me to get married, too. That would put me in a different realm, but maybe my mother felt no one else would marry me. I was 21. I think I might have gotten a few offers later. 

You would have. Bert Stern. 

Bert Stern -- We were not compatible at all. We just viewed life totally from two different -- 

How differently? 

Just totally different. I wanted to dance. 

It's in the book. 

It is in the book, yes. He was a photographer, he was doing really well. He loved his models, and he liked that world. 

Hated you, that he was that way. That obviously caused great pain for you. 

Yes, of course it did. Yes. I was a very literal person. I took certain rules very, very literally, but not Balanchine's. 

Yes, true. You took your mother's rules, and other rules, but not his. 

Yes, I know. 

He protected you though, and you stayed at the company until just before he died -- 

He did protect me. 

-- Even though you weren't dancing. 

He did protect me. 

He protected you. 

It was very generous of him, because many, many find that transition from a professional to "What next?" Very, very hard. It's very hard. It happened when I was 45, and I hadn't trained for anything else. I had abstract abilities, but I didn't know what they might be. He let me stay in the company even though sometimes I only danced once a year. That's not very much. 

The coming of Suzanne Ferrell. 

His interest shifted to her, but not totally. He was still interested in his other dancers, but -- Actually, there are times it really upset me. It upset most of the ballerinas, but at other times, I was just doing my work. When I felt I was dancing well, it feels good to do good work, so I also knew it, but I liked it when Mr. Balanchine came back and said something to me about when I'd danced. Those times became few and far between. I didn't get the feedback from him. 

Is it hard, hard, hard for a ballerina to know that it's time to move to - You can't dance anymore, in the same way you could -- 

I -- 

-- As it is for professional athletes, as it is for lots of other people who are talented in the performance arts? 

I think it is hard. Except some of those racing girls, those marathon runners. They keep surprising me. They win at age 44, and things like that. 

You continue -- 

The body changes. My muscles are almost 60 years old, but they feel like they're much younger to me. I don't feel like I have the flexibility that I had. 

What was the hardest story to tell here? 

Some of the stories when I was married to Bert, and the children, and also -- He lost everything, and I woke up one morning and I hadn't saved anything. I'd given him my each paycheck, and he'd bought everything through the business, and he'd lost everything. I woke up one morning, and I'd moved out, and I was head of the household, and I was going to have to support 3 kids, and ballerinas don't make that much money. I was frightened. I was upset. I wish I'd handled that differently. I was really upset. 

What did you do? 

At first I was ill. I had mononucleosis, so I started from a sitting position. People called me up and said, "Come back to work." Jerry Robins called me and said, "Let's work. Come back," and I said, "I'm practicing." So I did. Work. Work helped, and people's interest and support. 

What's the happiest moment in this book for you? 

I think every time my life changed from the bottom - I was on the bottom, a lot of times, but it got to the top again. In some way, not always in - Oh, I did dance again, when I was 50. I really hadn't performed for 6 years. I overcame stage-fright. I wasn't as frightened, and a little life right. I subdued that too.
