The humanitarian conflict in Syria took another disastrous turn this week. On Tuesday, the Assad regime mounted a chemical weapons attack on civilians that has left at least 86 dead, including dozens of children. Tensions escalated further last night after the Trump administration retaliated, firing a barrage of cruise missiles at a Syrian government air base. Joining me now are two physicians who have been on the front line delivering medical aid to the embattled nation. Dr. Rola Hallam is the CEO and founder of CanDo. She recently led an effort to rebuild a children's hospital in Aleppo. Dr. Annie Sparrow is a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine. She visits the region frequently to train Syrian health care workers. They both participated in this week's women in the world summit here in New York. I am very pleased to have them here at this time. Welcome and welcome. What I would like to do first is go to what you said to me that I did not know when you sat down, there has been another chemical weapon attack outside of Damascus that happened today. 

Today. 

And you know this from your workers. You know this from -- 

I know this from my sources directly there in the field. So the doctor who actually responded to this told me about it, about four hours ago, which was shortly after it happened. 

And what did he say? 

Well, the first thing you know when there is a chemical attack is that -- it's usually the smell. You can smell something. And today it was chlorine. That doesn't mean to say it's just chlorine and it's not mixed with sarin or something equally hideous, which is what we saw on Tuesday, of course, but that's the first thing that you often notice is the smell and then the patients start to writhe. 

This is an important fact. If in fact they're, so soon after retaliation against the use of chemical weapons, they're using chemical weapons. 

Yes, that's his response and that's what we've seen before. It's not the first time and it will not be the last time. There have actually been more than 200 attacks since 2013, chemical attacks. 

How many? 

More than 200. 

Yes, mostly chlorine or... 

Oh, a mixture. Mostly chlorine, but a low-grade level. 

So the intent is to kill civilians. 

This is a war on civilians. I mean, I really take objection with it being called a civil war. This is not half the population killing the other half. This is a regime that has been killing its civilians. And as a doctor -- 

As a terror tactic? 

As a deterrent tactic -- 

I said terror tactic. 

Well, absolutely, I mean, I think it's in order to quell this ongoing opposition and as a doctor and as you know, there has been a use of destruction of health care as a weapon of war. Physicians for Human Rights have documented that hospital after hospital, doctor and nurse have been killed specifically for their medical -- for their medical support and for providing that because they think it's a much more effective way of attacking a civilian population. 

Where do you put barrel bombs in this? 

Oh, my God. I mean, that's been one of the biggest, most deadly weapons that has been used against civilian populations mainly, obviously, in opposition-held areas. And this is what I was meaning, the airstrikes and the aerial targeting that has happened of civilians, has been mainly by use of conventional weapons, incendiary weapons, barrel bombs, notwithstanding, of course, the use of chemical weapons, but it's a small fraction compared to the other weaponry. 

What do you think is necessary for governments in the world to do? 

First of all, the biggest difference between using chemical weapons which we care about and the more conventional ways of killing people is that to die through a chemical gas is the most obscene way to die that there is, and I say that as someone, as a doctor who has witnessed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of children die. So whether it's being paralyzed where you can't breathe, with sarin, or whether you're inhaling chlorine which turns your lungs into hydrochloric acid as you inhale it, which means you have -- chlorine doesn't kill you as effectively but these are weapons that cause the most awful way to die, so parents watch their children dying in this worst way because children are the most vulnerable. Parents lose their entire families at once, and I can understand that Trump doesn't like seeing dead babies any more than we do and any more than all of our colleagues and friends and relatives in Syria do, who have to watch their babies dying either, and a baby is a baby. It is not a terrorist. And these attacks are on Khan Shaykhun and all the other attacks last week, including the sarin attack last week in Hama a few miles away, are attacks on hospitals and civilian areas. It's very, very far from ISIS territory. They're not even close to the normal front lines on the ground, they're nowhere near ISIS. 

I'm asking two questions really. One, you support what President Trump did, you think this was a start? 

I do. I think that what needs to happen is the U.S. government needs to declare this not only as war crimes, but Assad and Putin as war criminals. Assad and all of his gang actually. And every important government around the world needs to do the same thing. Then, secondly, what needs to happen is that the U.N. Secretary General Gutierrez needs to quit stalling and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and gather the evidence of these war crimes for a future tribunal. That was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in December, and here we are in April and that needs to be done and that's where Ambassador Nikki Haley can also leverage that to the U.N. And then thirdly, we need to look at the billions of dollars of humanitarian aid and medical supplies that are channeled through the U.N. directly to Damascus, where they are then being controlled by Assad's family and friends. And that is used to basically consolidate Assad's political position and strength. And is actually fueling and subsidizing the war. And we see this very unhealthy relationships being -- like the World Health Organization has a relationship directly with the Ministry of Defense. It actually buys all of the blood bags. 

The World Health Organization? 

It has a direct relationship with the Ministry of Defense where it buys blood bags for all of Assad's army. Now, that's a good example of the weaponization of blood. So on the one hand you have jets and helicopters dropping barrel bombs and missiles destroying hospitals and creating this blood bath we've seen. And we have no blood going where it's needed, it's going directly to the Assad army. That's what we mean also where the targeting of hospitals is a very clear use of what we call the weaponization of health care. So they are using people's needs for health as a weapon against them. 

Are you disappointed in the Obama administration's action vis-a-vis Syria? 

Very much so, very much. What Trump did last night is something that -- what Obama should have done in August 2013 where we saw 1100 civilians killed. What he did last night needs to be done again and again because what he has said, what Obama said is that this is intolerable, and what Trump has said is this is not just intolerable but we will not tolerate it, and that's a very strong position. 

And no one else is prepared to lead so we are is what he said. 

I think that's the first step forward, but it needs to show that we will not tolerate the Assad government that is continuing to do this as we've seen with today's further use of the chemical. 

I think there are few cities in Syria that have suffered more than Aleppo. 

Yes. 

You had really factions right at each other there for a long time. 

Yes. 

You had a hospital there? 

So I have been involved in this area of humanitarian response since the beginning for the last six years and I have been involved in the building of six hospitals in northern Syria, in Idlib and Aleppo Governorate. And so what we saw back in November when the besiegement of eastern Aleppo happened and the attack there was, in one weekend five hospitals were bombed, including a children's hospital by the independent -- 

And you assume intentionally? 

We don't assume. We know that the data that has been collected by Physicians for Human Rights, by Amnesty International, by Human Rights Watch, that this has been an intentional destruction of health care rather than collateral damage of war. So that children's hospital that was run by the Independent Doctors Association had actually been bombed a staggering six times beforehand. And really that was what galvanized this global movement to rebuild the children's hospital in Aleppo. It was our way of saying, if war criminals are going to commit these murders and governments are going to stand by and let them act with absolute impunity, we humanitarians and doctors will not be deterred from doing our life-saving work. We're going to galvanize global action and we will continue to rebuild. And that's what we did with the People's Convoy. 

Are chemical weapons used anywhere else in the world? 

They have been, of course, used in Iraq extensively, and we know how they were used in World War I, of course. That's why we have the convention. 

The Iraqis used chemical weapons against the Iranians, didn't they? 

Yes, they used it throughout the Gulf War, and they used mainly sulfur mustard. 

The Iranian war was before the Gulf War. 

I don't know, I can't say it with confidence, but they have used it and the problem with a lot of those gases is that they hang around for a very long time. 

Right. 

And we know that even though they have been used in other places, we also know more importantly is that, you know, in Syria, they have been importing the ingredients for chemical weapons for several decades. 

And how many of them did they eliminate because of the agreement that was put together in 2013? 

Well, we know from what they said at the time that the sites they cleared were not all the sites. And we -- 

We also heard reports they had more than 90 percent of the chemical weapons. 

And when you look at how long they have been stockpiling and importing them, not only from the Soviet Union back in the '80s under the hoppers, but with the help of Soviet, Czechoslovakia, western European firms, Germany, still exporting them to Syria, the ingredients for sarin. After 2006, Britain did it extensively between 2006, 2010, so they have enormous stockpiles. To say 90 percent means what, so we still have, you know -- 

The reason I'm asking that, as you know, one of the principal reasons that President Obama said that he did not retaliate after they crossed the red line was because they made the agreement to eliminate a significant part of the chemical weapons from Syria. And many observed and have said a significant part of those were taken out of the country. Obviously not all of them because they've used them most recently. 

We don't know if Russia wasn't bringing back the same sarin that they took away after 2013. but what we also do know is that with something like chlorine, which is a dual-use compound, it's the most important tool of medicine, we use it to disinfect our water, but it is also -- so you can import it legitimately, but you can make chlorine bombs very easily and very cheaply. So chlorine becomes a very effective and very cheap way of causing mass terrorization of a population, where in the end -- we think very clearly, actually, that Tuesday's massacre was indeed an overkill, they didn't intend to draw this much international attention because we've seen this operate on a strategy where we had these low-level attacks that killed just a few people here and there, and which the international media doesn't really care about, until you see something like Tuesday, which is almost certainly because they didn't get the mixture of sarin and chlorine quite right. And there was a great deal of sarin and as we've seen, they did do it in a very pre-determined way to cause maximum effect, and that's what we saw and that's why we got the attention. 

Thank you for coming and thank you for the humanitarian work that you do. 

My pleasure. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
