We begin tonight with the re-organization at the National Security Council. Steve Bannon, chief White House strategist, has been removed from his top post on the principal's committee. His appointment to the committee in January was criticized for potentially politicizing foreign policy decision making, the shakeup also restores the director of National Intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as permanent members of the NSC. Joining me now from Washington, Jennifer Jacobs of "Bloomberg News", she broke the story. I am pleased to have her on this program. Welcome. 

Thanks, Charlie. 

How did you get this story? 

Well, some sources within the administration tipped me off to it this morning and said, hey, heads up, we've got a really big deal going on here. Now the administration, other administration officials have downplayed it little bit. And said, this is less of a powerplay, it's more just of a reshaping of a panel to the way it should have been now that Mike Flynn is gone, of course he was a national security advisor, was fired or resigned in February. And now you've got H.R. McMaster in charge and he is reshaping this panel and moving the puzzle pieces around a little bit to shape it to the way he wants it to be. 

OK. So, I mean, is this something the president had to -- obviously the president had to OK this. Did he play a hand at all as far as you know? 

Well, I was told that from the very beginning that President Trump wasn't very comfortable with having his chief political strategist having such a high-powered position on this National Security Council Principals Committee, he wasn't comfortable with it, but not so uncomfortable with it that he, you know, ordered a change right away. So, yes, of course this was all run through President Trump, the order was actually done yesterday, fairly quietly, there was no press release. No word about it. It didn't come to light until my sources told me about it this morning. 

Can you make the case that it is a loss of power for Steve Bannon? 

It is. It definitely is. He no longer is part of this executive committee, this principals committee of the National Security Council. But, listen, Charlie, not a whole lot is going to change for Steve Bannon, he wasn't going to these meetings anyway. He had the authority to go but he had not chosen to go, and he is still part of the larger National Security Council. So he actually went to an NSC meeting today, it's that larger group of like 100 or more people that, you know, so it is not part of the top, you know, the cabinet members and the top officials, it's a larger council, so he actually went today. And so, you know, he is not being excluded. I was told by three administration officials that his authority in the White House has not changed, that his influence with the President Trump has not changed, and if you look at all of the members of the inner circle no one is closer to Trump and doing more with President Trump than Steve Bannon. I mean, he tags along with him in the limo to these different meetings, and he's on Marine One and Air Force One. He'll be there in Florida for the next couple of days for, you know, the first meeting with the president of China. So Steve Bannon still has an enormous amount of influence with the president and that did not diminish. 

What about H.R. McMaster who replaced Michael Flynn? 

Yes, so this change today to the National Security Council definitely empowers him. It gives him more authority. He is now in charge of the homeland security council, he wasn't before, you know, now he is in charge of setting the meetings, where before that was Tom Bossert, you know, the homeland security advisor. So this shifts more power to McMaster. This is a win for McMaster to have this council structured the way he wants it, there is no doubt about it. But, you know, I was told it was originally Reince Priebus's, the chief of staff's idea to have Steve Bannon come on to the principals committee. It was Reince's idea, okayed by the president and others and, you know, now that McMaster is in place, I think what I was told is that with Michael Flynn there they wanted someone there to be a minder, quote, unquote, a minder to watch over him. He needed a little bit of oversight. I was told Bannon's role was to make sure that Michael Flynn got the job done. And, you know, even as far back as inauguration date, Michael Flynn was considered a little bit flaky by some in the inner circle in Trump world. And, you know, it turned out he did need a little bit of oversight. He was fired or resigned as we were talking about. So Bannon's role was to give him oversight, now that Flynn is gone, McMaster is in place, I think that Bannon and the inner circle really trust McMaster to do the right thing. He doesn't need to have someone babysitting and making sure he get the job done. He's going to get it done and get it done right. They trust him to do that. 

And the president, and I assume Steve Bannon as well, admire military people. 

Oh, yes, very much. And General McMaster has this reputation for being a truth teller. He talks to, you know, power to authority, he is not afraid to, you know, get back into the president's face and tell him if he thinks the president is doing something unwise. 

Well, he wrote a book about how everybody screwed up in Iraq. 

Yes, exactly, that's exactly right. And that's part of the reason why Trump brought him on and that's part of the reason why the inner circle likes him so much. 

So, where are we now in terms of this whole thing about Nunes coming, Devin Nunes coming to the White House and having these two staffers inside the White House show him stuff on their computer, or whatever they did, and then he goes outside and has a press conference and then goes back to tell the president what he just heard. 

Right. And that's all very strange. I know that has caused a lot of just head scratching and we're still a little bit puzzled as to, you know, how that all went down and where that's all going to wash out. We're waiting to hear, you know, more about that from, you know, Democrats and others who have had access to that material. I'm not fully up to speed on everything that's going on behind that, but I know that was just a really weird situation. As soon as Nunes hopped into that Uber and came and started doing this, you know, Inspector Gadget thing, as Lindsey Graham called it. It just raised a bunch of eyebrows. It was just very nontraditional. People started wondering if this was indeed the White House helping, you know, guide him to help bolster their case. It's just -- it's just a strange situation and I think we're just waiting for an update, you know, on what exactly, how that's going to wash out. 

Is the White House still not organized? 

Well probably not. I mean, no, it's not. I mean, even they would admit that they've got things that they would like to be a little more streamlined. They would like things to be a little bit smoother, but they're starting to get things together. They've got, you know, fallen into a pattern. Do they have things lined up for really important critical things and critical decision making on national security and other matters? No. But do they have certain things in hand? Yes. Like, for example, we heard about this big Westinghouse bankruptcy and how the White House really mobilized to try to figure out how to deal with this sale. Westinghouse, of course, is a company that builds nuclear reactors in the United States. And they have access to, they control, you know, secrets, nuclear secrets, technology, not only are they building nuclear reactors around the country, but they are also in charge of the maintenance for the current reactors. And as soon as they got the word, the White House got the word that Westinghouse on last Wednesday was declaring bankruptcy and that Chinese interests, a Chinese government backed company might be interested in purchasing it, the White House mobilized into action and they're trying to figure out what exactly, how to handle the sale, so this is just one example of, you know, the White House does seem to have certain things under control. I know they are looking for a new U.S. buyer for Westinghouse. They prepped the president just in case this comes up in the conversations with Chinese president Xi this week. So there're examples of where this White House is doing really well, but there are other parts where not so much, not hearing a whole lot about having a strategy in place for dealing with North Korea, you know. Not sure what's going to happen with Syria. I mean, there're just so many questions that have to do with national security and so many other matters where they are not organized. Another example, Terry Branstad is the nominee to be Trump's ambassador to China, and some dysfunction and disorganization in the State Department, he has not gotten through the senate nomination process yet, so he will not be there for this meeting with Chinese president Xi, which is, you know, the chance for these two, you know, world leaders to make their first impressions on each other. And who is Trump going to turn to for guidance and influence during this meeting? Well, not Terry Branstad, his new ambassador. But, you know, who will be there is Steve Bannon. (laughing) 

So the former governor of Iowa knew Xi when he came as a young man to Iowa, so there was a personal relationship there, which would be beneficial, I assume, at the kind of negotiations they're going to have. 

I would assume so. And Governor Branstad also has deep knowledge of trade, and so that's going to be something that is going to be important. And just, you know, just fostering that relationship, we've heard that one of President Trump's biggest goals for this meeting with Xi is that he really wants to just foster ties. He wants to have a rapport with Xi, and that's one of the most crucial things that can come out of this meeting. And Terry Branstad is somebody who knows Xi personally, who knows, you know, just how things work with the Xi delegation and really could work to steer Trump in the right way and foster those close ties. It is definitely an eyebrow raiser that he won't be there, but I know that Governor Branstad has chosen to stay away. He doesn't want to get in the way of the Senate process. He knows that he has not been confirmed yet, and he's not going to get in the way of that Senate process. 

What is it that the president believes that he has to come away with? 

I would say that their top goal is coming to some sort of resolution on North Korea. The vice president said it again today that if China won't help them deal with this North Korea situation, then the U.S. will take care of it. So I would say if there is one really serious deliverable that they would like to walk away from is that some sort of, you know, a strategy and a plan and a united front on dealing with North Korea. 

Jennifer, thank you for joining us. 

You're welcome. 

Jennifer Jacobs from "Bloomberg News." Back in a moment. We continue our coverage of President Trump's first 100 days in office. In an interview with "The New York Times" earlier today, the president suggested that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice may have criminally misused classified information. The president said that Rice had broken the law by seeking the identities of Trump associates in intelligence reports of foreign officials. The president also weighed in on yesterday's chemical attack in Syria and called Putin's continuing support of the Assad government a very sad day for Russia. Joining me now is Glenn Thrush. He is chief White House political correspondent for "The New York Times". He and his colleague, Maggie Haberman, sat down with the president in the Oval Office this morning. I am pleased to have him back on the program. Welcome. 

Great to be here, Charlie. 

Set the scene for me for this interview. 

Well, we were summoned to the Oval Office around 11:00 AM. It was a beautiful day here in Washington, D.C., and what was really interesting is, of course, the power map of the White House can really be seen by who occupies the Oval Office. I've done a number of Oval Office interviews and there tends to be one or two aides standing around the periphery, but this was like Grand Central Station at rush hour. 

Yes. 

There were four chairs set up, to my left was sitting the head of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, and to my colleague Maggie Haberman's right was Hope Hicks, and through the course of the interview, all of these various luminaries wandered in and out. Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, even Vice President Mike Pence, and a rotating cast of characters that I think probably added up to 12 or 15 people. It was just another illustration of the fact that proximity is power in the Trump White House, and people really want to be around him. 

Did the interview timing simply come out of the blue or had you been asking and they said, well, it will be some time on this day? 

Well, one of the things that Maggie and I wanted to do, particularly in the wake of the healthcare debacle, was to talk to him about infrastructure, which really seems to be, and is crystallizing I think in the White House and also in certain precincts on Capitol Hill, as being potentially his salvation in terms of gaining a win, moving into a more bipartisan phase of his presidency, and something that is much -- that is quite close to the heart of a lot of people who voted for him in the industrial Midwest. And, you know, to our surprise he took us up on that offer. But the funny thing, Charlie, is we went in with a list of questions about infrastructure and immediately, unprovoked, he hit us with the Susan Rice stuff, and we asked him -- he essentially claimed that it's going to be one of the biggest stories in the world. We hit him up immediately for evidence of this. He provided none. He then said there were other members of the Obama administration who had done similar things. We said, can you name those folks? He said, perhaps at a later date. So it's sort of the typical, the typical Trump technique in terms of diverting attention, and also attempting to make mainstream media outlets like "The New York Times" cover the Susan Rice story more vigorously. 

So what is it exactly that the president thinks that Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor for President Obama, did? 

Well, I think, basically, he thinks that, you know, her behavior is the smoking gun in his Tweet from a month ago, that she was one of the people who coordinated the, wiretapping against him. Essentially, what she's been accused of, and we should say this isn't just the president, Sean Spicer, the press secretary for the White House, said it, a bunch of other Republicans on the Hill allied with President Trump had said it, is the she unmasked members of the Trump campaign during the transition who were under surveillance. It should be said that Ambassador Rice has categorically denied this, and senior intelligence officials say it's extremely unlikely this was part of a series of systematic surveillance that was conducted by the Obama administration against the Trump campaign, but it is, obviously, I think from press reports, something that is worth pursuing. 

OK, so here's what my question about all that, because we had former deputy director and acting director of the CIA Michael Morell here talking about how unmasking takes place, and he said to me that certain people of a high rank can request when they see a conversation, a conversation with some foreign official that's being followed or wiretapped or whatever, they -- and the person who is the American is only identified as person 1, person 2, person 3, they can ask that they be unmasked. Now, and it goes through a procedure. To ask that something be unmasked simply because you don't know who it is is very different than going on with what the president has called a witch-hunt for people, is it not? 

Absolutely. And we should say, you know, again, that the president offered no evidence that Susan Rice or anybody else associated with the administration leaked any of this. There is no evidence of that. And Ambassador Rice and other senior administration officials have denied doing so. I guess time will tell as to who is right. But, look, Charlie, this is smart tactically. 

Right. 

As crazy as that might sound. They need to muddy the water in terms of the narrative on this, to change the conversation, which has really, really dominated this presidency for a month. You know, it's a self-inflicted wound that the president inflicted on himself. So from a short-term tactical perspective, why not try to blame the Obama administration? We'll see if it turns out to be true. We're hearing, as you said, that it's quite unlikely that it is. 

And suppose it turns out that in fact it is not true, can he claim that he had reason to believe it might be true? 

Yes, as he always does. Look, you know, I've had conversations with White House officials over the last couple of days. They've been increasingly candid about their concern about the information flow to the president. That is a dominant issue here. Now, part of that was actually solved, ironically, by the elimination of the masked man or the unmasked man, General Flynn at NCS. The current National Security Advisor, General McMaster has a much better reputation and much more professional approach to presenting data to the president. But, look, there are a lot of people who are waking in and out the Oval Office, and I was there today, you can literally see them walking in and out of the Oval Office presenting the president with papers and information. Trying to be a gatekeeper for this guy is an absolute nightmare. So he is getting all kinds of un-vetted information. So who knows where he is getting this. He wouldn't tell us. We asked him if he'd gotten new intelligence on this, he refused to talk about it. Again, all we got out of him was a vague promise in the future for him to disclose that there were other people involved and that there was new information that was going to come out. 

Is there anything new to add to the story of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee? 

Interestingly, he didn't talk about that. The one person he brought up completely unprompted was Bill O'Reilly from Fox News, who of course, it has been disclosed over the last couple of days, our paper did a story on it, has paid off something like $13 million in settlements to women who accused him of inappropriate behavior. And really almost unprompted he came to Mr. O'Reilly's defense, said he thought he hadn't done anything wrong, and he said that he wouldn't have paid out any of those settlements and that he would have gone to law. 

And he said he did that because he thought Bill O'Reilly was a good person and knew him, and he liked him, and all of that? 

Exactly, yes. I mean, the interesting thing, Charlie, you know, again, we came into this office loaded forebear to talk about the details of infrastructure, and when we did ask him specific questions about it, for instance, a really big, two really big questions are, what percentage of this trillion dollar infrastructure plan is going to be direct subsidies to localities versus tax credits, Democrats say if it's too many tax credits they're not going to go for it. We got no new information on that. He was not prepared to divulge details. And then another very significant thing is the Davis-Bacon Act, Republicans want it stripped from infrastructure. Davis-Bacon, essentially, mandates that people with contracts are allowed to unionize. Democrats again say that's a nonstarter. Again, he punted on that and said he would have a statement on that in two weeks. So, we went in wanting to talk about infrastructure, but it was very, very clear that the president wanted to talk about Susan Rice and O'Reilly. 

And with respect to Susan Rice, not only did he want to talk about it, but suggested that she might have broken the law and might be vulnerable to going to jail. 

Yes, and the other thing that's really interesting is the aides who were in the Oval Office very clearly didn't want him to talk about that. So at several points in time, a couple of fascinating things happened, Hope Hicks, who is very close to the president -- I don't think people fully understand the extent to which she is an important and respected advisor in the president's circle -- at some point during this interview attempted to steer the conversation back to infrastructure, not so much because we as reporters were pushing it, but because the president wanted to talk about it. And in one extraordinary moment when my colleague Maggie Haberman asked the president how much time he was spending on infrastructure, Gary Cohn, you know, the most powerful economic advisor in the president's midst said, hey, wait a second, Mr. President, you know, let's talk about trade and taxes, which we're spending a lot of time on. So it was a fascinating sort of real-life, real-time interaction with the president that exhibited so many of his strengths and, you know, some of his weakness in terms of staying on task. 

I was also struck by the fact that when he got to Syria, he also not only did he express outrage at what had taken place and how bad this was for the Russians to be engaged by this with Assad, he also took time to blame the Obama administration for what they had done after the red line was announced and then they decided not to go forward because they had made a deal to get all of the chemical weapons taken out of Syria. 

Right. And that was the dynamic that he really wanted to bring up. So those were the talking points that the administration has had. They put out a statement yesterday in the wake of these horrific images, I mean, some of the -- 

Right. 

I had to walk away from a screen today when I was looking at that. I have small kids. I don't want to see that, right? 

Right. 

And I think, you know, in the statement yesterday, the White House blamed the Obama administration, which is sort of stunning, so the president started to talk about that, and obviously we weren't going to interrupt him, it was the position he wanted to say, but we kept pressing him on the Russia question, and he said I think initially that he thought it was a dark day, a sad day for Russia, admitting that Russia and Assad are allied. And when we pressed him again, the most that he would say was that he was very disappointed in Vladimir Putin. And tellingly, he refused to say if this was one of those issues that he thought rose to the level of him making a personal phone call to Mr. Putin. 

Thank you for coming, Glenn. 

Take care, Charlie. 

We'll be right back, stay with us. Eric Ripert is here. He is a chef and co-owner of New York's Le Bernardin. The restaurant holds three Michelin stars and has maintained a four-star rating from "The New York Times" for more than two decades. Ripert's memoir, "32 Yolks", tells the story of his early life and his love affair with food, it is now in paperback. I am pleased to have my friend Eric Ripert back at this table. Welcome, great to have you. 

Thank you, Charlie. It is a pleasure. 

There are many things I want to talk about including the book and including this autobiographical part of this book. Also, tell me about temple cuisine. 

Ah, temple cuisine is something that I am very interested in. And I went to Korea because I think it's where they've mastered really well what temple cuisine is. And I will explain that to you very quickly. Temple cuisine is a vegan diet. 

Right. 

That is, of course, to feed the nuns and the monks. Every ingredient has virtues, medicinal virtues. And for the nuns and monks, who are cultivating the plants in the garden and also cooking, it's a mindful exercise, it's basically meditation, they also put thoughts of love and compassion into the food, and believe that those thoughts will have some benefits for yourself as a consumer. The food is meant to make you strong, healthy, and have a very clear mind. 

But not meant to have you crave it? 

You cannot crave because Buddhism is against attachments. You're not supposed to be attached to anything. So therefore the food is delicious but you never crave like you would crave potentially a chocolate cake or something like that. 

And why has it attracted so much attention, is it because there is clearly more, today, a sense of healthy eating? 

Yes, we want to eat healthy. First of all, it's very seasonal, so, therefore, you eat what it is. You eat what is in season at its best, at its peak. It's organic. And today we are very conscious of what we are eating. Nobody wants to have pesticides in their food. If you have a meat, you don't want antibiotics and growing hormones and so on. It's a movement and, therefore, there is a lot of interest about temple cuisine, although, like I mentioned it's a vegan diet, but it's a big movement in America and I think worldwide today toward vegetarianism and eating more vegetables on our diet -- 

And more plant-based food. 

Absolutely. 

What is it you think makes Le Bernadin the restaurant that it is and have won the plaudits of other chefs and diners as well as the people who write about food? 

Many components make the success of Le Bernadin and where we are today. The team is essential, and we have a very loyal team that stays at Le Bernadin for a long time. To keep a good team around yourself, you have to, of course, be respectful to them. They have to have good compensation and job security and an environment that is not hostile and where people come and are happy to work. I think we have created that. And then you have to be very passionate, work hard, and reinvent yourself all the time, not be afraid of evolving. And this is something that we really are not obsessed, but put a lot of focus on. It's to always evolve and reinvent ourself in terms of service, in terms of atmosphere in a dining room, of course with the food, with new techniques, new ingredients and so on. That makes, I think, Le Bernadin an interesting restaurant in the New York scene because we are not stuck in the past, we, again, are evolving. 

Yes. On the philosophy of living, you decided early on that one-third of your life would be for yourself, one-third will be for your family, and one-third -- have you kept that up? 

Yes. It's not like on a 24-hour day. 

Right. 

It doesn't work like that. But I'm someone who needs a lot of time for myself. And I do -- I read, I meditate, I practice Buddhism as you know in my house. I take breaks, I take vacation, I isolate myself at times during the year. I take retreats and so on. I make sure that I spend some good time with my family, quality time on the weekends and even during the week, vacations. And of course I dedicate a lot of energy and time in Le Bernardin. And I have a good balance. I believe that if you take time for yourself, it gives you the luxury to reflect and have a distance with the family and the business as well. If you do that, the family will support you, that will make you a stronger family member, and also a stronger boss. And then if you are good at work, of course the team will support you and it is a cycle like that. 

Where does the title come from, "32 Yolks? 

"32 Yolks." I am 17 years old in Paris at La Tour d'Argent, and my chef asked me to make Hollandaise sauce which is basically a sabayon, so you whisk the egg yolks and then you add clarified butter. And I think I am going to be able to do it, but I am 17, very skinny, not very strong, very slow, I can't beat 32 yolks into a foamy cloud. And therefore, it ends up being kind of pitiful scrambled eggs. And it will take me weeks to master the Hollandaise sauce and those 32 yolks. 

And how did you do it? Weeks? Later were you able to do it? 

Yes, I was able to do it. Well -- 

But why is that the title of the book? I mean, what does it say? 

Because it is a defining moment in my career. I thought I graduated from school, I was a good student, I am in this restaurant, I am going to excel. And on my first day, I realized that I am very weak compared to the cooks in those three-star Michelin restaurants. They have experience, I don't. So it is like a slap in the face or a wakeup call. And then I was so dedicated, so passionate. I wanted to really, really master the techniques and so on. So even on an afternoon, I would have a small break sometimes, I will go home and I would train -- 

Yes. 

-- to make sure that I am going to master it. And when I did master it, it was basically being also accepted by the team, saying, okay, the kid, he did it. 

Yes. Did the love of cooking come from your family? 

Yes. Love of cooking comes from my grandmothers, my mother mainly as well. Different styles. My mother was very influenced by the chefs of Nouvelle Cuisine and we had a very refined experience at home. My grandmothers were cooking foods from Provence, Italy. 

Yes. 

Soul foods from that region, and less fancy and it was more like no presentation, but the pasta was delicious. So I had those two experience, the very fancy one on beautiful China and very refined silverware and then flowers and candles at night on the table at my mother's house. And then something much more rustic with my grandmothers and the rest of my family. And it was well-known that I love food so much that it would make me happy. The entire family decided that to reward me, all the time they would feed me, basically. 

Also, this is autobiographical. 

Yes. 

And you talk about when your father was gone. 

Yes. 

And what happened? And your mother remarried and you had a stepfather. 

Yes. 

And you talked about being abused. 

Yes. Verbally and physically in a sense that I was beaten. 

Right. 

Yes. 

What impact did that have on you? 

Well, it is never good to be abused, obviously, but I think it developed in me a strength. I was at war with that stepfather that I had. And despite the fact that I was extremely young, I was very resilient. And I was fighting him mostly with my intellect although I was very young. He was not very smart. And I was winning battles. And it was almost -- and it became almost like a game. But I learned how to never give up in that painful moment. And I have been inspired to later on in life make sure that I would create a family that will not be broken and of course where tolerance is a must. And I apply that in every aspect of my life, at work, with family, and with friends. 

And how did you find Buddhism? 

Buddhism. When I came to America, it was an accident. I find a book at the airport that talked about Buddhism. And I was fascinated, I read it. When I landed in Washington, D.C., I asked my mother to send me some books from Dalai Lama, who was becoming famous because he just won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1989. And I started to read. And in the late '90s, beginning of 2000, I started to go to his teachings. I met him many times. And I have other teachers, including one that comes to my house, kindly, once a week to make sure that I am not getting lost with the philosophy, and -- 

But what was it about Buddhism that so compelled you to want to learn more and to become a Buddhist? 

Buddhism is interesting because it is a science or it can be -- the theory can be backed by science. It is also a philosophy and it is a religion, religion in a sense that it has rituals and so on. And I like the three aspects of it, although I love the fact that science can back the theory of Buddhism. And, therefore, it helps you to, in a secular way, bring the teaching and share the teaching with people without being dogmatic, without bringing the fact that it is a religion. 

So you come to Washington D.C. 

Yes. 

You get a job there. 

Yes, at the Watergate Hotel. 

At the Watergate Hotel. 

Yes. 

The famous Watergate Hotel. And that was your first job in America? 

Yes. 

And what brought you to New York? 

Well, I was 24 in Washington and Washington is a very quiet city for 24 years old. It is where serious business goes on and politics, as you know. 

Yes. 

And every weekend I was trying to escape the city and come to New York and party. And I was fascinated by New York, by the architecture, by the dynamic, by the energy, so many people with talent were in New York. I wanted to come here and basically find a place where I could express myself in my art, which is cooking. 

And then how did you find that place? 

I started with David Bouley, downtown. 

Right. 

Stayed about -- 

A famous chef. 

Very famous. He was one of the first American chefs in New York to become like a super celebrity. 

Right. 

Not for being on T.V., but for his talent, for the cook that he was -- the cooking that he was doing. 

And he still is. 

And he still is, of course. 

Yes. 

And then I moved in 1991 at Le Bernardin and never left. 

You do television programs now? 

Yes, sometimes. 

So Le Bernardin, you never had an interest or desire in terms of being able to, as so many people have, to own more than one restaurant, in terms of Le Bernardin name. 

Yes. Of course if you develop restaurants, you make more money, but I am not in my industry because I want to make -- of course I like money because it helps to have a good lifestyle and so on, we know that, it contributes to happiness in many ways, but it is not my main goal. And I started at one point to open restaurants in Washington and Philadelphia and we have one in Cayman Island. And then I realized my balance that we talked about was completely changed and I didn't have time to reflect. No time for the family and Le Bernardin that I love so much, which is the team. So therefore, I decided not to develop and stay focused on Le Bernardin and make sure that I lead the team every day and I inspire the team because when you start to have white hair, Charlie, you become a mentor, right? 

And I look at the book and this paperback, and one of the people endorsing it is your very good friend, Anthony Bourdain. 

Yes. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thank you so much, Charlie, pleasure. 

It is my pleasure. The book is now in paperback, Eric Ripert, it's called "32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line." We will be right back. Stay with us. Freida Pinto is here. Her acting debut took place in Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film "Slumdog Millionaire." It earned her much critical praise. She now stars in the upcoming Showtime miniseries "Guerrilla." The series follows a young couple who become political radicals in London during the 1970's. Here is a look at the trailer. (MUSIC) 

What was your last job? 

I taught English to immigrants. There was a misunderstanding. 

What kind of misunderstanding? 

I'd lobbied to make changes which were interpreted-- 

So you are a troublemaker? I don't think we have anything for you. (MUSIC) 

Don't give up. (MUSIC) (LAUGHTER) 

Hey! 

We were just on our way home -- 

You two are pissed up! Do you want to get yourself nipped? 

Just leave him alone. 

Hey! (YELLING) (MUSIC) (CRYING) (MUSIC) 

We need to do something. 

We can't devolve into violence. 

Whatever happens next, it starts with working for change. (MUSIC) 

This is all the police see. What we need is people who believe in what we believe. (MUSIC) 

To the people with the guns goes the power. You think you are free but you are not. 

We're up for something, if we're up for each other, now is when we have got to show it. I need your help. We are going to liberate a political prisoner. 

You're going to bust a convict out of prison. 

This is a really foolish idea. 

They are changing the laws on us. One day, people are going to ask us what we did. I'm not gonna tell them I sat on fence! (MUSIC) (GUNSHOT) (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) 

You cool? 

We're so (expletive) cool. (MUSIC) The government lies to you! It oppresses you! 

What we do has to be about ideals. We want the police to be held accountable. (MUSIC) 

Leaders, if that's what's required, then that's what we will be. 

You are here because you are black. We are the children of the colonies who built this empire on the backs of their labor. Strong in our pride. (MUSIC) 

They're soldiers and soldiers fight. (MUSIC) 

We are going to give them something to remember. 

Did you tell the police where to find us? 

Just trying to keep you from getting killed. 

This is the declaration of the state of war. (MUSIC) To the oppressed, know that you don't struggle alone. (MUSIC) Power to the people. (MUSIC) 

I am pleased to have Freida Pinto back at this table. Welcome. 

Thank you, thank you so much. 

This is a series. 

Yes, it is a miniseries, six episodes. 

And you play Jas. 

Jas Mitra. 

Yes. 

Jas Mitra, she's -- 

She is the evolution of a radical? 

She is one-half of the revolutionary couple, Jas and Marcus, who we follow through the entire series. And it is really about -- it's set in 1970's, the 1971 Immigration Act, which really impacts a lot of the decisions and the actions which has consequences. But it is really about this relationship under pressure. 

And Idris plays Kent. 

Idris plays Kent. He plays my ex-lover. 

Who comes back for -- 

To create some trouble. (LAUGHTER) 

To create trouble, yes. 

Yes. 

But it is about the evolution of political radicalism in the '70s, in London? 

In London, yes. And it is actually based on facts that even I was not aware of, something that I thought when I first read the pilot episode, I wanted to verify the authenticity of all of it. So I go on to Google and I typed the 1971 Immigration Act. And there is information but it is not as well documented as the Civil Rights Movement or the Black Panther Movement. 

We have actors coming to this table all the time who say the best work they see, the best script, the best text, the best characters is on television. 

Yes. I have to admit that is kind of true. This is my first ever T.V. show. It didn't feel like I was filming a T.V. show because it felt like too really intense, independent films that I shot back-to-back, especially working with someone like John Ridley. But the kind of -- 

Who wrote the screenplay. 

Who wrote this, yes, and directed three of the six episodes as well. But I kind of feel like with this particular one, I now understood why actors love television. You get this extra time to go deeper into your characters, which sometimes it can be rush, rush, rush in a film. 

She tells Kent in episode one, I have to be with someone who wants to do things, as to why she is no longer with him. 

Yes. I think she does not know how to be neutral or quiet in the face of injustice, and that, you know, as we go on the episodes we will find out that it really comes from her father as well. 

Who is in prison, was he not? 

A political prisoner in India. And she really is actually, you know, fighting for her right in England to be a part of, you know, I don't know how much you know about the Immigration Act but according to the 1971 Immigration Act, which by the way, is not yet repealed even today, people who came from the colonies, so mainly from the countries of Africa and Asia, were under the threat of being deported and sent back to their country, called non-patriols. And so she's really fighting for her right and her right to be in England and work. 

And so what is her relationship with her boyfriend Marcus? 

He definitely is someone like she says, you know, Marcus wants to do things, I want to be with someone who wants to do things. I definitely think he is the -- he is the more understanding, less volatile, compared to Jas. And they balance each other off in that sense, or balanced each other off in that sense really well. But now they're also at a point in their relationship -- which we see in almost every relationship and they don't have to be political for that, or radicalized for that -- there comes a time where you really question if you are really up for each other and they actually reached that point. So the start of the series, they are already in a difficult place in their relationship and then they do something that questions their faith in each other even more. 

And then Kent comes back too. 

And then Kent comes back to make it even more difficult, which, you know, you will find out in later episodes that she does not share that information with Marcus. 

Is she prepared for the life of a political radical? 

I don't think so. I think she, in her mind, she knows and she is determined to stand up for what she believes in. But as I was filming the series, I thought about it and I go, oh, there is so much of this that she did not even see coming her way, but she bravely went ahead and did what she wanted to because she believed in it. And much like, not just Jas, but even Marcus, and all of the group of people that come together to form this underground cell, they really are operating out of, really not knowing, playing each moment as it comes. And, you know, there are surprises along the way. And one of the things that John always said in any revolution, any movement, there are actions that people take because they believe in that point in time that is the right thing to do. And if you don't account for consequences, you are going to be majorly surprised, and I think that's what Jas and Marcus find themselves in. 

When Danny Boyle, we talked about this before, casts you in "Slumdog,". 

Yes. 

Had you done much television or films? 

I hadn't done anything. 

You were simply a model in India. 

I used to model and did this travel show. I hated modeling because it was just not something that interested me. So I did this travel show and I traveled all over southeast Asia for nine months, fascinating. 

A nice gig if you get it. 

It is a nice gig, right, and why not, like a paid holiday and get to learn about different cultures and there was an open casting call and that's what I went into. 

How many in the open casting call? 

I don't know the exact number but I believe they ran into thousands and it was not just in Bombay, the city that I grew up in, but Mumbai. I believe it was all over India, Deli, Calcutta, even England and America. 

So if you grew up in Bombay. 

Yes. 

And then became Mumbai. 

Yes. 

Do you still refer to it as Bombay or have you sort of become used to Mumbai? 

I kind of use Mumbai for people who get confused when I am talking about Bombay being the exact same city. And I was born in 1984, it was Mumbai in 1996. And I was so used to calling it Bombay. And for me, a lot of the city that I see is, in my head, still Bombay. So I have still have not made a complete association or rather the dissociation from Bombay and moved into Mumbai fully, I haven't done it. So, yes, when I talk to the press, I try to say Mumbai as much as I can because that is the right name. 

Is it India's most interesting city? 

I think the people from New Delhi would come charging after me if I said -- 

I think of that as a government seat rather than -- 

Yes, that would be, yes. I would say it is a fascinating city in terms of the extremes that you will see. You see that in almost every other part of India but in Bombay or Mumbai, there is no escaping it. As soon as you land into the city, you are bombarded by, your senses are just assaulted right away. And in that sense, it is really extreme. There is slow and fast happening at the exact same time and somehow you have to cope with it. 

My impression is I see more Indian, more actors who are born in India of Indian origin doing well. 

Yes. 

Prominent in terms of global cinema. 

Yes. I have to say every time I meet people I go, there is 1.2 billion people in India, if you are telling me that we are a country without talent, I take it as a big offense. So I am really happy. I think it is finally happening. And talent is getting drawn into like people coming to India to film a lot in India. I mean, the success of all of the films that have happened in the last couple of years and will continue to happen that used India as its backdrop, and as well as Indian actors and talent and musicians moving into the West, Hollywood, England, everywhere. I think it feels appropriate. 

And what did your friends and others say to you after the stunning success of "Slumdog Millionaire?" What did they say to you? 

Well -- 

Did they say to you, choose carefully? Did they say, you got to do something very different than what you just did? Did they say to you -- 

I don't think my friends were involved in that decision-making process, but I was. And I think one of the things that I realized, you know, I was not prepared, but I did realize something, is that what I have been given is great. I work for it but it's a gift. It comes once in a lifetime and when it comes in a lifetime, you've got to grab it with both hands and make the most of it. And the first number one thing that I said to my agents was even if it means not getting paid or working in smaller films, I don't want to be stereotyped. 

So what did you do? 

So I consciously steered away from every project that would be -- and it happens, it doesn't -- I don't know if it happens as much now because I definitely don't get scripts like that anymore. But you get these stereotypical Indian roles, you know, and mostly it was about the women trying to get married. And their whole life was centered around having the perfect arranged marriage. And that is not who I am. I am 32 years old, I'm not married, and my parents don't force me to marry. And I don't believe that all of India is in the way that that one person sees the stereotypical vision. So one of the things I did was stay away from that. So my second film -- and also the other thing I tried to stay away from was getting stereotyped as just the pretty girl in every film of the cardboard cutout. I did get caught in that bubble for a while as much as I tried my best. But my second film was the very politically charged film "Miral" with Julian Schnabel. 

Right. 

Which kind of got a lot of flack for whatever reason, you are talking about Israel and Palestine. 

Real life story, sort of. 

Exactly. Good luck to anyone who takes on that subject matter. 

Yes. 

But that is what I wanted to do. And I am glad, I am glad, you know, even if the film wasn't widely well received. I am glad I did not do a blockbuster right away and get lost in the -- 

Your charitable work is important to you? 

Very important to me. I get asked all the time how much time is the charitable work or I really actually don't even like calling it charitable work. I like calling it social responsibility. How much of my time is for social responsibility work and how much time is acting and I go, I say kind of like it seeps into each other, even if I don't try to, it is 50-50. I just did this pilot run for a project that I wanted to try out in Los Angeles for a food recovery program, simply because I live in that city, I have been there for five years, and I walk around that city and I see the homelessness and food being wasted. 

You see homeless and people who need food and you see food being wasted. 

And then you see mansions. 

Right. 

And just these big Hollywood parties, which I am saying by all means, I am not saying don't celebrate and don't go throw a big party to celebrate your film or films, but let's have a little bit of purpose at the end of this party like where is this food going, you know, that consciousness that we need to have. And so as I asked this question around, it seemed like it was going into a trash can. Some places did actually serve their food out to the homeless population but most often it was not connected anywhere. So I called upon a friend who works in San Francisco. Her name is Komal Ahmad, who runs this company called Copia, and she has been doing it for five years. I love the company name. It is like the horn of plenty, cornucopia. And she said okay, fine, let's draw up a pilot project and ran it around Oscar weekend. And we covered 1,366 pounds of excess food, edible food that would have been wasted, and served more than 1,100 people in Los Angeles. 

Good for you. 

We are hoping to roll it out into a fully fledged program to serve the studios and productions that happen in Los Angeles. 

What is the next film? 

What is the next film? I have a very -- an Indie film but one I am very excited about because my friend worked on it for 11 years, it is called "Love Sonia." It is Tabrez Noorani who was a line producer of "Slumdog" and has produced "Life of Pi" and many other films that shoot in India. And it's a story about the sex trafficking racket that starts in India, moves to Hong Kong, and then into Los Angeles. And again, based on true stories of actual girls who have been trafficked on that racket. So I am very excited about it. I play this really crazy prostitute who is mean to the new girl who arrives at the Brothel. And I'm actually, I have to say, after what, nine, eight years of being in this industry, I am finally being given more mature, more serious roles. And it took two and a half years of not working at all to go into like deep anxiety of like, is it over? 

You mean you turned down things? 

I turned down things and then, you know, people forget when you turn them down over and over again. And it took a lot of patience and getting over, and dealing with the anxiety of this industry to finally arrive at Guerrilla" and "Love Sonia. 

Great to have you back. 

Thank you so much. 

Good to see you. 

Thank you, thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
