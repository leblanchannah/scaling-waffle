campaign finance system. Voters are not connecting with the issue in spite of this winter's White House fundraising scandals that may change with hearings coming up in both the Senate and the House. President Clinton's appointment last week of two popular retired politicians, one from either party to work towards reform and the efforts of my guest. Joining me now from Boston, where they began a push for grassroots support for campaign financial reform today, Senator John McCain of Arizona. He's a chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Also Democratic Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and I am pleased to have both of them join me. Let me just begin my saying what is it you're doing to build grassroots support in Boston and what good do you think it will do? Senator Feingold? 

We started today an effort in Boston that will be a nationwide effort through Common Cause and many other organizations through Project Independence to pull together 1,776,000 as signatures in favor of the McCain-Feingold Bill. We urge people to call the 1-800 number, 1-800-454-2634 in order to be a part of the petition drive. We need this push. It is determined to get these signatures by July 4th, the time that the President is asked that he have a campaign finance reform bill on his desk. 

Senator McCain, I said to you before we start I can't imagine any subject that's been more written about when you include all of the fundraising scandals that are now in the plate in Washington. Then campaign reform, why is it not doable? So far? 

Well Charlie I think one of the problems is as you know is that the system basically, to a large degree ensures incumbency. In the last election, there was only one Senator, incumbent Senator who was defeated and about 95% of the House speakers were re-elected. We've got to convince our colleagues in the Senate and the House that this won't remove their ability to be re-elected. The second thing is as you know people get used to a certain way of doing business and then money flows very freely. It's tough but if there's enough outside pressure, we have prevailed. 

Is it your colleagues specifically we have to be talking about? I mean your Senate Republican colleagues rather than Senator Feingold's colleagues? 

I think of a lot of it is mine. Some of it is his. As you know Republicans are in the majority in both Houses. So some of the views of there's is that they maybe have the most to lose. Also as you know more soft money goes to Republicans. At the same time more labor money goes to Democrats. It's an uphill battle but it's all dependent as it was in 1974 on the amount of the scandal and the amount of the outside pressures. 

If Trent Lott said tomorrow I awaken to the idea that we've got to do something and I think McCain-Feingold have the right idea. Would it be a done deal? 

I think we would then enter some serious negotiations. By the way, just last week Trent Lott said that he thought we would have to move on this issue as many others are beginning to realize what you just said earlier. I think serious negotiations would then go on where the White House would have to be included. But also a lot of outside organizations pushed on this issue for a long period of time like Common Cause and others. 

A good way to look at this is what happened with the gift ban where for a long time there was no real support for the effort John McCain and Paul Wellstone and others had to try to ban members of Congress from getting gifts and everybody acted like the issue wasn't there. Once the wall started to crack, television shows about lobbyist and members of Congress going to tennis tournaments and so on happened, all of a sudden the wall cracked and it was like a flood and it ended quickly. I think the same thing can happen here once we reach the critical masses' support. If there's one thing I know about Trent Lott, he's smart and he's know when an issue really is becoming an albatross for those in elected office and I think he's willing to negotiate. I think John McCain's right, he's beginning to show the signs that he may not want this issue hounding away at the Senate for the entire two years of the 105th Congress. 

Where is the negotiability? What's on the table to be negotiated? 

Everything's on the table 

I understand that but where is it that push comes to shove? Where does the rubber meet the road on this issue? 

The two most egregious aspects of these latest finance abuse if not illegalities really are major are two. One is the dramatic increase in so called soft money. Russ says that my legislation would ban that basically, would make it hard money. The other of course is the dramatic increase in labor involvement in political campaigns. We think that those cures would have to be balanced so that either side would lose that particular advantage. That's two of the major issues. There's many others such as how much money a candidate should raise within his or her state and other issues like that. Its all go to do with voluntary spending limits. We can limit contributions constitutionally but we have to have something like free television time for the candidates in order to induce them to observe a spending limit. 

This involves a delicate balance where we have to achieve what I like to call moderate neutral disarmament between the parties. At the same time you can't, to continue the nuclear analogy, you can't expect one side to unilaterally in effect commit political suicide. The tricky part here will be to reassure members of Congress. Sure they're going to give up something as incumbents. It's going to be a much better situation for challenges but they're not completely eliminating their ability to get re-elected. It's going to be a one by one effort. 

So you say to me if I'm up for re-election and I'm a member of the Senate and I want to live by some new campaign reform rules that yes, you're not going to be able to have as soft money given to the party that would benefit you anymore. On the other hand you'll get free television time. 

That's the kind of thing I think there's a real interest by many members of the Senate who really despise the fundraising that they're willing to not have as much money. They're willing to take at least some chance that they might lose in return for being able to focus on the people back home and their jobs. I really want to say this about my colleagues. I think most of them really enjoy representing the people in their home states and most of them enjoy the real work of being a Senator. If they're given a reasonable chance to agree to a fair bill that it is very possible that they'll give up some of the advantages of incumbency to have that. It may sound na>>Ã¯ve but I know these folks and I think many of them would like a different way to do business. CHARLIE ROSE: Senator McCain, you're up next time and people are talking about you as a "guinea pig". With your run for re-election, you live by campaign reform rules as described in your bill and you'll show that it can work for an incumbent. 

Yes, except obviously there's the problem that I don't get free television time as you know. The other inducements such as lower bulk rates for mailing 

If you got that you'd be willing to be guinea pig, wouldn't you? 

Absolutely, without a doubt. By the way, even after we reform it, the incumbent will still advantages because the incumbency itself creates advantages. Yes, I think that I would not only live it I would be eager to try it. I think that if after some years of service to people of Arizona, if they don't know me well enough then I probably don't deserve re-election. 

Let's look at some of the scandals that are brewing there for a second. Senator McCain, is the attorney general going to call for independent counsel now. Do you think we've reached the point where she's about ready to change her mind and say there is sufficient evidence to move ahead? 

Charlie, I've been convinced that it was going to happen for a long time. In fact, you and I talked months ago on your show about it. It's inevitable, it was and is, what the attorney general in my view risks now is a loss of her well earned credibility and her very good reputation if she keeps dragging her feet on this. I think it's clear that circumstances dictated, particularly in light of the criteria she used before in the appointment of four other independent counsels. 

Senator Feingold you see some change in her position the way she's defined what would bring her to a critical mass? 

I think she's actively looking at this. I was one of the first members of the Senate and second Democrat to call for an independent counsel weeks ago. I think it's clear under the discretionary powers that the attorney general has that have to do with political conflict of interest. This has got to be a situation where you have an independent counsel, a special counsel appointed. I think the attorney general will come to that conclusion. My feeling is that this should include both Congress and the President. It's clear that they're allegations that have to do with both the Presidency and the Congress and a truly appropriate independent counsel call would include both. 

What happens then to Fred Thompson's committee investigation? 

It proceeds. There's no reason why Fred Thompson's committee wouldn't proceed. There may be some limitations that would be requested by an independent counsel and I see no reason why that investigation should not proceed. It includes both illegal and improper conduct now. If you just go with the independent counsel you can't really get into improprieties that aren't illegal because that's the role of an independent counsel. 

Also Charlie let me remind you that Watergate it worked. They had an independent counsel and they also had the hearings and they didn't conflict with one another. It was Iran Contra where I think some mistakes were made. 

Vice President Gore has been in China, speaker Gingrich has been in China. Do you accept now the idea that the Chinese clearly, illegally tried to influence policy and the electoral process in the United States? 

There's no doubt in my mind that the allegations are extremely serious that they attempted to do so. 

And evidence is extremely serious 

Extremely serious, but I still am not convinced that they succeeded. I don't see any evidence that they have succeeded but the allegations are serious. I dare note as you probably saw Charlie, the Guamanians are the highest contributors on a per capita basis than any other group of Americans. I was interested in their involvement in the policy towards them. 

Senator Feingold, where do you think we are with respect to this, what seems to be the most egregious, the use of foreign money to influence American politics? 

Well it is probably the most egregious thing that's been suggested. It's been suggested, not just with respect to the Presidential campaign but also specifically with regard to various Congressional campaigns. I don't know the answer to whether or not the Chinese really did it. They deny it vehemently. I don't know what the connection would be to the various Senators or Congressman involved, to the President. That's the whole reason why we need an independent counsel. That's why we need a very vigorous and properly funded congressional investigation because there's nothing more serious. An allegation that a foreign power, that is definitely a competitor of ours and certainly a rival in many ways, has possibly been invited through the way our system is set up to undercut our own foreign policy decisions. There's very little that can be more serious than the allegation, it has to be investigated thoroughly. 

Do your constituents care about this? 

Yes they do. The claim that people don't care about corruption in public office and the excessive use huge contributions is absurd on its face. People say, "well this poll shows that people don't identify this issue. Well, if you ask somebody what they care about, what they want government to work on. They're going to say, "get my kids a better education, make sure that I don't become a victim of crime." They assume that we'll do things like balance the budget and not have a rotten campaign system. It's not gonna be on their list as a general rule because they assume that of us and want us to attend to the issues that affect families on a day to day basis but they do care about it deeply. 

But help me understand this Senator McCain, both of you. I've thought about this. A notion is that you get the best government when you have-- You would think the best government would deliver you the best dealing with America's problem. I know I know Senator McCain, I'm choosing my words carefully because you don't think government ought to be dealing with the problems as much as people ought to be dealing with the problems and you and Mario Cuomo had that debate one night on this program. 

Was very vigorous. 

So I don't want to get in to that whole discussion. I do wonder why this doesn't register higher on the Richter scale in terms of grass roots demand that the system be changed. 

I did a little research recently Charlie because I've been puzzled by it also. It was not until well deep in to the Watergate scandal that the American people became aroused. It wasn't until the focus of the Urban Watergate hearings were intense and focused that the American people finally became involved. After a serious allegation after another had been raised during Watergate. The American people basically reacted as they are now and president Nixon's approval ratings remained high. I believe that the American people are concerned but as Russ just said, if you say which is more important, educating your kid or cleaning up this finance reform business? You got to relate it to the American people. 

But aren't those two things connected? 

I think they're very connected because first of all, special tax breaks and special appropriations and court barreling is directly related the influence of special interest in Washington, which is money. 

How much money is available for education in terms of positive creative programs is a result of how much money they have in the pot in general. 

You're exactly right and the special tax breaks for special interest. We have to do a better job at making that connection so that the American people will be convinced that it does affect their daily lives. 

Speaking of -- Senator Feingold. 

Let me add Charlie just to say that the key thing on this issue is how people feel and what the polls show and what everybody says at the key moment when we vote on this issue. Just like the only poll that counts is on election day. People are busy. People need several incomes just to make ends meet. They're not on an everyday basis going to be talking about this issue primarily. What counts is when there is a clear opportunity to vote on this issue. I think you're going to find an overwhelming response in the American people when we get to the actual vote. 

John McCain, republican in Arizona; Russell Feingold, democrat from Wisconsin. Our thanks for joining us this evening.
