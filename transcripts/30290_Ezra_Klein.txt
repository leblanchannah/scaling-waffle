We begin this evening with health care. House Republican leaders postponed a planned vote this afternoon on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. President Trump met with the House Conservative Coalition, known as the Freedom Caucus, earlier today, but was unable to secure the group's votes. The House Republican Conference is scheduled to meet this evening to discuss the plan ahead as we tape this program. A full House vote could come as early as tomorrow morning. Ezra Klein of Vox Media joins me now. I'm pleased to have him here. Help me understand why they are unable to put together a bill that will pass the House. 

They've got a fundamental problem which is that nobody really likes the underlying bill. I had a conversation last night with a Democratic senator that I thought captured this well. Donald Trump, President Trump has been going to Republicans last couple of days, last three or four days, and in private the case he is making to them over and over and over again is if you don't vote for this, you will you lose your seat, Republicans will do poorly in the midterms. And this senator, he made this point that when President Obama was selling the Affordable Care Act in 2009, he came to them and he said, if you vote for this, you may lose your seat and it will be worth it. And this is a real difference between what happened with the Democrats in '09 and the Republicans right now. The Republicans did not spend a lot of time working with each other to come up with a vision for health care reform that they liked. They were all on the same page about repealing Obamacare. They all wanted to do that. But they didn't really ever figure out what they wanted to do after that, what they wanted to do in terms of replacement. 

Let me interrupt you right there with one quick point. Did they fail to appreciate what the Affordable Care Act meant to their constituents in part? 

I think they did. And I think they have also cocooned themselves. Look, the Affordable Care Act is not by any means a perfect bill, it is not by any means a perfect structure. But if the only information you get on it is within right wing media, you would have the impression of a law that is in a state of failure and collapse and terror. This is just not accurate. And it's interesting. I did a piece recently where I went and I read every single thing President Trump has said about health care since opening up this bill, since this bill was unveiled. And it is interesting because he has a vision of the Affordable Care Act that is really, really dark and grim. Much more so than I think the reality would justify. And so I think that both he and many in his party, they've not really believed that if you began to take that away, people would suffer because they thought it was going so badly. But in fact, you have 20 to 30 million, depending on how you want to count it, who are relying on that bill for insurance and polling shows that they like the coverage they're getting. They like Medicaid, they like the private sector coverage. And that's a hard thing to take away. I don't think they quite realized how hard it would then be to offer something that was better. I will say one other quick thing which is that the Affordable Care Act's vulnerability, the things people don't like about it are the deductibles are high, the premiums are often high, not everybody is able to afford coverage. Republicans opportunistically took on those criticisms. Donald Trump said he would give you lower deductibles, more coverage. Mitch McConnell said the same. The problem is the Republican bills don't do that. Republicans actually believe high deductible care is a good thing. But having not made that argument, having told people they would do the opposite, they are now in a very dangerous place where they got a bill that is at odds with what they have promised. And the gap between their rhetoric and the reality of their proposal is beginning to stare them in the face. 

Well, suppose the president and Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan would come to you and said, listen, you know a lot about this, is there a way out? 

I think it's unlikely they will do that. 

No, I'm sure they won't, but -- 

You know, I actually think there would've been a way out for them and I wrote about this. The Health and Human Services secretary is a guy named Tom Price and he is a Republican congressman. And back in 2006, he partnered with a very liberal Wisconsin congresswoman who is now in the senate, Tammy Baldwin. And they wrote a bill. And what this bill basically did was it made it easier for individual states to build out their own health care programs. And it basically said that if you can create a program that we will vet it by experts. And if they say this will increase coverage and increase affordability, we'll give you some money to do it and we'll give you a lot of government flexibility and we'll let you take the Medicaid money and spend it a different way. We will let every state create the program that is best for them. Vermont can have single payer, Illinois can have, you know, an Obamacare-like system, Alabama can have something much more conservative. And I thought that that would actually have been a smart way to go on health care. For Donald Trump to come in and say, look, we're going to have a federalist plan here. We're Republicans who believe in handing control over to the states. You get to keep as a state all the Obamacare money, you just have to come up with something, it can still be Obamacare if you want. But if you can do better, and we believe you can do better, if you can do better, then you get that money, you can go take it and build something else. And if you build something better, then the other states can adopt it later. There is a plan I should say in the senate that has some of those features called Cassidy-Collins, it's a Republican senator from Louisiana and a Republican senator from Maine. It isn't exactly like I described but it does have some of that within it. But they decided to go and build a plan that would be one size fits all in Paul Ryan's office, do it very quickly, do that without really any input from outside stakeholders. And what they've ended up with, nobody really likes and so nobody is willing to walk the plank on. 

Was in the beginning the opposition to Affordable Care Act more a case of the mandates, the government is telling us we have to have insurance even though there are other cases obviously that can be cited where the government tells you what you have to do, that and the idea that they viewed it with some notion that it was a government giveaway? 

I think there is a lot of different streams of conservative opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Some of it had to do with just Barack Obama and generalized opposition to his administration. I mean, the mandate's point you make is a good one. But on the other hand, at the very moment when they pass that bill, you had nine or so Republicans signed on to a separate bill that had an individual mandate in it. So the idea that individual mandates were something, that was originally a Republican idea, it wasn't by nature offensive to Republicans. But look, what does the Affordable Care Act do fundamentally? It taxes rich people and cuts Medicare spending. And then takes that money and gives it to poorer Americans to buy reasonably generous health insurance. Every single step of that process is something that Republicans genuinely, legitimate valid way have disagreements with. They do not like increasing taxes on the wealthy. They think that is bad for the economy, in many ways unjust. They don't think that the insurance the government provides, if it provides insurance at all, which they are split on, should be that generous, they think it should be catastrophic really at best, particularly if it's being provided by taxpayers. And they don't like the government, many of them, having that much of a role at all. So a lot of different kinds of disagreements. The problem is those disagreements remain when they are talking about their own plans, too. The Republicans who want to cover more people and Republicans who don't. There are Republicans who want to stay within the general confines of the Affordable Care Act and Republicans who don't. There are Republicans who want to build a new kind of system and Republicans who just want to get the government out of it. And so you have a party that unlike the Democratic Party is very split on its goals around health reform. Democratic Party has a lot of arguments about means, but not so much about ends. The GOP has a lot of arguments about ends that were never resolved. Those disagreements got flattened out by the unanimity of dislike for Obamacare. Now that they have an opportunity to do something about that, it's like all those disagreements have come back to the fore. And I will say, the dangerous thing for them is they have a plan that I don't think they are prepared for the aftermath. I don't think they're prepared to defend 24 million people losing their health insurance. I don't think they are prepared to defend all the people who have higher premiums and higher deductibles after this. And so, you know, I think the success for them has been defined very narrowly as passing a plan but I believe this truly, Charlie, the worst thing that can happen with the Republican Party is they pass this plan, I think the disaster, the catastrophe that would follow it, they would perhaps permanent damage to the GOP. 

Permanent damage because if they go to the people in 2018, they will be roundly defeated? 

Yes, if you go, in 2018 the Congressional Budget Office projects that this bill will throw 14 million people off of health insurance in one year, either 14 or 18 million people. I don't think they are prepared for that at all. And I think the level of betrayal that would feel like to a lot of their voters, a lot of their downscale voters, who put Donald Trump in office and believed that he was going to make health care better for them. I mean, we at Vox, we went out and we talked to those folks. They said they thought he would make their health care cheaper, better, he would help them out. 

He promised all of that. 

He promised all of that. He said on "60 Minutes" -- it's very important I think to remember this. He said he would be a different kind of Republican. That he thought everybody should have health care. And the government should pay for it. That unlike other Republicans, he didn't believe that if you were poor, you shouldn't get good health care. He said you get to choose your doctor, you get to choose your plan, you get everything covered. Those are his words. Then he's got this plan that doesn't do that. He said, he promised there would be no Medicaid cuts. He didn't do that. The poll came out today from Quinnipiac. It found that by a margin of 56-17, people oppose this bill, 56 percent oppose it and only 17 percent support it. You never see numbers like that. And I think that is before it is begun actually taking health insurance away from people. So that is a wound that if the Republican Party inflicted it on the country, I think both it would do them a lot of damage but also the backlash it would create, next time Democrats got in, I think they would be able to pass something that was quite a bit to the left of Obamacare. 

You say that if in fact they pass this bill, a House bill and the one under consideration with some modification, it will mean terrible things will happen to the Republican Party and certainly members of the House as they run for re-election in 2018. Donald Trump and Paul Ryan are saying to them, if you don't vote for it, if we don't have a replacement, we have been promising and promising and promising it, our words will ring hollow and we will lose badly in 2018. So they are in trouble if they do and trouble if they don't. 

I don't think they have great options. But I think if you had to choose between the two options, I think it is better to go to people and say, well, we weren't able to do health care because we're still working on it but we did get you this big tax cut and we did get you this big infrastructure improvement, than to go to people and say, we spent our first two years taking health insurance away from you and increasing your deductibles and making it so your neighbor can't get coverage anymore. And you see that story on the news about that woman who had cancer and can't afford because she is not on Medicaid anymore. I think of the two of those, if I were a congressman, I know which one of those I would want to be defending. 

Also this, this is a test for President Trump's legislative abilities in terms of being able to fashion legislation as he has promised and he has big items coming up. Tax reform being one, also infrastructure bill being two, although that will come not this year, they have said. He worries and he should be worried, I assume, that it looks like he can't deliver. 

So something that has been a continuous theme for me in reporting on this has been how important it has been and how wounding it has been that Donald Trump himself is not more sure-footed and involved in the details of the legislation he's actually pushing. He is very uninterested in health reform, he doesn't like to talk about it, he hasn't really learned much about it even at this point. When he goes and makes cases to Republicans, they have been shocked, people in those rooms, by just how thin the case is, how little he will get into the substance of it. And I don't say this to bash him, I say it because it matters for tax reform and it matters for infrastructure. It is very hard when you are asking people to do big things and to do hard things, to get them there. And one thing you have to do as president is make a persuasive case. And also, yourself, know what you want enough, and know what the details are enough that you can, using your political intuition and using your political celebrity, get your party to a place that maybe it didn't originally want to go but is the right place for it to go. 

Ezra Klein, great to have you back on the program, thank you for coming. 

Thank you. 

We'll be right back. Stay with us. Michael Morell is here. He's one of our nation's leading national security professionals. He most recently served as the CIA's deputy director, and twice as its acting director. I'm pleased to have him back at this table. Welcome, sir. 

It's great to be here, Charlie. 

Great to you see you. 

Great to have you back. 

It's good to be back. Let me just start with this. This is this morning's "Washington Post": House Intelligence Chair Alleges Spy Agency Abuse. "The Wall Street Journal": "GOP lawmaker sparks new battle over Trump's spy claim." New York Times": "GOP leader puts new spin on wiretaps. Take me through this, unpack this because I don't think most of us understand what the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is saying. 

Sure. And Charlie, this is complicated. But let me start with the punchline. Let me start with the bottom line. This, in no way, this in no way, validates the president's claim that he was, or his associates at Trump Tower, were the target of surveillance by the Obama administration. It doesn't even come close to validating. 

Even suggesting it was ordered by the president? 

Not even close. So what did the chairman say to the media and apparently to the president? He said that he had a dozen intelligence reports that somebody gave to him. He didn't get them officially from one of the agencies. Somebody gave them to him and said, I think there's a problem here, take a look at these. A dozen intelligence reports that he said involved incidental collection of U.S. persons, incidental collection about Trump transition team members. That's what he said he saw. He also said that he was troubled that some of the names that he saw were unmasked. And we'll talk about what all of that means. 

Okay. 

Let's start with what incidental collection is. There are two types of incidental collection. In one type of incidental collection where you are collecting on two foreign intelligence targets talking to each other, so make it a foreign minister of China, foreign minister of Russia talking to each other, and in their conversation they have, they talk about a U.S. person. That is incidental collection on that U.S. person, okay? That's one type. There is another type of incidental collection, which is where you have a legitimate foreign intelligence target in a conversation that you collect, but in that conversation, they are talking to a U.S. person. So a foreign intelligence target on one end of the phone and a U.S. person on the other end of the phone. That is also considered incidental collection. Incidental collection happens all the time. Obviously foreign officials in their conversations are talking about Americans. 

Is that what we think happened with Michael Flynn? 

I think Michael Flynn was the second type. 

That's what I mean. 

Right. The second type, right. But incidental collection, incidental collection happens all the time. So the first question, and there is really three agencies where this happens. It happens at NSA, most frequently. It happens with the FBI in their signals intelligence collection. And sometimes it happens with the Central Intelligence Agency. Those are the three agencies where it happens. When it happens, it's very easy, it's usually very easy to see that it is a U.S. person. It is either the name, the phone number, the context of the discussion, they actually mention the person's name. So it is pretty easy to see they are either talking about a U.S. person or talking to a U.S. person. So the first judgment that the collecting agency has to make is, is there information here of intelligence value that we need to disseminate? And if the answer to that question is no, then all of that is discarded. But if the answer to that question is yes, there is intelligence value in this conversation, either about a person or with a person, then they disseminate that. Now I know NSA best when it comes to these procedures. And that decision about whether to disseminate incidental -- information that includes incidental collection is a very rigorous process at NSA. It's not just one person making the decision. It's one person recommending that it be disseminated and then check off, check off, check off, check off at higher levels. So that decision to disseminate that is a significant one. With regard to the kind of incidental collection where the U.S. person is actually talking to the foreign intelligence target, you can only, even if you decide to disseminate, you can only disseminate what the foreign intelligence target was saying. You can't disseminate what the American citizen, what the U.S. person was saying. So you can only say the Russian ambassador in a conversation with the U.S. person said the following. You can't say and in response the U.S. person said X, Y and Z. You can't do that. There are two cases and only two cases where you can actually disseminate what a U.S. person said. And it's rare. It is when they admit that they have conducted a crime, so yesterday I robbed a bank, yesterday I shot somebody, or they say they're going to commit a crime. So they pose an imminent threat. I'm going to conduct a terrorist attack tomorrow. In that case, this incidental collection, specifically about the U.S. person, can be turned over to the FBI to take action, to prevent, right, or to either solve a crime or prevent one. But that's it. That is really rare. So when a U.S. person -- very important for viewers to understand -- when a U.S. person is caught up in intelligence collection in a conversation with a legitimate intelligence target, almost never, almost never does something that person said get disseminated. The next big issue here is called masking. And Chairman Nunes focused a lot on this yesterday. What is masking? Masking is when you have incidental collection, for most people, for most U.S. persons, you can't use their name. So you don't say, you don't say the Russian ambassador in conversation with Michael Morell, or the Russian ambassador and some other Russian official talking about Michael Morell. You can't use the name, you have to say U.S. person, right. And if there is more than one U.S. person, it is U.S. person one and U.S. person two. That is the way it gets disseminated. There is an exception to that. And I think what the chairman had might be the exception. The exception, the exception is the most senior U.S. officials. And I think also senior officials in the transition, including the president-elect. The most senior officials don't get masked. So when two foreign officials are talking about the U.S. president, that doesn't get masked into U.S. person one or U.S. person two. They just disseminate it with the president of the United States; or, I would bet, the president-elect of the United States. I bet you that is some of what Chairman Nunes saw. 

Do you think that might have been what President Trump might have seen that caused him to form the belief that he did, that he articulates? 

It's possible, right, because he was receiving intelligence reports when he was the president-elect. He was getting a briefing as often as he wanted one, right? We know he wasn't getting it every day, but getting it as often as he wanted one, so maybe he saw some of those. Maybe he saw some about General Mattis or Rex Tillerson or Michael Flynn, right? So maybe he saw those, maybe that led him to think somebody is surveilling us. No, it is incidental collection. Now when you have one of these intelligence reports in front of you and you've got these masks == U.S. person one, U.S. person two, U.S. person three -- the most senior officials in our government, people at my level and above, when I was in government, so the deputy level and above, can ask NSA, the FBI, CIA, depending on who produced the information, they can ask for that information to be unmasked. So I could say to NSA, I need to know who that U.S. person is. Where it says U.S. person one, I need to know that and I need to know it for the following reasons. 

So to ask to unmask somebody, if you are the deputy director of the CIA -- 

Or higher. 

You got to have a good reason. 

You got to have a good reason. 

Right. 

And again, in the case of NSA. 

Who decides as to whether that's a good reason? 

In the case of NSA,
