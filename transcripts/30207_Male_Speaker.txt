Welcome to the broadcast. Tonight we'll talk with actor Michael York. We'll talk about the world of dance and choreography. Jacques d'Amoise will be here. Also, Gerald Arpino of the Joffrey Ballet. First, I want to talk about the Haitians that are currently being held by the Coast Guard after being taken from their boats headed for the United States. Over 4,000 people have fled Haiti since October in the wake of the coup which overthrew the first democratically elected president of that country. I want you now to take a look at this tape, and when we return we'll discuss with the filmmaker the Haitian crisis. (VIDEO) 

One day, on December 5th, Aristide had a meeting in 

It was basically the problem started when everything started to, you know, do what he called "clean up" of, you see, the public administration. So they started to fire a lot of people. And that (inaudible) a lot of anger. 

Aristide is not working on his power in 1990. He was working for that in 1981, '82, '86 after Duvalier left. We don't - 

Do you know where the burning tar comes from? It's because there's no justice in Haiti, so it's the only justice that people have. You have to understand that. 

No, Aristide hasn't told us to necklace anybody. The people just know who act against them since the day of Jean-Claude Duvalier. The priests could not have told us to necklace anybody. 

I stayed, come back Haiti, that's good. Yeah. 

No, I just keep wanting to say Wylans (ph) and I want to make sure. Joining me now is Andrew Jones. He shot the footage we just saw and is a professor at the School of Journalism at Northeastern University, and a former producer for >>ABC and NBC news. Amy Wilentz is the author of "The Rainy Season: Haiti After Duvalier." This is the book that she has written, "The Rainy Season," as I mentioned, "Haiti Since Duvalier." Also, Jocelyn McCalla who heads the National Coalition of Haitian Refugees. I think all of you for coming here. Clearly, there is a large contingent of Haitians in this city because we have seen them in the streets in protest to the political changes in the country. Before we talk to Andrew about the footage we have seen, give me a sense, from your perspective, of what's happening with respect to the refuges and what percentage of them - as you know, there's a great debate now about are these political refugees or are they economic refugees, and the response of the United States government to those that are fleeing by boat, and how the United States government is taking care of those refugees? 

Well right now there are some 4,530 Haitian refugees now on the Coast Guard that have been intercepted by the United States since October 29th. To me, the debate is really - it's really outrageous that this debate is going on at this point in time, in my opinion. And given the fact that Haiti has been under a repressive atmosphere with thousands of people having had to flee the country, the countryside, the urban areas, and so on and so forth, and the fact that United States itself acknowledged, it recognized that Haiti was suffering under a terrible dictatorship, it is totally outrageous that now respect to the Haitian refugees who have fled for their lives. They're not fleeing because they want to come to the United States, they're fleeing from repression. So, in that context, I find that the debate is simply very sad. 

Notwithstanding the fact that, I mean, the clear evidence that we have seen the overthrow of President Aristide and also the army takeover and the dictatorship that exists now. Is there clear evidence that that dictatorship is repressing these people and that they fear and have legitimate reason to fear political persecution? 

They certainly have a legitimate reason to fear persecution if returned to Haiti. We have been in touch with human rights groups in Haiti, with relief workers, with church organizations, and priests who have been in close contact with their parishioners and so on and so forth. What we have been hearing from them, and we have - also, I should add that we're also, daily, receiving information from Haiti compiled by a number of the human rights activists and advocates in Haiti. And the picture that we have been given is a picture where a demonstration, for example, or a peaceful show of support by students in support of Aristide, and the return to democratic rule is met with severe repression. 

Of what kind? 

Of what kind? Example, a group of students, about 100, 150, were picked up because they wanted to have a press conference and a meeting to express support for the government of Aristide while the OAS, the Organization of American States, was meeting with a number of political leaders. The military intervened, broke up that meeting, picked up the students, about 150 of them, as far as I understand, they brought them to the national penitentiary. And a section of the Port-au-Prince headquarters called the "Criminal Research Branch," in that branch they were made to go through a hallway, a very small hallway where rows of policemen set upon them with truncheons and kicked them, they slapped them, they kicked them with the butts of their guns, and so on and so forth. This is the kind of repression that has taken over Haiti. Now, we also know of people that have been killed in the streets and their bodies picked up and taken to a common gravesite. 

Okay. And when were you there? 

Well, I got back on November 12th. And I arrived on November 6th. But I think what's important - what I saw was that what's happening now is that the army, in cahoots with Joseph Nérette, basically has been organizing demonstrations that have a heavy participation of the bourgeois class, what the Haitians would call the "bourgeois class." And basically these are the elite and the wealthy, those who live in areas like Pétionville or Peguy Ville in the hills around Port-au-Prince. And what's significant here, there are a couple of things, one is you hardly ever see these people out in the street. You don't see them yelling slogans, holding signs, so forth and so on. So that means that there's an air of desperation on their part that's tied to the embargo, probably the loss of profits, the loss of money because of the embargo. And, also, a kind of political desperation is there, because no one can deny the legitimacy of the Aristide government. You can say that you disagree with Bertrand Aristide or this or that, but you cannot deny that he did gather at least 67% of the majority vote and the first legitimate election every in the history of Haiti. But I think what's important also is that the crowds are small, the demonstration crowds are small compared to those who were in the street during "Lavalas," which is the name that Aristide coined for his campaign last fall. Where, then, you had hundreds of thousands of people in the street, now you see 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 at most. And there's a liability here. First of all, before then, Aristide, before he announced his candidacy, Aristide was underground and there had been several, if not scores, numerous attempts on his life. So when he surfaced many people had the hope that there would be a legitimate democracy in Haiti. And they surfaced also literally thousands of people who supported Aristide when he was in hiding, took a political position against the powers that be who are in place now. So their lives are in jeopardy. So it's not just a matter of looking at Port-au-Prince; you have to look at Haiti at large where when I was there the estimates were that at least 100,000 have fled the city for the hills. 

Are they people that are fleeing now? 

I think many of those people are fleeing now. I don't think they have any choice but to flee because there's a sense of desperation. I don't doubt that - and people may disagree - that Aristide is going to come back. The question is the military that's in place, the Nérette government, there's kind of a constitutional chaos in Haiti right now. No one knows what's going to happen. 

Is there also, though, and economic desperation because of the OAS embargo and because of the general state of the economy in Haiti? 

You know, there's a saying that was told to me, and it was this, they said that the wealth are being hurt by the embargo but the poor have always been embargoed. The poor tell me that they've never had electricity, never had water, they've never had the benefit of private cars, so they can hold on as long as possible, and they're for the embargo. I talked to five supporters of Aristide in secrecy when I was there, and every one of them from young students to old people said keep the embargo in place, the embargo is hurting the poor and the embargo is hurting the ruling class, which is controlling the military. Let's put some pressure on these people to return what they perceive, and I think legitimately, as the first democratic elected president in the history of this country. 

Yeah. Put all this in perspective for us. This is Time Magazine said about your book, "'The Rainy Season' is a kind of world-class reportage that deserves honor as history' first draft, as journalism is supposed to be." The New York Times Book Review said, "a remarkable account of a journalist's transformation by her subject. The book offers a rich portrait of a country in a fitful transition." That transition clearly continues. 

That transition is continuing. I thought when Father Aristide was elected president I had the - I was under the mistaken impression that perhaps change had really begun. He says the change still has really begun and that this is just another part of the endless up and down that's been going on since the Duvalier dictatorship ended in 1986. I think it's important to remember that under this embargo, I wanted to say before, peasants all over the country are living the same way they were living before, but they are under threat from their old enemies. They started to organize under Aristide and before, and now their old enemies, the Tonton Macoute, the Duvalier paramilitary thugs, and the old army people who are all over the country are coming back to wreak revenge on the peasants, and those are some of the people you're also seeing in those incredibly overcrowded boats that are tumbling into the waters. 

And the United States' response? 

Well, the U.S. response is interesting. We upgrade the Hong Kong government for sending back Vietnamese boat people. We welcome with open arms the Marielitos who were criminals dumped on us by the Cubans, more or less open arms in any case. And then the Haitians, for some reason we just can't tolerate Haitians, even though they're probably political refugees. And I believe that there's a certain amount of racism that tinges this immigration policy. 

And what else though, other than racism, you think might account for the government policy? 

Well I think there's panic. They're afraid that there's just going to be a real wave of Haitians. And they say that they're afraid that if they let this wave in, then they're going to be encouraging people. But it takes a lot of courage to leave on those little boats. It's not just people who, you know, want to get a job in New York. 

It's not like walking across the border in Texas. 

It's not like walking across any border. It's very scary, as we've seen. A lot of people die. And the word gets back to Haiti. Everyone who goes knows what he's risking. So they're risking life and limb to get here, and that's because they fear persecution. 

Any sense that the government is changing, that the American position, because of the protests and because of those people that raise the question do we care about Haiti and do we care about restoring democracy there, that there is a rethinking of the U.S. position? 

My fear is, on the other hand, that the United States, because they wanted to repatriate these Haitians forcibly and were willing to talk at some level to the Haitian government, which they do not recognize, the de facto government, my fear is that there is some sort of diplomatic relationship going on under the table and that the United States, in fact, is lessening its support for the return of democratic rule and the return of Father Aristide. 

But is there any verbal evidence of that? I mean, I haven't heard anything that indicates that from the President or the Secretary of State or the - 

No, but a lot of these diplomatic things happen without our getting to see them. 

Aristide doesn't believe that, does he? He's not saying - 

I can't speak for him. 

No, but he's spoken out, I mean. 

No, he's never said anything. 

But he has said something. He has said he doesn't want to see - I think he has said that he doesn't want to see an armed intervention to overthrow that government, the totalitarian. 

He's spoken out against armed intervention. 

I think the issue of armed intervention is very interesting to me because I was in Panama in 1989 when the United States invaded Panama. And then the United States ostensibly invaded Panama to put a democracy in place and to uphold elections, and they called that situation "Operation Just Cause." In my mind, the cause for military intervention in Haiti is far more just than Panama, not that it's not my call. It's the call of the Haitian people. I think what we have to see here is that the United States government, and I think it's common knowledge, has always supported the ruling class in Haiti, which has in turn manipulated the military and used the military to oppress the lower classes. The United States has played that role overtly, its played it covertly. And I think recently, because of the incredible pressure put on by Aristide in the Haitian people, and I think this is something to understand, you know, that the Haitian people are very determined and this Lavalas didn't come out nowhere. It was part of a building up and an education and an organizational process that has been in place for about 60 years. 

And do you think the United States was opposed to its development and its building up? 

I think - 

Do you believe the United States and the Bush administration was opposed to the coming power of the Aristide government? 

I think the United States was opposed to the coming into power of the Aristide government to the effect that the Aristide government could effect its control over Haiti through its manipulation of the ruling class and the military, yes. 

The United States government was always opposed to Aristide. In cables of the U.S. Embassy they always called him a radical firebrand and he announced very late that he was going to run for president, and the United States had supported the electoral process up to then. They couldn't very well go back on it once they saw that he would be the most popular candidate and be elected. 

And then after he was elected, there was - 

They announced their support for him and they went along with the democracy, but I don't believe they were ever pleased at his arrival into power. 

In other words, the United States always wanted to put Aristide in a straightjacket. Aristide, without being free to say and speak his mind and to continue to express what people would be the best thing for Haiti would be a danger to the United States, and so he would not be under their control. 

I think the issue - I think he's right. I don't think the issue here is a personality called Bertrand Aristide. I think the issue here is a phenomena called self-determination. The Haitian people made a choice, their first legitimate choice in history, and now they're defending that choice against basically the same colonial forces that have been in place all along. 

And that's exactly why they don't want an intervention. That's exactly why the Haitian people do not want an intervention by the United States, and military intervention, to restore power. They're afraid that if the United States helps Aristide come back to power militarily Aristide will be exactly in the straightjacket that Jocelyn was talking about. 

But I hear the Reverend Jesse Jackson in New York over the weekend talking about the possible use, that military force should not be ruled out. I hear you expressing some support if the United States could go into Panama under whatever guise, that, in fact, that it ought to be prepared to do that in Haiti. 

Not necessarily. I understand your point. You know, sometimes when you get the dog in the henhouse you never get him out. 

Yeah. 

That's right. 

But I think also one has to consider that the blood of American soldiers has been shed in Panama, in Grenada, and in Iraq for far less of a just cause than what would be called upon, given the moral justification that's in place in Haiti. 

Yes, and Bush was very flippant in his dismissal of the idea of military intervention in the Haitian affair, and it was very condescending. 

And you think that's because it's racism or is it - 

No, it's because they support the elite in Haiti, the United States government does. And as Andrew said, they always have, and it's very hard for them to turn from supporting this elite, whom they know, to supporting a radical. 

You were there, though, Amy, at the time that Baby Doc was forced out, you know. The United States was pleased to see that, was pleased to see him go. 

I think they were pleased to see him go. The popular unrest was too much. They wanted to stem the tide of popular unrest by giving the people a certain feeling of victory, as did Duvalier, but as we always say, Duvalier-ism without Duvalier continued. It was a military dictatorship, pure and simple, from that moment on. So, really, the change hadn't even begun, although Duvalier had been asked - 

But at the time you write it, you were saying there was clear - on the part of the Haitian people there was a genuine anticipation at long last, democracy, the free market and all those things were coming so that they would all benefit from the change and the plight - 

That's right and that's what created the movement that elected Aristide. 

I think racism is in place. I think it's just like South Africa. I think you have the whites on the top and this place has displaced white authority called the United States - and I think you have the agents in between, which is the colored class, the light-skinned people, the "mulattocracy" in place in Haiti. And I think it's clear that on the bottom we have a majority of blacks. And I just have to say this, you know, for the Haitian people and for the sake of my own sense of justice, that I firmly believe that were these people white people in stovepipe hats in these ships off the coast of the United States of America instead of black people, they would be allowed access to this country, because, remember, let's about ideas. Supposedly our borders are open and supposedly these people are welcome here. I think we just have to come clean, Charlie, and just say that there's racism in place in this country and it's denying people access to the economic and political benefits of the United States of America because of the color of their skin. 

You wanted to say? 

Well I wanted to add something to say what the U.S. had been before Duvalier. In fact, essentially the United States supported - 

Before Duvalier? 

Before Duvalier left, in other words, United States supported Duvalier for a very long time. 

Papa Doc. 

Right. Well Jean-Claude Duvalier. And they only basically jumped on the bandwagon, when it was very clear that the popular rising was so large and so widespread that the Duvalier regime could not - was not going to win. 

Let me turn this to understanding all the things, what points have been made and the consensus among all of you, is what force could make the United States change? I mean, you fear that it's changing the other way, that there's kind of subterfuge to prevent a restoration of the Aristide government. What pressure or what force do you think might be - what power do the Haitian people, do people who are living in New York, have to influence the U.S. government? 

First, let's say that the United States government has been forced by the incredible groundswell that brought Aristide to power to change its policy. I mean, it is saying at least that it wants him restored, that it wants a return to constitutional government. That's a big change for the United States to be out there saying it. That, to me, is a little bit of a new world order. But I think that one of the most important things that can happen is for Haitians in New York and in Boston and in Canada and in Miami to demonstrate; that's been incredibly effective so far in the struggle. But also for the Haitian people in Haiti to continue their resistance, and there is resistance. 

I think non-interference, Charlie. I think that if you're not going to interfere militarily, then don't sabotage the opposition in Haiti through use of intelligence. 

Keep up the embargo. 

Right. Don't - right, keep up the embargo. Don't put capital - 

Well is there any lasting of support for the embargo? 

Not in Haiti. 

No, not among - within the elite against no embargo. Among the poor people, pro embargo, because, you know, you have to ask yourself where does the elite get its money? And I don't think it's any secret that the elite has been siphoning off millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars from NGOs over the years, and this is common knowledge within circles in the United States government. So you could say that this in itself is a form of intervention. So if you're not going to have military intervention, then don't have capital intervention and don't have intelligence intervention and don't have the kind of diplomatic intervention that would make it difficult for the people to restore democracy, if you're not going to have military intervention. In other words, balance the scales of justice. 

Okay. 

I would also add, Charlie, that the United States should do the right thing, welcome the Haitian boat people on the shores and in the spirit of Thanksgiving. 

On the spirit of Thanksgiving. 

That's right. 

And for good or until conditions are changed in Haiti? 

Well, until conditions change in Haiti and when democracy has been restored. 

But is it not clear - and I got to close on this though - that there has been - I think that the public outcry and the drownings have had some impact, either from public opinion influenced in the government, I mean, in terms of saying we've got to do something, whether it's we've got to find room on some of those Coast Guard boats or we've got to do something. 

That had an impact, but another thing that had an impact was a restraining order that was issued by a judge in Miami. Otherwise, the United States would have gone ahead with forced repatriation. 

I think it's the determination of the people. 

Wait. But hold on one second. That judge -- that order is only through what December 5th or something? 

It's not a long order. I don't know how long it is. 

Yeah, I think it's through December 5th. 

The lawyers are going to go back to court on Monday, and we will know by then what happens. 

Okay. The last word. 

I think it's the determination of the Haitian people, and that determination is exhibited by their courage to come out and elect a priest, a poor priest president of Haiti. 

Thank you. What happens to your film? How many - are you going to show it somewhere? 

Yeah, I've done a two-part series for Black Entertainment Television News. I have a piece coming out on WGBH in Boston. 

Terrific. Nice to have you. 

Thanks. 

Thank you for coming. When we come back we will talk about the - shift gears and talk about the world of dance. Gerald Arpino from the Joffrey Ballet is here, and Jacques d'Amboise. Stay with us. Back in a moment.
