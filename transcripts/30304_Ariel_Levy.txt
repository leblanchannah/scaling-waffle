Ariel Levy is here. She has been a staff writer at "The New Yorker" magazine since 2008. She was 38 years old and five months pregnant in 2012 when she traveled to Mongolia to report on that country's mining boon. On her second night there, she suffered a miscarriage in her hotel room. She told the story of that experience and the events that followed in an essay for "The New Yorker" in 2013. Now, she has written a memoir. It is called "The Rules Do Not Apply." I am pleased to have her at this table. Welcome. 

Thanks for having me. 

We have lots to talk about here. (LAUGHTER) First of all, you won a National Magazine Award for the piece. 

Yes. 

This book is, and that piece was, an exploration of meaning, is that a fair statement?. 

Yes, yes. I mean, I think that particularly with the piece, I wanted to talk about the kind of experience of being a female human animal. 

Yes. 

I think it's sort of the last taboo. There is no more taboos around women's sexuality. But the fact that women are actually animals and that really intense stuff happens to us around birth, menstruation, fertility, all the things in that sphere of our being in our bodies, I wanted to get into that. 

Yes. I mean, take me back even earlier than that, to the light that you had. I mean, when you went to Mongolia, pregnant? 

Yes. 

Happy? Yes? 

I was very excited I was having a baby, yes. 

For the baby? 

Yes. 

And you have this wonderful line and it says that for a small amount of time, you knew you were a mother. 

Yes. Well, I knew because I had a living baby in my hands. So, I -- for ten minutes, I was somebody's mother. And that was black magic. That was something. 

That's the word you used, "black magic." 

Yes. 

What do you mean? 

Well, I mean because then he died. 

Right. 

So it was the most painful experience of my life but it was also the most transcendent because before he died, he lived, and I experienced motherhood very briefly, and I experienced what maternal love feels like which is the most brutal. 

In that short time, you felt it all. 

Yes. I mean, I'm sure had he lived to be four is how old he'd be now, I'm sure I'd feel all sorts of other things that I didn't get a chance to feel. But I experienced that love, that primal, brutal maternal love where you think, oh, I would die for you without -- it's not even a thought. 

Wow. And you wanted to take a picture of him. 

I did, yes. I took a picture. 

Because? 

Because the whole thing was so shocking. I mean, it was so surreal to be in Mongolia and to have a living person who came out of my body. That had never happened to me before. And I knew he was going to die. And this was going to be it. This was going to be the only time that we had together. And I knew I'd want to see his face again. And believe me, I looked at it a lot. 

And every time you look at it, you have the same emotion that you just described. 

It's different now. I don't look at it so much anymore, but when I first got back, yes. 

When you got back then, what kind of condition were you in? 

Not the best. I mean, I was so sad, I could barely breathe. And I had a little identity crisis on my hands because a switch had flipped in my heart and I felt like I was a mother, and a switch had flipped in my body and I was making milk, I was lactating for a baby who wasn't there. So, in the deepest part of myself, I felt like I was a mother, but that was invisible to the rest of the world because I had no child. So, I was in a pretty profound state of grief. 

Did writing about it -- I don't want to use the word cathartic, but something. 

Yes, definitely something. I don't know -- I mean, I've only ever experienced that set of circumstances and then written about it. I don't know what the grieving process would have been like had I not written about it. But then again, I also don't know what it's like to not write about everything that happens because that's what I've always done. 

Let me talk about your life. I mean, your parents sound fascinating. 

Yes. I dig them. 

You dig them. Children of the '60s. 

Yes. 

Tell me about them. 

Well, they're both feminists. My mom really stressed my whole life that I could do and be whatever I wanted and she had a lot of faith -- she always said of course you'll be a writer. And I think that was a huge gift to give to a kid who wanted to be a writer. To say, like, of course, that is what's going to happen. And my dad is a writer too. My dad has written for like, any -- if you name any kind of lefty-group, like Greenpeace, or NARAL, or NOW, any -- name it, he's probably written some of their copy. 

There's a moment in which you describe him and say he wants you to be proud of the fact that he approved. 

Oh, of my first girlfriend. 

Your first girlfriend. 

Yes, he said aren't you impressed that I'm so cool with this? And I said, not really, like. 

Yes, I mean, why wouldn't you be? 

Right. It's only in keeping with everything about you, right, so, yes. 

But they gave you confidence and they gave you... 

Well, they were very loving and they -- my mom really believed that I could write, like she really -- she really always told me that's what's going to happen. So, I believed her, you know. 

Why do you think someone can write as good as you can? 

Oh, what a nice thing to say. 

That's true. I mean, you can read this. Everybody who knows, who's read this. 

Well, it's all I do, I mean, it's what I've been doing for 20 years. All I ever do is write things. 

Yes. 

So. 

Is it natural, do you think? Is it learned? Is it what? 

I taught a writing class at Wesleyan where I attended college. And I taught that class like a year ago. And I thought it was sort of like either someone can write or they can't. Like it was a joy to interact with these students, but, yes, I think some people have it. Like it's just what they do. That is just how they exist. 

You also came back and were divorced. 

Yes. Two weeks after I got back from Mongolia, my former spouse went to rehab, and -- 

For alcoholism? 

For alcohol abuse, yes. And it was not the first. It was not the beginning of the problems around that. And at that moment in time, I just felt like I just couldn't do it. I just felt like I couldn't do two recoveries at once and I needed to do my own. 

But you sent this to her. 

Oh, yes. Oh, I love her. She's very important to me. I sent her this to read before I turned it into my editor, Kate Medina, before anyone else saw it, she saw it, and I said if there is anything you can't live with, tell me, and I'll take it out. And she's a really generous, selfless person. 

What did she say? 

She said I'm not going to censor you, it's your story. You do what you got to do. 

But how is she today? 

She's doing really well. I'm very proud of her. 

Yes. And the irony of this is that you now have a relationship. 

Yes. 

With a man who is a doctor. 

Yes. 

In Mongolia. 

I do. 

Who is now in South Africa? 

No, right now he's in your green room. 

Is that right? So he's watching this? 

Yes, I believe so. 

Yes. 

Unless he fell asleep, yes. (LAUGHTER) 

So how did that happen? 

That happened because when I went to this clinic in Mongolia after I lost my son, there was this person there who I connected with and we started writing to each other, and at first, it was really my life line because, John, my doctor -- Dr. John as I called him -- was the only person who had ever seen what felt so intensely true to me, it was making me insane that it was invisible to the rest of the world. And that is, he saw, here is a mother with her baby who has died. And so, it's not like we would email about that night and -- but, it was a comfort to be interacting with someone who was there and saw that happen. And then it was just a matter of chance, we just happened to connect beyond that. 

Connection is one thing, being in love is another. 

Yes. 

And took a while. 

Oh, sure. 

Through emails and everything else. 

Yes. I mean, it was sort of -- normally, I think people would think it wasn't convenient if you lived in New York to fall in love with someone who worked in Mongolia and lived in South Africa. 

Right. 

But for me, it was convenient, because that way there was time for me to grieve and for us to fall in love sort of simultaneously because we couldn't see each other. 

Before this, nothing bad had really happened to you. 

Yes, not really, no. 

And then a terrible thing happened. 

This showed me that I had never actually experienced real suffering before, yes. 

Yes. And did you know how to deal with it? 

I don't know if anyone could know before they've experienced real grief and real loss. I don't know if you could be prepared for it because it's so all encompassing. I mean, I really felt like for a while I lived in grief. Like it was a tunnel I lived in. And then eventually -- 

Like the -- tunnel. 

Yes, it was not a nice tunnel. 

Yes. 

And then eventually grief became something that lives in me instead. 

So you lived in it and then it lived in you. 

That's how I think of it, yes. 

And today? 

Yes, I still always have a little part of my heart that has like a little hole in it for that baby. And also I'll always have grief for my first relationship, my first marriage. I mean, just because you get divorced and fall in love with somebody else doesn't mean you don't care about someone, so those are sad things, but it's okay. I just take them with me. 

And "The Rules Do Not Apply." Where does that title come from? 

Because I just basically thought that the rules that my mother and certainly her mother had to follow weren't relevant to me. It just didn't -- weren't there. I felt like I was the beneficiary of this enormous gift from the women's movement that made it so that I could grow up thinking that I was going to be the protagonist in my own life and I could follow my dreams, and I could -- 

And I can do anything. 

And I can fall in love with a woman and marry her. I mean, I had so many freedoms that were unthinkable to my mother or her mother. So there were -- I felt like I was living a different version of -- 

Is the book about feminism other than the fact that you're a feminist? 

In some ways because I think I talk a lot about becoming a writer who focused a lot, who focuses a lot -- 

You profiled women, that's what you did. 

I focused a lot on women who are unconventional. 

Right. 

And who have accomplished great things. So I think that's feminism, yes. 

Yes. 

But I also think writing about the body, what happens with women's bodies, I consider that to be part of the feminist project too. 

Yes. How's feminism doing today? 

Well, we've certainly got ourselves a powerful opponent to focus on. So I think when you have an election where you have literally the most competent, most well prepared woman ever running against the least competent, least qualified man ever, and the man wins, even after you heard him say that he thinks it's okay to sexually assault women, that's galvanizing. I do think that was the moment where women were like, wait a minute, this is not a joke. 

How do you explain, then, the women that voted for him? 

I can't explain it. I don't know why they did that. I don't understand. I don't get it. 

And even some women who said I don't want to feel like I should vote for somebody because they're a woman you know, I should vote for her because she's the most qualified candidate I've ever seen. 

I think she was a very qualified candidate. 

Barack Obama said exactly that. 

I think he was right. 

Yes. 

I think it would be a much more relaxing time to exist if she was running the free world right now. (LAUGHTER) 

Yes. If you were writing this over, would you change anything? 

I'm sure there's a comma here or a word there. 

I'm not talking about grammar. 

No, I -- I -- I -- 

Would you have included more? 

No, I wouldn't have. 

You know where I'm going. 

I just realized, sorry. (LAUGHTER) Took me a second. I didn't write about my relationship with John. 

Because? 

Because I did not want to write a book that ended with, "and then I fell in love." 

You don't want it to be a sort of sweetheart ending. 

Well, I didn't want to suggest, and then Prince Charming came and saved me. 

You don't want to give -- 

Because he didn't save me. 

You saved yourself. 

Falling in love with someone else didn't do anything -- 

What saved you? 

What saved me was after a while, surrendering. Like after a while, where I'd wake up every morning and think this is not acceptable. I don't accept this. It's not OK with me that my child is dead. It's not OK with me that my spouse is an alcoholic. I don't accept this reality. And then eventually, it became clear to me, whether I accepted it or not, it would be real, so I might as well to surrender. 

To go when you'd get up in the morning and say, I can't accept this, I feel like crap, but I can't accept this, to where you get beyond it. What does that take? 

Time I think. You just have to suffer and live through pain, and not try to push it away. 

So all these people have reacted to this so strongly. What is it that they are reacting to you, do you think? I mean, everybody, men and women, are saying about this -- Sheryl Strahan said, "I read "The Rules Do Not Apply" in one long sitting." I suspect lots of people who read this in one long sitting. A, it's not that long. 

I was just going to say a lot of people have told me that and I think it's because it's very short. 

Yeah, I was gonna say that, yeah. 

It's a very short book. 

I can't let you get away with that though. It is something else. It is that you're caught up -- you're caught up in, A, your life; you're caught up in where you were, what happened, and how you struggled to find another place. 

I think it's a coming of age story, I think it is a universal coming of age story. Even though the specifics involved -- Mongolia and miscarriage, and all these things that won't happen to a lot people, but we all I think go through a process where we figure out everybody doesn't get everything. And that's being an adult is admitting that and accepting it, and appreciating what you have. I mean, we all have to do that. 

We have to realize, men, women, and everyone else that you can't have it all. 

Absolutely, and I think -- 

Because time is finite. 

Absolutely. And I think there is an idea. I think there's a misconception that feminism said you can have it all. But I think the thinking that you are entitled to every single thing you want in life, that's not the thinking of a feminist. That's the thinking of a toddler. 

Yes, you said that, too. 

Yeah. 

That was a great line. 

And I don't think -- I think that's -- 

So toddlers do think they can have it all. 

Yeah. Yeah, they do seem to think that. 

So where are you now? You have written this book which has gotten enormous response. You're at "The New Yorker." 

Yeah. 

You're in a relationship. 

Yeah, yeah. 

So have you gone -- have you reached the other side, so to speak, having swum through, and having to swim through, you know, treacherous and dangerous waters? 

I think I have. Yeah, because I'm really happy and I feel really grateful, I feel the opposite of "this is unacceptable." 

And what do you think the lessons are? 

I think for me, this process disabused me of the illusion that I could control my life. I think that, as a writer, I had gotten accustomed to this kind of authorial power of crafting a narrative. And you know if I thought if I was diligent and strategic enough, I can get everything. 

Right. 

I could have it all, all the things I want. 

So the lesson is, you can't have it all, is that the lesson? 

I think the lesson is everybody doesn't get everything and that's OK. Like, the sooner you accept what you have and find what is in there to be grateful for, the lesser you will suffer. 

Does a writer get better because they live longer and they have more experiences and their picture of reality grows, or do they get better simply because, you know, they labor over sentences more and more? I mean, simply, there's a sum total -- there's an experience of getting better because you're doing something which you've labored over, experience. I mean, is it more the experience side and you've seen more life, and therefore your reference points are better or simply the skill of a -- 

I think not everybody does get better, right, I mean, it's not automatic. 

Well, you got better. 

I would love to keep getting better. I mean that's always been my aspiration. 

So how do you keep getting better, is my question? Is it because age gives you experience or is it because age gives you better craftsmanship? 

Grace Paley, she is one of my favorite writers. And I think it was so much of both. I mean, I love the way, in her early work, you hear that voice and then it becomes refined and aged. The same way Joni Mitchell's voice sounds all roughed up now from a lifetime of smoking and wildness. I love the way that happens to writers optimally. 

The book is called "The Rules Do Not Apply," Ariel Levy. It's a delight to have you at this table. 

It is great to be here, thanks. 

You can't read this without being profoundly admirable, admiring the way you can make sentences work. 

Thank you so much. 

Back in a moment, stay with us.
