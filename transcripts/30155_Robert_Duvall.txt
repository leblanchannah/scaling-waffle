most admired actors. His career started after college and a stint in the army when he came to New York and enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse. In (states) productions Duvall gained a reputation as an up and coming and he was soon cast in his first film, To Kill a Mockingbird. He has worked steadily ever since. His memorable performances are in films like The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, The Red Santini and Tender Mercies. His most recent film, A Family Thing, is a project very close to him. Not only does he star in it with James Earl Jones, but he came up with the films idea and he produced it and we are pleased to have him here this evening. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

It's great to have you. Was your father a military man? 

Yeah, he was. 

Admiral? 

Well he was retired Rear Admiral. His active ranking was a captain. He went to the Naval Academy when he was 16 and graduated in 1924. He was awful far for northern Virginia. 

So you lived in a lot of places I bet. 

Yeah, we did. We moved around. We were pretty transient. 

He ended up in Principia College? 

Yeah, in Southern Illinois. A small college that had a terrific little drama department. Wonderful. . 

Is that what got you bitten by the acting bug? 

Yeah, well my parents kind of shove me, pushed me into it. 

They said, "You're not going to be a mathematician or you're not going to be a nuclear physicist? Maybe acting is good. 

I tried other things but right. I took physics for eight days. It was kind of an expedient thing to get me through school at the end of the Korean War to kind of like gracefully get me through school academically. Then I began to really like it. They were the ones that kind of -- 

What did you like about it? 

I just kind of liked something that I suddenly could kind of do well and I started getting a few A's in school. The first production was The Story of Two (inaudible) by Bill Snyder, a wonderful young writer from he teaches in Southwestern Tennessee. It was a full-length mind play. The Story of Two (inaudible) where I play a Harlequin clown. It was wonderful. The man who choreographed it and directed it, Frank Parker, at0 (inaudible) college, he had been a dancer with Pavlova and then the (inaudible) who ran the Gateway (inaudible) theater at Bellport, Long Island. They went to that school. It was just a small group of people but it was Bobby Morris had gone there and Ricky Morris. It's wonderful. It was a wonderful little department. 

Speaking of the Gateway which is still there in Bellport you did A View From a Bridge there. 

Yeah, I first met a little (inaudible) and then we later did it off Broadway on a commercial run. 

What made you a star? What movie made you a star? 

I don't know. I think it was a gradual thing maybe. 

Yeah. 

I'm not sure. I think that I had a nice career of various jobs, theater, movies, television, and on this track I had just the Horton Foote projects starting with To Kill a Mockingbird, Tomorrow, The Chase, Tender Mercies, Convicts. Horton is wonderful. I never had another career that would have been a wonderful career but then I had this career. I think what it was a catalyst to put us all in to what you might call somewhat of stardom was The Godfather. Although I had done stuff before that had kind of propelled it. Guys, their careers went to a more obvious way than mine did. I've always been kind of a late bloomer. Now I'm kind of reaping the benefits of those earlier years more because there seem to be more parts coming my way now more than ever. 

How does that? What is that? 

I don't know. Maybe it's just my time. It's my time. 

It's better to come later than earlier probably? 

Yeah, earlier I had a good career too. It doesn't seem to diminish as I get older and I feel more confident. I always try to be diverse, always have been. I always told (inaudible) when I worked with him and the Neighborhood Playhouse. I said, "I always try to think of myself in the potential. Always in the potential state." Until I wrap it up I always look for new things. Fortunately a lot of different things come my way, diverse things. 

Does a time come when you are on that track, when you are in the playhouse, when you have Sanford Meisner, and a lot of people were there. Hackman was there. 

No, I actually met them. They weren't, actually they were at the Pasadena Playhouse. I knew Gene in New York. We would look for jobs together and he said, "This guy is going to come with a shock of black hair and sleep on my floor." It was Dustin Hoffman. We all met in New York but actually. 

(crosstalk) together. 

Not so much. We went over with (Lonny Chapman) for a while, Dusty and I did, but I started out with Sanford Meisner. It was like fear and trembling. It was like, ahh. 

Is that where you learned to act? 

Well it helped. I think I did summer theater before that. I learned certain things from Sanford. I think a certain thing, a character, I don't think that can be taught, which was stressed over there which was good. Improvisation the moment to moment work which I think is so important within the forum even. I think people that left and graduated from Sanford Meisner some of them lose that. Basically what he taught, and others do too I'm sure, was within the form of any given text there's always the ability to improvise with the forum. Go a different way each night or onstage or in film there's take two or take three. You can go a different way and feel free and relaxed enough to let it go a different way, a spontaneous way, within the form. 

Francis. Working with Francis. 

He was great. 

It was good? 

Yeah. See when I first worked with Francis it was in The Rain People. I think Rip Torn had been in that and I think something happened. They parted ways and I came in with Jimmy Caan who he was great to work with. After that we all tried out for The Godfather. He was always distant. I didn't quite get it with Francis. He was always kind of dark. I want to write a book someday called The Russians are Great, because all the directors come out of Russia saying how great, but Francis would come out forlon looking. 

He didn't get it. 

He was always searching. When we did Godfather one he still felt like a stranger to me, but I gained a lot of respect for him, a lot of respect because there was a standby understudy director following him around on the set. In case they had to fire him he would take over. The first AD was this understudy directors best friend. He really had to work under the gun with the powers that be in Hollywood, Copolla. I gained a lot of respect for him. 

It was Bob Evans at that time, wasn't it? 

You know a lot of people take credit but that film could have been made in Disney, it would have been made in that studio down in Wilmington, North Carolina, any place, as long as Francis was directing. It was his film. I don't care what anybody says. 

You think it's an American classic? 

Yeah, I do. Those first two. I mean that's really find film making. Wonderful film making. 

What made it that? The acting, the story, the idea that this was a story about America and this was a story about larger than just gangsters? 

Yeah, I think it was a bit romanticized. Somebody said when they read the book they turned the last page to look for an application to join the mob. But still it's wonderful filmmaking and I just think it was a mixture of things. At one point Jimmy Caan said to Francis, "What are we? You're going to take all the credit? You don't think we had something to do with the show?" That's pretty outspoken. I think that during the making of Godfather one from our point of view, maybe eternity wise it doesn't mean that much but I felt we were in something very special that was going to do well. 

Pacino was a big risk for him. 

A what? 

A big risk for Francis. 

Oh yeah. They put him in the gang who couldn't shoot straight. Then they got him back and it was a whole thing. It was kind of, but he was, I can't think of anybody who could play that part better except Travolta was now, bop bop, it's the last thing he did he can play that well. 

Some of his where he plays the bad guy. 

Yeah, the thing, Get Shorty. 

Oh, yeah, Get Shorty, it was great. I was thinking of something else he's done. 

He should have won the Oscar. He should have won the Oscar. He wasn't even up. 

Bu you think he should have won best actor should have been in 1996. 

Certainly right up there. 

Why didn't he get nominated? 

Who knows? Who knows? 

The politics of Hollywood. 

The other guy, the guy who did Othello, Lawrence Fishbourne, was excellent. 

He didn't get nominated either. 

Yeah. But anyway, that's whatever. 

Why didn't you do Godfather three? 

Well they said a lot of things about that. It boiled down to the fact that let's everybody admit that they were doing it for money. Why wait 20 years to do Godfather. Francis, well they were doing it for money. I said, "I don't mind taking half of what Pacino gets or whatever. Don't offer me like a fourth of what he gets or what others get. Let's be equal about this." They wouldn't so I said, "I pass." He came to my farm in Virginia, parked his car, came in. I sat him down in the kitchen. He always wanted my mother's Maryland crab cake recipe. I said, "I'm going to cook it for you." I cooked it and we talked a little about the movie. When he left he forgot the recipe. He called me up several times more concerned that he forgot the crab cake recipe then (crosstalk). 

(crosstalk). 

Then when I was in Godfather he said, "Well, I made the recipe. I didn't have it right but I made it anyway. It was as good as you." I said, "No, it wasn't." I'll give it to him someday. 

Then Apocalypse Now came later, didn't it? 

That was after Godfather two but it was before -- 

(crosstalk). 

Yeah, exactly. I worked on that for like six weeks and then came back six months later to finish the first half. It was really because Brando come in and the typhoons came. That was interesting working in the Philippines. That was quite interesting. 

Your relationship with Francis is good? 

I guess. I haven't seen him in a while. Why not? We could work together again. 

Why isn't he making films? 

I think he is. 

I don't know. (crosstalk). 

I happened to like Dracula. Maybe some people maybe didn't. I thought there was some wonderful things in Dracula. Maybe some of his earlier work is better. I don't know. A guy like that that's so talented, look out because around the corner he's going to come with something someday. 

You bet. He's got it to deliver. He just has to -- 

I mean when you take those two Godfather's, you take Apocalypse Now and you take The Conversation with Gene Hackman where Gene was so great, well you know, those were wonderful films. That's about as good as it gets in some areas. 

How many great scripts have you seen in your life? 

I don't know. It's all so subjective. We were talking about a terrific script that got made and wasn't done well I hear. Like Terry Malick, the great directory. He used to be wonderful writer. Now he's coming back. You see scripts sometimes, somebody said they want to make every year certain scripts join the five best films that never get made. Some never get made that are really wonderful scripts. I think that there's some really good ones around that you do see. I love the work of Horton Foote. 

I do too. Didn't he win a Pulitzer a couple of years ago? 

Yeah, he did for his play. He's just one of the best ever. He's a good friend and we've had a wonderful working relationship. 

You pretty much are to him what Jason Robards is to O'Neill, huh? 

I find a kinship with his work and I love Horton's work. We've done quite a few things together. When we were doing Convicts he'd sit there like this and he'd be reading and writing and I'd say, "Horton, can I try or Bobby try whatever you want?" He'd watch the take and then say, "cut," and go back to reading. So then we came in one day. I had to sit on a grave and talk about the convicts and I said, "Horton, we changed the whole thing." I sat on the grave and I suddenly made believe it was my mother I was sitting on. He said, "Oh, I like that." I changed the whole concept of the scene at that moment, sort of like an improvisation, but it didn't violate his script. He's open to that if it's done well. He's open to like, he's not so overly protective you can't let it wander a certain way, so long as his scenes are preserved within the form. 

The Great Santini. 

I enjoyed doing that. Yeah, I enjoyed. 

Did you draw at all knowing what the military life was like? Knowing and understanding the code? 

I think so. Some of that sense of being transient once again. That's why I don't mind traveling in the film business. Since I was young we've always moved. I never grew up with that sometimes wonderful thing of people in cities, they have a neighborhood with same friends. I never had that. 

Communities and stuff. 

I think some of that, yeah, of moving around. That character was different from my father. My father was quiet and more brooding. That guy was more overt and argumentative. 

Your mother was effervescent and passionate. 

In the book, The Great Santini, they talk about the military man comes home from a tour of duty imperceptibly the change of command goes from the wife to the father for the time he's home until he goes back on duty. In my family it was never that. My mother ran the show all the time. 

Even when he came back? 

Yes, yes. My mother was very strong willed. 

Just listen to this, when you think about a career beyond the Godfather, Apocalypse Now, and The Great Santini, Network, The Paper, Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. 

Yeah, I like that one. 

You liked that one? 

Yeah, a lot. 

Richard Harris. It was Richard Harris who I was talking about who acted with James Earl Jones in another and was talking about how they sort of, you know. 

I love that movie and I like also -- 

Why did you love it? 

I love the character, that old Cuban guy. Oh, I love that character. I like working in Rambling Rose so there's another wonderful writer and Martha Coolidge. Two lady directors. Some woman writes directly saying, "Bobby Duvall working with women directors?" I loved it. 

They thought you were too tough? 

Well no, women. I don't mind being direct by women as long as they have talent. Like with Martha Coolidge in Rambling Rose it was like a motherly presence behind the camera. With Randa Haines behind the camera it was like a very intelligent somewhat neurotic sister behind the camera. They are both talented ladies. 

You have a reputation for being tough, demanding, perfectionist. 

I like things to go right. I've had my moments on film with directors but I think a lot of people do. I try not to make it an indulgent thing and hopefully it doesn't become that. Whenever you have conflicts hopefully for the betterment of the film. 

You fight for principle as you see it? 

Yeah. Sometimes on the spot things flare up but then they calm down. I think that's all part of the work process. I've worked with actors who tend to sabotage the thing. It can't be to sabotage it can only be to help it. 

Sabotage it on purpose? 

Yeah. I won't mentioned names but in one incident it was like sabotaging the project. 

Well that would seem to me if you were on the project you'd be a little PO'd about that. 

Well, you've got to be careful about how you handle it. Somebody will quit. I just wanted to get through that experience. It was strange experience. 

And move on. 

Even if sometimes things become a little difficult it's for the betterment of the project, not to be detrimental. 

Have any of your projects been just collecting a paycheck and not because you really? 

Perhaps, perhaps. I try to make it not that but some you're more emotionally involved with than others, you know. I would have to say my favorite part of all time was Lonesome Dove. 

I would think so. Why? Is it you? 

Well you know when I met Larry McMurtry years ago he said I should play Colonel Call and a lot of people said that. They offered me Call. I said to my agent, "Look, you have a good working relationship with James Garner," he was going to play Gus. I said, "If you call him up you handle him and he switches parts I'll be in this project. Otherwise, I won't." My wife, I was separated at the time. 

They had given it to him? 

They had offered it. I'd played parts like Gus on stage but not on film. More and more muted, but the people that knew me the best said, "No, you're more like Gus." Even the author said I should play Call. He said, "I'll get on the phone." So he got on the phone. Four hours later he called me and said, "James cannot do this part because he can't be on a horse. He has a bad back." I said, "Well, go after the other part. Otherwise I don't want to be in the movie," because I've done that part before. Tommy Lee was wonderful but Tommy was good for that but I wanted to play this other guy. There's a certain part of me that could play that people hadn't seen. Maybe more in theater. 

(crosstalk) 

If somebody says, "When's there going to be another Lonesome Dove?" I said, "Not for another 100 years." This character is like Shakespeare I think. 

Why? 

English play Hamlet and King Lear, that's wonderful. I'll play Augustus McCrae. He's like a modern day knight, 1880s knight by horseback, saving women, loving women, loving life. It's a very indigenous guy to our culture and Texas culture. Texas is like a separate country anyway. 

But you saw yourself in that character? 

Yeah, I did. 

Your sense of passion for life. Your sense of passion with theater. 

It was such good writing it could draw you along. I did research, not a lot, the final person I saw, something told me to go. I went out and found Sammy Baugh the old quarterback of the Washington Redskins. Just the way he gestured. 

I remember Sammy Baugh. 

To this day I don't think he knew who I was, but I went out and saw. 

Just the way he gestured. 

Just the way he gestured and how he threw a pass. Somehow I got this gesture from this guy. We said goodbye to him and shook hands. I still don't think he knew who we were really. Way out in the middle of nowhere in Texas. He was 70 years old. He was like a Texas Ranger. Straight as an arrow. Still a warrior as an ex-football player. 

Why wasn't that made into a feature film rather than for television? 

I don't know. I guess they figured, and maybe in a way it's better, because you couldn't make it. It would be hard to make an eight hour film. In that way was another thing to develop that character over those four episodes was a wonderful luxury. You couldn't do that in a feature film. I think now, I would have gone off Broadway to play that part, but I think that television was the place for that, at least from a selfish point of view for developing that character. 

To really get time to inhabit the character. 

Absolutely. You couldn't do it in two and a half hours. 

Stalin. 

Yes. 

You said once, "You can't play evil. You have to play behavior." 

I think so, yeah. That was the hardest thing I've ever done. It was tough just going over there, like somebody said, "You're going out on history in an anthropological way as an American playing a Russian in a Russian country." It was very difficult but I enjoyed the experience in a strange way. I know it had mixed acceptance and somebody said. Why did you use accents? It was an English guy. I said, "Why do you English play and that thing with Sean Connery and all the Russian Admirals with English accents, why shouldn't I give some hint of believability to that?" I know some people liked it, some people didn't like it. I was told, and I didn't know he was still living, but (inaudible) father was like six foot eight. He was Stalin's personal poet. He's about 88 years old now. He told (Yvonne Passer), he said that I touche the soul of Stalin. I'm going to believe them rather than the Washington Post or some of these periodicals who really don't know anything about acting, I'm going to believe that more than I am the negative. I'd be in trouble if the reverse were true and he said I was terrible and these certain other people in these periodicals say -- 

If the critics loved it people who knew Stalin said you didn't get it then you would feel worse. 

Exactly. If this guy said that it was like a very touching thing. 

Do you know what he meant when he said that? Do you know what it was about your performance that somehow for them said, that's Stalin? 

I don't know. I just know that it's tough to play in those miniseries because a lot of time you are playing history. There's a lot of speeches where you end up playing history. You end up playing kind of a verbal thing. I do feel that the final scene with my daughter, and this is as good as I've ever done, because a lot of it was half improvised. I made up stuff and it just went a certain way that I felt was very Russian. There was an Armenian actor that said to me, "When you play this part," I don't know what it means to this day but yet I do know what it means, he said, "Remember the east." That oriental thing. It meant nothing to me yet it meant something. Somehow that meant something to me. In that final scene it all worked. Maybe other scenes didn't work as well but maybe in that scene I captured something that would make Mikhalkov say that. 

Do you understand anything about his meanness, I mean his evil? 

No. No, I just finished playing Eichmann. With my company, the little Butchers Run with TNT, with a wonderful company to work with, a little easier than HBO. I don't mean to get into politics here but Turner's outfit and Billy Graham directing. Arliss Howard, a wonderful actor played Malkin. 

And you played Adolf Eichmann. 

Like the writer's said, which is so right, you know, I can't play evil. He doesn't think of himself as evil so I can't play that. I have to play a guy that goes to work every day, drinks water, talks to an intelligent talk show host, and comes into a city from Virginia. It's the same kind of thing as Stalin. Same thing as Eichmann. His point of view, except maybe on a certain night, he doesn't think of himself as evil. 

What's interesting about this character is that you've got all those interviews that have been published with Eichmann. You remember they went in there and there's a guy who is part of the Israeli department of justice. We interviewed him, and interviewed him, and interviewed him, and they got all this stuff. 

I never got any kind of -- 

Never guilt. 

It was all, not only following orders, but it was the law of the land so therefore strange guy. 

Did you understand him at all? Can you understand somebody who was part of the enormity of that genocide? 

Once again, once again, no. A lot of people in that position would have done the same. A lot wouldn't. Look at Watergate on a much less scale, trivial by comparison, that the guys that bailed out, bailed out, and the others who didn't went to jail. There's some point maybe the consequences would be too big if they bailed out within that Nazi system of government. I don't know. From his point of view he is not evil and from Stalin's point of view he's not evil. They were just doing their duty, so to speak. 

Let me talk a little bit as we close about your obsessions. Horses. 

Hobbies become obsessions. You try to do them as well as you do your profession. Sometimes you can't. Arliss Howard called me several years ago and said, "What did you do when you were a young actor in between jobs?" I said, "Three things. Hobbies, hobbies, and more hobbies." It keeps you off of dope. It keeps you out of trouble. It keeps you hopefully on the straight and narrow. If you try to go after a hobby with as much passion (crosstalk). 

So horses and you did everything with horses and then you come back to it. You also had an accident very similar to what happened to Christopher Reeves. 

I did. My horse flipped. (inaudible). It was named after the best tango dancer I ever saw. He won a big grand prix in Ireland. I made a lot of money off of him. Before that I used to exercise him. We went over a small series of jumps. The horse flipped. I flipped. I hit on my head. Several days later I rode in the little horse show locally and then that night I got a massage, which I think you're not supposed to do. The next few weeks it was pretty uncomfortable sleeping. Fortunately it was not like what he went through. I hope that he recovers as quickly as possible. 

Tennis. You were obsessed about tennis. The story is not only did you play though, you went to tennis late. You were middle aged when you -- 

Yeah. I was about 35, 36. 

35 or 6 and you started winning celebrity tournaments. 

I won some. I won some in doubles. Doubles. Ronny Holmberg and I beat Chuck McKinley when he was over the hill and a guy that was 200th in the world. Ronny was a good friend of mine. 

(crosstalk). 

We did pretty good. I was okay. I wasn't the best in show biz. I was one of the best. 

Who's the best you think? 

Dabney Coleman was. 

Dabney Coleman was, really? 

Yeah, he was. I beat him in doubles but not in single. He played all his life. When you play against another actor you're going to play full. 

The guy who was in Eight is Enough, the -- 

No, the best of all was the kid. He beat McEnroe twice in six months. Vinny Van Patten. 

Vinny Van Patten. That whole family is obsessed. 

Vinny was a, you know if had stuck to it more, he's a wonderful. That kid could do anything. He could do anything. He's a wonderful athlete. 

Tango. 

Once again you try to do things when you get older that if you were younger I think I would have a really great crack at that. 

At being a tango dancer? 

Well, you know club dancer. Not professional. I do okay. 

What is it about it for you? 

It's just something. I can't explain it without being, I don't want to be pretentious or anything. I just like it very much. I like it only the way they do it in the clubs in Argentina, the milonga. Not the professional. Not the choreographed. I've written a script on it I'm going to do in several years. Two cities, New York and Buenos Ares, of the underworld. 

Don't you have a tango dancer that you (crosstalk). 

I brought a guy up, a great guy. (Salvatore Rayanal). He's teaching classes in my barn. Before I split with my wife we built a beautiful barn. We had a sleep at the wheel play, so he's up giving clinics in Tango. His wife came up today. 

And you are getting better and better and better. 

It's like when you start late on something but it's something I have a good feel for and it's like physically I have to warm up because maybe I'll have to take up a little yoga to get more limber, but I have a good feel for it. I'm what you call a milonga. I can hold my own. A club dancer. This guy. He's a wonderful guy so I get a little better and then -- 

Danella (inaudible)? 

Yeah, Danella Maria are also people here who teach. I only hang out with Argentine's to learn because it's an ethnic thing. They don't dance it they walk it. It's a certain way they walk. The Americans when they learn to tango do not want to learn the walk. American's sometimes they want to get to the fancy stuff. There's a simplicity about it. It's very nice. I just like it. You try to get a little better and a little better and enjoy something. If you have an obsession you try to enjoy it too, on the best days. 

It's great to have you here. 

Thank you, sir.
