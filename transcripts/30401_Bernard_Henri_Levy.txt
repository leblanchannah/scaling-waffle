We begin with politics this evening, not American politics but French politics and European politics. French citizens will go to the polls this Sunday to cast their ballot in what could be the most highly contested presidential election in the country's history. The 11 candidates include Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, who are running neck and neck. The vote takes place at a time when the French people are on high alert following yesterday's terrorist attack in Paris which left a police officer dead. Jane Hartley is a former United States ambassador to France. Philippe Corbe is a correspondent for French radio, RTL. Alessia Lefebure is director of Alliance at Columbia University. And from Paris, our friend the philosopher, author, and filmmaker, Bernard-Henri Levy. I am pleased to have them here as we look forward to the election which takes place, the first part of this election, on Sunday. Bernard, tell me what the mood is in France as you see it from Paris, and what's the prospect as we look at it this evening? 

The mood, first of all, is very sad. It is a mood of sorrow because of the terrorist attack of yesterday night and because of the death of this brave policeman and the two others who were heavily wounded. So there is a sort of veil of darkness on France and on Paris today which you can really touch with your hands. This is the general mood. Now, the prospect is that Mr. Macron is still running ahead. Not exactly neck to neck with Marine Le Pen. Marine Le Pen is a few points behind him. So you have Macron ahead, Marine Le Pen number two, and you are very close to them in this handkerchief, which in this poll today, the extreme leftist Mr. Melenchon and the classic liberal Mr. Fillon. 

Is there anyone trending? Does anyone have momentum? 

Yes, there seems to be -- this is of course a good question. There is a momentum since one week in favor of Emmanuel Macron, an image of progressivism, of liberalism, and of youth, which clearly matches with some expectation in France. This is a long trend -- long -- in one week, momentum. Since yesterday night, there is probably a sort of momentum, but not so strong as it could have been expected for Mrs. Le Pen. This terrorist attack yesterday was aimed at that. ISIS votes for Le Pen. ISIS and Le Pen are sort of twins, and the aim, the target of Daesh yesterday night was clearly to improve the vote for Le Pen. I think ISIS failed, in a way, because the momentum is not as big as expected. 

So what do you think the impact will be of this attack? 

Well, I would say that Madame Le Pen may win but with several conditions. She needs to have a -- 

May lead in the Sunday vote. 

Yes, she may lead, and may win eventually, but she needs a very low turnout, and I don't know if the attacks yesterday night will really lead the French people to stay at home Sunday. I don't know. That's an important question, the turnout Sunday. And the other thing is, in fact, if she wants to win in two weeks, she wants to be, in fact, with Fillon, the conservative candidate, and not Macron. So there's two conditions and I don't know if the two conditions are really -- you know, if we can find the two conditions on Sunday to give her the hope to win in two weeks. I think she's still trailing behind Mr. Macron and Macron has not been defeated by the attack yesterday night. She is still frontrunner, of course. 

President Obama called Macron? 

Yes, he did. 

What impact might that have? 

You know, President Obama made it quite clear he was not endorsing any candidate in this race. I do know, because when I was there and subsequently President Obama is incredibly popular in France, and at one point, there was a beginning of a write-in campaign, I think you may have seen it, with posters all over Paris asking -- 

At the same time, he went and campaigned in a way against Brexit and it didn't have the kind of result partly because the people appeal to the young people, either did not vote or -- 

I think it's a positive. But I will go back and I don't remember, one of the previous guests said this, I mean, Macron has been leading pretty consistently. Now it has been very tight lead, and he and Le Pen have been neck and neck, you know, a point or two apart. Fillon has come back a little bit recently. I think the most positive poll showed him at 20, so maybe three or four points behind, and Melenchon had some momentum which may have stopped. And I think Bernard is right that most recently Macron, in the last few days, has the momentum. And it's important, I think, as you look at Macron as a candidate and how he's tried to portray himself -- I worked with him quite a bit when I was over there -- was, what will the future of France be. 

Hope. 

It's hope. That's where it is similar to Obama. It's optimism. It's hope. We obviously have to make some changes, but it's particularly addressed at some of the young people in terms of what he's going to do in terms of education, what he's going to do in terms of apprenticeships. And I don't think the attacks -- I mean, I have not seen a poll in the last day or so, but we had elections when I was there, both after Bataclan, November 13th, and after Nice, the elections in France, it did not really move the needle. 

Let me talk about Melenchon, what kind of impact -- and who does he take votes from, this popularity, that he has shown surprisingly, even though he's been a long-time fixture in French politics. 

Yes. Surprisingly he's taking votes with the young people, some of the other young people. 

He's sort of the Bernie Sanders, some have said? 

Some have said that -- I would personally, strongly disagree because when you look -- I mean, of course, there is something of that, like a senior politician, very experienced, but getting the votes of the young people. But, at the same time, if you look at this program, it has nothing to do with Sanders. Sanders would be more similar to the socialists. Melenchon is strongly, strongly nationalist, so it's not a France of diversity, it's not a France of the minorities, it's not a France of tolerance. He's very hard-core on the secularism in his conception of secularism. There is no religion at all. You know, these things, I don't think we can make it closer to what Sanders had in his program. At the same time, I would completely agree with Jane, half of the young people, those who succeed, those who are all over the world, in universities, those in Columbia, New York, et cetera, they love Macron. Macron for them is the future, the start of technology, they embrace completely this kind of France that helps the momentum of these young people. The other half, those who feel a little bit threatened by the globalization, those who struggle with the employment, those who are scared about their future, those vote for Melenchon. There is no other alternative for them. 

Bernard, there has been some slippage in the campaign of Le Pen and in her popularity. Is it insignificant but, nevertheless, what caused it? 

One thing you have to remember is that one month ago Marine Le Pen was ahead of the race. Today, she's 20 percent or so. One month ago she was 30 percent. So she has a very negative momentum since a few weeks. This is very important to know. She's losing -- she was until yesterday night, until ISIS decided to vote for her, she was losing speed every day. This is one thing which is very important. Number two, you asked about the phone call of Barack Obama to Macron. In France, I'm sure of one thing. It is much better to be endorsed by Mr. -- by President Obama than by President Trump. Marine Le Pen is endorsed by President Trump. Not good for her. She is endorsed by Putin and Trump. And really, it was very bad news for her both of the endorsements. Macron is endorsed by Obama, which is a much more decent endorsement. Number three, one thing I would like to say at the end of this campaign, that it was a terrible campaign. It was one -- probably the worst campaign I ever saw in France. Maybe in America you know the sort of campaign, you saw that before us, when argument are replaced by punch line, when the debate is considered as sort of macho, box or something. This was the atmosphere of this campaign and it was not really worth and at the level of the great -- of the real republican and democratic spirit in France, as your last campaign in America, which was also hopeless. These are the fundamentals of this campaign. In this devastated political landscape, there is Macron who is swimming up. 

OK, let me ask all of you this. She has essentially -- she's an anti-immigration candidate. She talks about what it means to be French, as a campaign. She talks about her anti-European Union philosophy. People talk about a French exit from the European Union to follow Brexit. Can she seriously win this? Does she have a real chance, unlike any National Front candidate before? 

I think -- let's say she may win. I don't want to say that she's going to win, but she may win. We have to take into, she could win. We have to take into consideration the fact that she could win. And what happened last night in Paris is a way to remind us that a lot of things could happen in the next two weeks. So we don't know exactly what's going to be the mood of the French voters next Sunday, and this Sunday in two weeks. So she could win, but she is -- I'm not sure that her anti-euro, anti-European Union, Frexit campaign has been very successful, because she has tried, as Bernard-Henri Levy said, she has tried to run with this platform. It didn't really work well. Because in fact, she came back to, in the last ten days, the core values of her campaign -- immigration, security, Islam, et cetera, because she realized that the only way to make the electorate stick around her is to bring back the right, far right basics of her party. But when she tried to expand to economic issues and European issues, it didn't work that well, in fact. 

If she should win, though, and exits the European Union, exits the euro, does it destroy both? 

I think it's a huge problem. First of all, I agree with you. And I think just one point that -- and Bernard, I think talked about it -- France is a different election because it has a second round. So it would be like if our election -- 

No, I'm actually talking about if she wins the second round and becomes president. 

I think the second round makes it much harder for her, and that's what we've seen in terms of the Front National in other elections. I think if she wins, it's a huge problem for Europe, absolutely. I mean, she's talking not only about perhaps leaving the European Union, she's talking about going back to the franc. I mean, frankly, it's not just a huge problem for the European Union, it's a huge problem for France, economically. It also, I know when I was there, France was probably our key partner in terms of counter-ISIL, both on a military front, and on a domestic security, intelligence, counter-terrorism front. That would be a huge blow. France is very important in terms of what it does in the world, and what she would do is try to take France both economically, foreign policy, militarily out of the world. 

Well, the idea of Europe came, in part, from the French. Go ahead. 

The polls, the last one, they say that she could win only if she's against Melenchon, right, that she would not make it against Macron and she would not make it against Fillon. Yet, even if she doesn't win this time, a lot of people are worried that she might win in five years from now, right. So I think the lesson, the important lesson to keep for us is that this election, devastating campaign, is showing that the political parties are meaningless to the people, this traditional division, left, right, with the socialist, I mean, all this traditional -- you have seen the Benoi Hamon score. The socialist party used to be very powerful in France. And even Fillon, in the end, he is not doing as well as his predecessors, not only because of the scandals. I think people don't -- the traditional divides between the left, progressive, and social welfare, and the right, more conservative, on the moral values, and liberal on the economic point of view, this is not working anymore. So we have, as we said before, on the one hand, a few candidates of the future, and the candidate of the nostalgia of the past. And this doesn't match the political party division. So I guess the important lesson even if Marine Le Pen is not appointed -- elected now, is that we have to prepare for five years, for the next election. 

The turnout though, I know you mentioned it, I know Bernard mentioned it, is key. Because when we have surprises in these elections, it's when, usually, there's a low turnout. 

That's what happened in 2002 when National Front was qualified for second run with a low turnout. 

And they won, they got into -- I think -- 

May I take a bet, my dear Charlie? (LAUGHTER) 

Okay, go ahead. Give me your -- offer the bet. 

I'll take a bet tonight that Marine Le Pen will not be president of France. No chance, no way that she can become president of France. She's not perceived -- really -- she's not perceived as a social rules candidate. She's not perceived as so different from her father than she pretends to be. And number three, she's perceived more and more as having a very strange relationship with her own country. There is one thing which begins to enter into minds of the voters, which is, that since five or ten -- five years, each time our country, France, has to face an enemy in a diplomatic ground or a military ground, she systematically took the party of the enemy. When France had soldiers on the ground and in the air in Libya, when France has special forces in Syria, when France has a real arm wrestle with Putin about Ukraine, she's always on the camp of the enemy. And these -- the French are patriots. And they know that she's not a patriot. 

OK, but let me ask you this -- do you believe she'll make the second round? 

I think so. Yes, probably, because of the vote of Daesh, because of what happened last night. But she will not be so much -- if she's on the second round, she will not have such a big advance related to Francois Fillon. Francois Fillon is not a bad candidate. Francois Fillon, I do not vote for him. But he has a good program. He would be a decent president and Republican. So she will not -- if she's in the second round, it will be for, with short advance. 

And Macron would be the toughest person for her in terms of her possibilities in the second round? 

If Macron is beating her now -- Bernard, he's beating her in the second round by about 20 points, I think, at the moment. 

But we're going to see Sunday night if she's at 28, 29 percent of the vote, and Macron is at, I don't know, 22, 23, it's going to be much more difficult. And we don't know what the right-wing, the right-wing voters, the right-wing members of the conservative party are going to do. 

These are people who might have supported Fillon? 

Oh, yes. Some voters of Fillon may vote Le Pen. But it's -- it would be very, very difficult to imagine. 

The question is, will they vote, also, I mean, that's the more -- because -- or vote for none of the above? 

Other than what we've talked about before, in terms of immigration, and in terms of -- what are the big issues of this campaign? What else are they talking about as issues? 

What they talk about or what the French want to hear about? 

Well, go ahead. 

Because they have talked about meaningless things most of the time. But the concern for the French are not different from the concern of the Americans, of the other Europeans today. And I think it's a sort of whole package, with all the threats related to the globalization. You put into this cultural identity -- Islam. You put into this the euro, you put into this the European Union perceived as a danger for the economics, you put into this all sorts of unemployment, the fact that the recession is still there. Francois Hollande has not managed to change this. Economic opportunities, jobs -- I mean, it's always the same. I think the French are like anybody else. 

Go ahead. 

During the campaign, it's the case everywhere in the world, when you are able to bring the conversation on your personal team, when you are setting the agenda, in fact, of the campaign, when you're leading, you're the one who decides what's the conversation. We don't know exactly what the conversation in this campaign. I couldn't say, oh, the main topics -- the main topic of the campaign was that or that. We don't know because it's very difficult. The campaign, as Bernard-Henri Levy said, was nasty. We talk about the price of the suit of the candidate of the conservative party. It's crazy. We don't know -- yes -- and people -- 

The biggest issue was that for sure. 

Exactly, the biggest issue, one of the biggest issues of the campaign was that. It's crazy. 

The biggest issue was to know -- when he gave back his suit to the tailor, the biggest issue was to know if it was a proper suit or others -- 

Crazy! 

For American viewers, Mr. Fillon accepted suits and -- 

But the real deep issue underneath -- because we are not completely lost in translation, thank god, we French -- the biggest issue underneath were probably foreign policy issues, nationalistic or European, Putin or not. Yes, I think they were governing secretly the debate. And you have Marine Le Pen, who is very favorable to Putin, Francois Fillon, who has some indulgence to Putin with Putin also, -- the same, and you have Mr. Macron who knows more or less who is Putin, and how France has other alliances than Putin. 

She went to the Kremlin. She was in fact at the Kremlin a few weeks before the election. You're seeing that the President of Russia is trying to -- to -- to say -- 

To affect the French election. 

Yes! 

You mean the Russian President would try to affect the election of another country? (LAUGHTER) 

That's very new. 

I agree on the Putin comment. But I tend to think -- now I've been gone for a long time, and Bernard, you're there -- this is more on the role of France in the future, and what will in particular be the economic role of France in the future, and what will be the economic benefits or what changes? Because as we know, the French people have been sitting with around ten percent unemployment for a very long time now. And when President Hollande decided not to run, it really wasn't because of his foreign policy, or his national security, or his counterterrorism. It was all because of where the economy was, and it wouldn't budge. So if you look at these four candidates, they have very different visions of what they want to do on the economy in France. With Fillon and Macron probably being the most similar, but Macron definitely being more centrist. Melenchon and Le Pen are at both ends, but have some of the same policies. 

And Fillon. 

Fillon is -- Macron is more center, Fillon more center-right. But when I was there, and we did quite a bit with IPSOS at the time, and once again, it could've changed -- a huge amount was, what is the future of France, what is the economy of France, what is the hope for France? 

How do we see ourselves? Are we optimistic about the future? Do we see the glass half empty or half full? Do we still have hope for greatness for France? Do we believe that Europe is maybe the best way to be strong again? It's like -- 

Could you use the argument Sarkozy made in his first run? 

Yes. All the campaigns, every five years, all the campaigns, they are around unemployment and economics -- 

And the role of the state in the economy. 

Yes. But what makes this one very different, I think, and those who have been to France recently, I guess they would agree, is that people are still under shock by both the immigration, the wave of migrants from Syria, et cetera, and by the terrorist attack. And that's why I insist on the cultural identity threat. 

Thank you all. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

We'll be right back with Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft with an interesting new idea to assess the data about government spending. Stay with us. Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft announced a new project this week. The L.A. Clippers owner and largest stockholder in Microsoft is launching, USA Facts, it is a comprehensive nonpartisan data platform that tracks government spending and performance. I sat down with him on Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York about his career and about this new venture. So let me just start back to where you were. When you look for -- when you had the question that you know you wanted to answer, how is government money spent, and you went looking for that, had anybody else tried to do this? 

You can find everything in our site. You can find someplace else. I mean, we didn't create anything original except the structure around the data. So the answer is, yes, on every topic. And there are actually some very good sites that pick certain of these topics and do them very well. I saw a great visualization the other day of how government money gets spent. That's super. You don't see many places where people are adding together state, federal, and local data. That's pretty rare, because most governments present themselves government by government. But everything out there is available. Part of the question is bringing it together. If you say how many jobs are in food preparation and service, you will find the Bureau of Labor statistics website. 

Yes. 

You may not navigate it very well, and it may be hard to correlate that with other things going on in the economy. 

Who's going to use it? 

I hope what we get initially is people in the government field, journalists, I think, will benefit, and what I would call the most engaged part of the citizenry, people who read the kinds of publications that regularly cover things in some depth, in some use of numbers, and that would certainly point to the great national newspapers and magazines, "The Economist", the F.T., "The New York Times", "The Wall Street Journal", et cetera. 

Why do you feel better about how government money is being spent? 

I thought there were a lot of pockets where you could really -- you can debate the money is not being spent on your priorities. I thought we would find a lot of pockets where things just looked very expensive relative to output. And I don't think -- at least I didn't feel like I found that. Take transfer payments. I think transfer payments are about 2.4 trillion, if I remember correctly. So that is Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, SNAP, and some other stuff. So that's 2.4 trillion on spend to 5.4 trillion. Well, you can agree or disagree about how much of that we should do, but the truth is, you know that money goes straight through to purpose. People are eating the SNAP dollars. People are spending their Social Security money. I feel good about that. When you look at the people that work in government, I feel pretty good, actually. What people were doing -- I don't mind spending that money. Government pensions, they look high. If you look at government pension costs compared to private sector pension costs or private sector 401(k) contribution, that looked a little bit different to me. So I went through, sort of category by category, in addition to profession by profession, and I felt a little bit better about effective use of money and, as I say, reasonable people can disagree about what to spend on. 

How do you ensure that it's bipartisan? 

Numbers don't know whether they're liberal or conservative, at least last time I checked. Adjectives may, but numbers don't know. We haven't actually informally shared our work, our annual report and some of the other documents with people who are clearly Democrats, people who are clearly Republicans, i.e. politicians. And I got no feedback to the -- about this thing being partisan, none whatsoever, not from Democrats nor Republicans. 

The idea of takeaway, I mean, you talked about the fact the government is doing better than you imagined, other takeaways for you? 

Yes. And I'll be careful because it's surprises that are important. I'm not going to give you my policy, my personal policy views, they're not relevant. For today and in this work, I'm only partisan about three things. I'm partisan about the numbers. My wife and I, in our philanthropy, are clearly dedicated to trying to find a way to have private and public money, giving opportunity to kids to live the American dream. And I have to say I sort of think over the long-term balanced budgets are a good thing, I don't understand companies not making money, and I don't understand how you sustain yourself long-term. But whether that means increasing taxes, decreasing spend, the democracy should figure that out. That's not the point of this work. So with that as context, what was surprising? I ran through a few things. I'll give you another one. We did an analysis of how much money it took, inflation adjusted, to be in the middle quintile in 2000 versus today, versus 2015. It actually takes lower income to be in the middle quintile today than it did 15 years ago. That's probably not a very good thing. When people say the middle class is getting hollowed out, maybe that's what they're talking about. I don't know what the middle class really is. I'm a numbers guy. So I just say, hmm, this must have something to do with income quintiles. That would be another example of something that was surprising to me, to see actually laid out numerically. 

At this stage, where do you think government money is being spent badly? 

Again, badly depends on your political view. Let me take the simplest one. I talked to you about -- 

But you have said you were pleasantly surprised that you thought it was doing better. 

Right. 

Now, why can't you be pleasantly surprised or presently disappointed because you thought it was doing worse? 

That's based on my values. I don't want to complicate this discussion with my values. 

I'm asking about your values. 

No, I don't want to share them because it's sort of not important to the dialogue. The dialogue is about what the numbers say, it's not about what I happen to value, it's not. Let me -- 

Can't you make a judgment about values? 

Let me pick one that you'd think everybody can agree on, but let me pick it. Okay, so bridge quality has improved dramatically since 1980, dramatically. Transportation, investment in transportation infrastructure is up. Somebody might say, oh, that's a great correlation. Somebody might say -- and we haven't had that many bridge accidents, traffic fatalities are down, there is not a lot of bridge collapse fatalities. Somebody might look at that and say, let that continue to go, it's going well. Some mother with their baby in the backseat might say, I can't stand the fact that nine percent of the bridges in the country are structurally deficient. I can't take that. That's way too hard for me because I value my baby. So is that a good set of statistics or a bad set of statistics? People have to decide. Take the economy. We have a table and an annual report where I call it the knobs and dials chart. At the top, we have, like, ten things government can do to stimulate the economy. At the bottom, we have a bunch of outcomes. And we do this stuff over time because oftentimes government stimulation can drive things up and then you will see a phase down or a decline. You can look at that chart and some people will say government action has a huge impact on the economy and some people may say it seems to be uncorrelated. And we've had people look at this table and say both. So value judgments by me are not that important. I'm not a politician. I'm not running for office. I never will. I'm just a guy with a bunch of numbers trying to make sense of the world. 

Okay, do the numbers though tell you that the government needs to do a better job, the government needs to do more, and it needs to be a better divide between public-private contributions in a philanthropic way? 

Well, we're focused very narrowly in our philanthropic work. We are not medical research people. We are not hospital construction people. We do give to our alma maters, but I'll put that in a separate category. Long live the University of Oregon, long live Harvard and Stanford. 

Oregon is your wife and Harvard is you. 

Yes, exactly. So great institutions that we'll support. But when you focus in on money that goes to support disadvantaged kids, in many, if not most, of all the not-for-profits we work with, 50 to maybe 80 or 85 percent of their funding, which is still insufficient versus what they do, but it comes from government contracts. So, yes, is it important? Sure. There's a whole contracting industry out there funded by government to provide social services. So, is that money well spent? On the philanthropic side we're very focused in on that. Most government dollars are not spent, at least in the social service sector, with a pay for performance mentality. You pay for the number of kids processed, not whether those kids are getting good outcomes through the system. You pay based upon the number of people who go to jail, not the number of people who stay out of jail. The notion of performance-based contracting, we think is very important, but that deals specifically with our interests, the one I'm willing to cop to publicly, I think that money can be better spent. But I will cop to that one publicly. When I think about balancing the budget and blah-blah-blah, everybody here is an expert. I'll just give you the numbers to make your case. 

Where is the human element in this? 

The two biggest things that we did human element was try to decide how to explain what government does, and that's where the Constitution wound up helping us. 

Right. 

Part of the problem with government databases is everybody's got a different taxonomy about what government does. You know, what are government's actions? Then you wind up going to all these databases and you think government does millions of things. In a way, it does, but in a way, it can be simplified. That's part of the human element. That's part of decisions we made. I think they're impartial, nonpartisan, and unbiased, but they're human decisions we made, not numerical decisions. Which parts of the population should we really study in terms of how government impacts? We pick the family types, the income levels, race and ethnicity is more obvious. We decided that we will look at 65-plus. So we did make some let me call them "human decisions" before we got up to bat to present the information. And we present it in a certain context. We decided what -- at least for our first version -- what's material and what's not material? Somebody asked me, can you tell me what's spent on the National Park System? I wasn't sure we had it. So I went and typed in our search bar, National Park spending. Guess what? We don't have it. But we do have the total numbers of acres that are in national parks, in natural forests, et cetera. 

So where will this be in five years? 

I hope you will have -- the most important thing I would hope is we have the same missions and submissions. So we have consistency in presentation. And I hope we have a much broader set, much more data. But we continue to have a simplified way to present it, but with tools that let you just dig in and find exactly what you want. What is reading proficiency for fourth graders in Mississippi versus California? And you want to correlate that with education spent in, let's say, L.A., since we have a basketball team, versus Oxford, Mississippi. 

They're called the Lakers, I think. (CROWD LAUGHING) 

I'm leaving, we're done now. That was a real cheap shot, Charlie. 

Yes, it was. 

Los Angeles Clippers playing tonight against the Utah Jazz, go Clips! To be precise. Now you really got me off target. Anyway, I was talking about something -- 

Where do you go in five years is my question, and what are some things that you have to have that will accelerate its growth? For example, connection to a big search engine, that kind of thing. 

Well, that's certainly one, connection to the search engines. So literally you could go to Bing, my favorite search engine, or Google, and literally pose the kind of question you can. What were -- how many arrests were made for murder in a certain year? 

Right. 

You would like those to come back as answers if we get well hooked up, so we have a lot of work we need to do. I think the most important thing we'll do between now and then is to try to bring the data alive. Wouldn't it be great to have a debate once a week, once every two weeks on You Tube, on Facebook live, where you have somebody from the left and somebody from the right debating a topic, but anchored. You've got to look at the same data. It's being vouched for its integrity. And people can't get away with saying things that are just not right or are framed in adjectives that are not supported by numbers. 

Let me talk about some other things, too, in the 15 minutes I have remaining. And the Clippers. Let's talk about the Clippers. Is the joy of owning a basketball team, an NBA franchise, everything you thought it would be, because you, at the games are -- how do I say this -- a crazy man? (LAUGHTER) 

It's everything I hoped for and more. It is so cool. I'm actually sitting here at the table with Glenn Hutchins who I've known since we were in college. 

Connected to the Celtics. 

Owner of the Boston Celtics. We just made a deal that if the Celtics and the Clippers in the finals, we're sitting together. But I think Glenn would agree with me. You know, losing is not fun. I got to tell you. Losing at the buzzer to the Jazz in our first playoff game, ahhh! That was not fun. But if you want to have the fun, you've got to take a little pain along with it. 

When you and the board at Microsoft decided that you had different visions for the company and it was time for you to leave, how was that for you? I mean, you have been at this company, you built this company, you had remarkable success, you'd become amazingly rich, and now you can still be amazingly rich, but you weren't doing day-to-day what you had been doing all your adult life. What do you go through? 

Well, my life plan had been to work and then have a second phase of life. I always wanted a second phase of life that I would hit before I was too old to really enjoy it. My plan had probably been to work another couple of years, past where I worked -- 

You were mid-50s when you did this. 

Yes, and I probably planned to do that until my youngest son went to college, so a couple of years, three years longer. But at the end of the day, I made a decision that if we couldn't agree on strategy, it made sense for me to go. That was fine. It's tumultuous. It's always tumultuous when you stop doing something you've done for 34 years. But what really happened was I had this sort of principle, I was gonna work hard to the last day. So the last day, okay, I'm done and I haven't planned anything about the future. What the heck am I going to do? Thank goodness my wife challenged me. I got involved philanthropically. Thank goodness that, you know, this USA Facts thing came to mind. And, at least from my perspective, and maybe our fans, thank goodness, the L.A. Clippers was forced to be sold and I was there. I had already looked at three NBA teams to buy. I knew how the math worked. And it was like this manna from heaven that the Clips became available. So I won't say it was quick. I probably had a tough year. 

Microsoft, it's done, many say, really well. Stock prices have gone up, benefiting you as the largest stockholder. How do you assess why they have been so successful since you left? (LAUGHTER) 

Let me give three comments on that. Number one, I think they're doing a great job. 

Right. 

I do think they're doing a great job. 

Do you approve of your successor? 

Yes, I do approve of my successor. I think they're making the right strategic moves. They've got to make more, better, faster, but they're doing a good job. 

Wait, they got to do more, better, faster strategic moves meaning they're not doing as much, they're not as fast, and they're not -- 

Right, and I would have said that when I ran the place too. More, better, faster. More, better, faster. I'll say that about my successor. More, better, faster. But I think they're doing a great job. 

Okay, but let me just ask. What keeps them from being more, better, faster? 

There is so much to do in any tech business. You just have to keep pushing yourself relentlessly. I'm not being critical even in the slightest. But I do know the industry moves quickly and you better move quickly with it, so that's number one. Number two, I think they've done a great job reestablishing the image of the company. How much has really changed versus how much has changed perceptually, I can't comment. One thing I did tell the board when I was going was, my successor will have a better opportunity to change the perception of the company including its stock price than I would. I'd been doing what I'd been doing 14 years. People weren't going to say, oh, everything changed overnight. I think that's an advantage my successor had, Satya Nadella. 

So he got a fresh look? 

Yes, and I think he's done a great job with that too. It's a little different, but how you're perceived is often important to actually how well you do. So that's number two. Number three, I will point out that the hot products that they're promoting today, we all started on my watch. I feel pretty good about that. Number four, I want to see more profit growth. Profit really hasn't grown much since I left. I know in the tech world today, not making money is cool, and you get high market caps. But still, I'm a big believer in profit growth. 

Is that the proudest thing you did in terms of, say, the last -- in terms of your tenure, how you made the huge lift in profits? 

I think I'd say yes, but I'd also say, you know, we started Xbox, we started Bing, we started Surface, we started Azure, we started Office 365 all on my watch, I'm very proud of that, and the team in place today was largely the team we had in place when I left. And my successor found those folks all worthy of staying in their jobs. He's a guy I identified as a high potential star within a year or two of him starting in the company. So those people, the team, I have great pride. The profit, I have great pride. And the products, I have great pride. 

Greatest regret? 

Greatest regret remains I think the company should have gotten into hardware sooner. 

I thought so, yes. 

That's my mistake. 

Why didn't you? 

People can disagree. Apparently the board disagreed. 

Apparently Bill disagreed. 

Apparently, yes. The company's still doing hardware. I think it's probably fair to say the biggest miss was our position in the phone business. I think the phone business, it's very hard to have a business case for doing phones just with the royalty. 

Right. 

Google does it by forcing their search engine into the game. Their search engine is a money machine. Apple does it with the gross margin. 

Right. 

I think our model, trying to reproduce the Windows model in phones, was flawed. I pursued it for a long time, but it was fundamentally a flawed model. 

You couldn't put Windows into phones. 

You could put a derivation of Windows into phones, you just couldn't get paid for it. 

Yes. 

The question in a lot of these things just isn't what the product should be, it's how do you monetize the technology that you built. And Apple and Google both had a monetization approach, hardware and search. We never had a monetization approach, which means we didn't invest in the right way. We couldn't get our product boot strapped and at high volume. I would approach it differently if I could do it again, but I can't. 

Yahoo. You were prepared to pay big dollars. 

I would look like a genius if we'd actually bought it. If you take a look at what I was willing to pay versus the value of that asset, touchdown. 

Mainly because of the investment of Alibaba. 

Absolutely, absolutely. That would look like a perfectly good investment. Plus, putting Yahoo and Bing on the search side -- 

Talking about 40 billion, something like that? 

Yes, something like that, 30-something. 

Right. 

33 bucks a share, whatever that meant back then. But you put the two things together, there would have been a lot of synergy and speed to market that took a lot more time and the cost benefits didn't accrue as much to Microsoft in the final partnership we did, as they would have if we had acquired. So I think, with ten years of hindsight, because about ten years ago, I think, we first proposed the acquisition. It wouldn't have looked good five years ago, but with ten years having passed, I think that would have looked like a great acquisition. 

When you look at the future, Cloud has clearly been a huge part of Microsoft's success today, where do you see the future going? What is it that's going to be -- what are we going to be talking about? 

Well, I think it's probably fair to say that I spent two and a half to three years working on USA Facts because data wasn't very accessible. 

Yes. 

So in a sense, what you would really like to do is have technology that you can express your interest in a topic, and the artificial intelligence, if you will, that lives in the Cloud is smart enough to say I'm not just going to bring back one data element the way search does. I'm going to bring back a picture of what's going on in this area. I'm going to understand intent. I'm going to work off of intent. And whether that's preparing me for my visit to the economic club, looking up the bios of everybody at the head table because they're all in my agenda, could have looked them up, presented them to me, if it understood my intent. I'm interested in government spending. It doesn't take me to some random web site where I might find what I'm looking for. It actually brings back to me a picture of government spending. So the notion of technology software understanding intent and being able to harness data to serve intent, however that comes about, there will be magic words, was machine learning, it's artificial intelligence, it will probably change two or three more times. But that's where I think there is a lot of opportunity. Virtual reality, augmented reality, in a way, they're part of intent. I have on my little augmented reality glasses and I look at you and it shows me your bio because it recognizes who you are. When I'm 85, I may not recognize who the heck you are, but at least there is a laser shining into my eye, assuming I can still see it, and actually the laser will work better than my eyes were because they can tune automatically to my vision. Anyway, this notion of technology that recognizes intent and serves you based on that I think is super important. 

We look at what Elon Musk is doing in driverless cars and we see where Apple is going to make a big push into driverless cars. We assume, they haven't spoken much about it, is that something Microsoft would have been interested in? 

You have to ask current management. 

But I said might have been interested in, because a lot of it is driven by software, as you know. 

Yes. I would say it is interesting but it's a little bit like the phone. You have to pick the right go-to-market approach. If all you're writing is some software that's in the back end that gets embedded in cars, there might not be a lot of money in there. You might spend a lot of time trying to convince automakers, you might get there slowly, but it might be the right approach or the right approach might be to build a car which is what Tesla has done. It sounds like it's what Apple would do. Google might approach it differently. So there is two reasons to get the business model right. One is so you get paid and the two is so you get your product to market quickly. If you build a bunch of software and then you're begging G.M. and Ford and BMW, and you don't get to market quickly, the guy who builds their own car might get ahead of you. On the other hand, Tesla doesn't build many cars in the grand scheme of things. Maybe that's not the best way to get there. 

They've got a hell of a market cap, don't they? 

They sure do. 

Let me just talk about core competence quickly as we end here. Core competence, Steve Jobs, what was it? 

I think Steve had a unique ability to put together familiarity with technology, as well as a sort of understanding of what makes sense to consumers and conceptualizing product. I think that was a talent. In my world, anybody who can do one magic thing in business is great. Most companies are not, or start-ups don't do -- let me call it a single trick. They talk about a single trick pony. Most businesses are zero trick ponies. Successful businesses are at least a single trick pony and almost nobody does more than one trick. Steve Jobs did more than one trick. He did do Apple II/Mac and he did do, let me just call it the i-Series -- 

Right. 

iPhones, iPads, et cetera. That's amazing, two tricks. I think Microsoft did two tricks and that's why I think part of Microsoft is amazing. But I would say that was certainly a great skill of Steve Jobs. 

Jeff Bezos. 

Jeff Bezos is certainly a guy who has bet for the long term. He has pushed position into multiple areas. I marvel at the market cap they have, and I wonder about their long-term profit streams. I think what they're really focused in on is commoditizing a lot of industries, taking the profit down and having them benefit from their huge scale. And yet, they haven't proven the benefits at least in terms of profitability from having that scale. 

Bill Gates. 

Bill Gates. Super energetic businessman, able to comprehend and really see the market opportunities in himself. A decent product conceptualizer for sure, and great at mobilizing technical talent. 

I think it was Steve Jobs who once said that Bill was more Rockefeller than Edison. 

That was a way to kind of give a backhand compliment. I think that's way overstated. In the grand scheme of things, was Bill a better businessman than Steve Jobs? Probably. Did Steve spend more time on really product creation? Probably. Are they both incredibly amazing people who did amazing things? Yes. So I'm not sure it's really important to debate who's Rockefeller and who's Einstein. If somebody said, I was close to either one of them, I'd feel pretty good. (LAUGHTER) 

Yes, exactly. (APPLAUSE) All right. One last name, one last name. Steve Ballmer. Core Competency? A reliance on data, we know that. 

Yes, I think my core competencies do have to do that I can really go through and try to form a simplified picture of a fairly complicated topic. That is a USA Facts core competency, but it was also core competency when I was running Microsoft. I'd say that's probably part of the reason why we make as much money, Microsoft makes as much money as it does, is the ability to see those opportunities through the numbers. The other thing I think is a core capability for me is bringing teams together, pointing them in a direction and getting them fired up. I think I'm pretty good at that. I've got a lot of energy, I got a lot of enthusiasm. In order to be good at that, you also have to be good at simplifying things. I think I have the ability to simplify, you know, we're only going to have four goals, let's follow them, let's go! Of course, if you're pointing people the wrong direction, that's very bad. Charismatic leaders who lead you over cliffs, you would be better off not being a charismatic leader. Leadership is about being excited and firm and clear but it is also about getting the ideas right. And I think that's what kind of really helped at Microsoft. Bill was very helpful in getting the ideas right and I was very good at bringing them to action. 

Thank you for coming to New York Economic Club. (APPLAUSE)
