Kati Marton is here. She is a journalist and an author. She has written eight books including "Hidden Power" and "Enemies of the People" which was a National Critics Choice Award finalist. Her latest book is called "True Believer: Stalin's Last American Spy." I am pleased to have her back on this program. Welcome. 

Thank you, Charlie. It is great to be back. 

Tell me who Noel Field is. 

Well, he is a mysterious figure from the Cold War who was used by Stalin to basically try to destroy the American system. So many, many parallels with what's going on today in terms of Russian attempt to undermine Washington at the highest levels. He was an idealist who was captured -- 

He was a true believer. 

-- captured by a faith at an early age and then it became like a drug, communism, Stalinism, hard-core Stalinism. And he set out to do good in the world and ended up doing terrible damage all in the name of this faith, destroying his family, first of all, and then tried to destroy his own country, all for Stalin. 

There is also this, your parents who were journalists in Hungary. 

It's a strange intersection. The reason that the story of Noel Field hasn't been known until now, although he played a huge role in the Cold War, was because Stalin didn't want him ever to talk to Western media after the torment that he had been through, which I'm sure we'll get to, the torture. But my parents were the only journalists who ever found him in his hideaway in Budapest, my hometown, during the chaos of the Hungarian revolution. And surprised the man and his wife who had asked for political asylum in Hungary, afraid to come back to America, because he had been unmasked as a Soviet spy by then. And so the only existing interview with Field was one that my parents did. And I was the fortunate beneficiary of that. But a lot of pain went into that. 

Did you discover that or had you known about this for a long time? 

I had heard -- When my father was freed from two years of maximum prison, same prison that Noel Field was in, he told us that as his jailer was leading him to his cell, the jailer said, congratulations, you got the VIP cell, recently vacated by an American agent. And the VIP cell did not mean a cell with a Danube view, it meant more bugs and surveillance than any other. And this name Noel Field, I was a little kid then, but the name stuck in my head. And then flash forward many years and I'm reading my dear friend, Arthur Schlesinger's memoir, "A 20th Century Life," and up pops the name Noel Field. And I thought, is this the same Noel Field that those many years ago my father spoke of? And so I started researching and indeed, it was. And I found his surviving family members who also were in the dark about what exactly happened to this man who disappeared behind the iron curtain. 

So what happened to him? This is your story. 

So what happened was that he was kidnapped by Stalin's goons. He, mind you, was serving the KGB, but when Stalin needed -- at the end of his life, advanced paranoid -- needed to get rid of his perceived rivals, he decided to use this American who knew all the communist big shots in the Soviet empire. And because they were all working for the same cause, he had him kidnapped from his hotel in Prague and drugged and then tortured into confessing that he was not KGB, as he was, but CIA, and that all his comrades who Stalin wanted to liquidate were also CIA. So in one blow, Stalin was able to execute all of these people through the confession of this one American. 

Clearly, I mean, that was an act of what? How would you describe what it was for Noel Field? 

Well, he was -- 

He had no choice or he believed or -- 

He was a true believer, as the title says. He became such a passionate servant of this terrible, destructive ideology and had made so many sacrifices. He had given up a lucrative -- promising career as a diplomat in the State Department. He betrayed his country. And his own family didn't know that he was an agent. And he was a product of that time in Washington, much like today, where people were searching for an answer to every problem and the problems were abundant. Ten million unemployed from the Depression and a Washington that just prior to FDR launching the New Deal, was really starved of ideas and capitalism seemed to have failed. And here was communism selling a bill of goods that this generation, many of the best and the brightest, believed. And Moscow picked out those that were vulnerable to seduction. They had talent scouts searching for people who seemed somewhat alienated and idealistic, and yet, positioned for big careers. 

What happened to the family? 

Absolutely crushed by this man who never told them that he was working for Stalin. And in fact, tried to lure them in to the craft of espionage. The heroine of this saga, whom I just loved writing about -- you know, writing a book is like a marriage, you have to like the subject. 

Yes, right. 

And Noel Field is not the most lovable guy. He is complex and interesting but his daughter, Erica Wallach, was just a force of nature. 

Adopted daughter. 

Adopted daughter, yes. And her children were very helpful to me. I couldn't have done this, because this is very much a human drama. I couldn't have done it -- 

And a human tragedy. 

Yes, of the cost of total belief and of sort of abdicating reason. And, you know, I thought that the comparison would be made to ISIS, the recruitment of vulnerable young people to ISIS. But then along came all this news of Moscow again manipulating our affairs. One of the cast of characters in "True Believer" is Alger Hiss who was a very close friend of Noel Field's, and in fact, tried to recruit him into Soviet military. By that time, Noel Field was already working for KGB, the political. But there is not a shadow of a doubt after you read this book, that Alger Hiss was a spy. And a pretty good one too. 

Because of the effort to recruit. 

And other things. And my father had the same interrogator in prison as Noel Field and it was through this interrogator that my father learned a great deal about Alger Hiss. And I also found letters in the secret police archives where I worked, in both Moscow and Budapest, letters between Hiss and Field that made it absolutely crystal clear that Alger Hiss was indeed a spy. 

How long did it take you to write this? 

I average, this is, as you said, my ninth book, and I average three and a half to four years. This was four years and a lot of time spent in archives. But call me strange -- no, don't call me strange -- I enjoy archival work because a lot of it is -- yes, it is tedious, but then you find something that others have missed and it's very rewarding. 

A writer's joy. 

It is, it is. And this is a story that really has been missed by other Cold War historians and that I was very fortunate to have a family connection to. 

Congratulations. 

Thank you, Charlie. Thank you so much for talking to me. 

Great to have you here. 

Thank you. 

Thank you for joining us. See you next time.
