We begin this evening with more questions about the Russian hacking of the political process, and also about accusations against the Obama administration from President Trump. Calls are mounting for the Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. Chairman Nunes admitted yesterday that he met with a source on White House grounds last week to view secret intelligence reports. Those reports, he says, suggested potential surveillance of President Trump or his associates by U.S. spy agencies. Chairman Nunes has canceled all hearings scheduled for this week, including testimony from former acting attorney general, Sally Yates. Joining me now from Washington is Karoun Demirjian. She covers national security and politics for "The Washington Post." I am pleased to have her back on this program. Welcome. 

Good to be back. 

Tell me where you think this is with respect to the House Intelligence Committee and Chairman Nunes. 

Things are in a little bit of a disarray right now, I mean, you do have Democrats calling for him to step aside when it comes to this investigation that is front and center, and he's saying I won't go. And he's accusing them of just trying to take a political point and a shot right now. That does not bode well for actually progressing with this investigation, as we've seen. There was supposed to be an open hearing that was supposed to happen today with the former director of national intelligence, the former CIA director, and the former acting attorney general who is also a person that Trump fired because she refused to uphold immigration order, the first one. That got canceled late last week. Nunes said that was to make room for the FBI director and the NSA director to come back to Capitol Hill and talk to committee members behind closed doors. But then that hearing was never scheduled either. So, it's a pause. And I think people are not quite sure how long that pause is going to last. 

What's happened to the credibility of the committee? 

It's taken a hit in other parts of the Congress, for certain, you've seen, you know, most Republicans in the Senate do not want to say anything one way or the other about this. They don't want to comment. But you heard John McCain earlier and repeatedly say that it looks like things are time -- that it is time to actually put this to either a select committee or an independent commission because Congress has kind of shown that it can't do its job by itself anymore. You still have quite a lot of faith in the Senate Intelligence Committee process being run by Richard Burr and Mark Warner. And in the FBI process as well, although there are criticisms of the FBI director as well and how forthcoming he's being with information, although most people were pleased with his showing, in the open hearing last Monday that the House Intelligence Committee held to grill him and the NSA director about these issues. But, yeah, everybody is kind of -- clearly, there is a lot of discord in the House among members of the intelligence committee and leaders and everybody else surrounding that. Clearly, there is a lot of looking askance across the Capitol coming from senators. And, you know, the intelligence community is tight-lipped, but they are not rushing back to Capitol Hill to huddle behind closed doors of the intel committee. So, it's not clear exactly when that's gonna happen and when that will proceed. 

Tell us what actually -- what did Chairman Nunes actually do when he went to the White House? 

Well, we only know what, thus far really, what he's said, which is that he went to the White House grounds, we believe it's the executive office building, to meet with this source whose identify he won't disclose, to review this information which he said almost a week ago, and now suggested that there either was the president's name or his surrogates on his campaign team, excuse me, his transition team, rather, that their identities had been unmasked which is basically what happens when you have an intelligence report about surveillance that is being done and in this case, the surveillance was being done against foreign targets, not against Trump or his surrogates themselves. That's what's called incidental collection when you're at the wrong end of the phone line. So, basically, that is supposed to -- if you're a private U.S. citizen, your identity is supposed to be kept secret, just referred to as U.S. person number one or two, or what have you, in those reports. Nunes suggested that they may have been unmasked, that the identities actually may have been revealed. Even the day that he made that accusation, there was a lot of back and forth about that because his ranking member on the committee, Adam Schiff, said after he talked to Nunes much later that afternoon, that it was his impression that there was only one name that was unmasked in those intelligence reports and that it wasn't even a name of anyone affiliated with Trump or his operation. So, and Nunes has said, well, it was clear to me who those people were. So, we don't know right now if we are talking about, you know, picked up transcripts of phone calls between members of the Trump team and foreign agents. We don't know if we are talking about two foreign dignitaries maybe whose conversation was picked up, and they were talking about someone on the Trump team. We don't even know if we are just maybe talking about a cable that was sent and then picked up by surveillance and happened to mention the president or one of his surrogates in the aftermath of the election, this happened between November and January, Nunes said that much. So we don't know exactly what we are dealing with. We don't know quite how serious it is. And we don't really know specifically whether -- who, and whether those names were actually revealed. So lots of swirling questions and lots of swirling political anger happening in the wake of Nunes making this announcement and many Democrats are saying he's trying to distract from the fact that, you know, last week's hearing with the FBI and NSA directors did not go that well and trying to make sure that no other public hearings that could potentially be complicating for the administration take place because remember, that's the hearing in which we heard that the FBI has been looking into these allegations of possible ties between the Trump team and the Kremlin since July, which is significant and longer term than people realized previously. 

And more than ties, collusion has been suggested. 

Yes, the ranking member has certainly suggested, he said that there is circumstantial evidence of collusion and then he corrected himself later in the week to say there is more than circumstantial evidence of collusion, but he has not indicated yet what that is. If Democrats have identified a smoking gun, they have not publicized it, and it appears they haven't identified a smoking gun yet to substantiate that direct link between the president and Russian officials that would be untoward, I guess is the polite way to put it. 

Yes, right. 

I think some people are saying maybe even illegal, but these are all still allegations because we have not seen that link have been drawn. 

Has the chairman shared this information that he has and the information that he received on the White House grounds or at the executive office building, wherever he looked at it, has he shared it with Adam Schiff yet? 

The Democrats on the committee including the ranking members say they only know as much as we know at this point. 

"We" being the press? 

Yes, and they're pointing basically that the order of operations that happened that day that everybody found out, that Nunes went to the press twice before he came to the committee and that he's not been that forthcoming with details. And they say that they haven't even been given reasons why these hearings were canceled, much less specifics about what the source -- what Nunes' source is or exactly what he handed over. And even Nunes keeps saying that people will find out, the rest of the committee will find out as soon as he gets the full data drop or information drop rather of documents he requested from the FBI, the NSA, and the CIA outlining all of these. They asked -- he and Schiff asked for a full list of people whose identities were "unmasked" as part of the incidental collection sort of ventures when you have, as I described before, that surveillance is not necessarily directed at the individual but at somebody else and they just happen to be incidentally collected because they're referred to or on the opposite end of the phone line. That's stuff that everyone's still waiting on. So Nunes has said, well, he thinks that once that comes to Congress, that all of this will be cleared up and that everybody can see what he has seen. But the most recent update that he's given is that he's expecting the NSA's contribution of those documents to come maybe today or tomorrow. And we don't know yet when the CIA or FBI may furnish whatever is on their end. Each of these agencies has the power to unmask these identities legally. There are procedures to which you can do that when it is important and vital for the intelligence value of that collected information to know who it is they're talking about. There are legal procedures to do this. We actually don't even know yet if this was done legally or not legally. That also hasn't been clarified. So, it could turn out that this is a very, very concerning thing, that identities are being unmasked and leaked. And certainly there is this spectre of maybe that's the case or it could turn out that this is just a very commonplace ordinary thing that the intelligence community does and they were doing their jobs. And we're gonna have to wait for those documents. Again, we don't even know when those are coming to find out. 

And Sally Yates, what could she tell the committee? 

Well, Sally Yates was the acting attorney general under Trump and she, you know, bridges the gap from the previous administration to the current one. They're, you know, going back when we saw reports about, you know, who was meeting with various Russian officials. It appears that some of that information came from the Justice Department whether or not it was Yates herself. And those were the earlier chapters of this that we've probably almost forgotten about now. We are talking about the former national security advisor and the attorney general and the meetings that they had with the Russian ambassador. And the issue there being how forthcoming and open they were about the substance of those meetings more so than the fact they met with an ambassador. That's a fairly commonplace thing when you are open about it and they were not in this case. So I think a lot of people are very curious to hear what Yates does know, and are assuming that she might be more open to talking about it. As we reported earlier today, the White House went to lengths to try to keep Yates from testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee as she was originally scheduled to do today and clearly that didn't happen. It's supposed to happen at some point in the future but not until Comey and Rogers come back behind closed doors. But it does seem that they were trying to keep her from testifying and also that according to letters that we published that they were alleging that some of the communications would have been privileged because they happened with the president and they're pushing back against that. So, there's a question of whether there is something that she knows, that the White House knows that she knows, that they don't want to be publicly released, or if that is just a procedural thing that, you know, the presidential administration always like to play things closer to the chest especially because there is some discord between Trump and this particular acting attorney general, you know, they parted with a firing. 

Yes. 

It's potentially not the most healthy relationship, although I don't know that firsthand one way or the other. 

Didn't she go to the White House after the discovery of Flynn having met with the people that he met with to advise the White House of that? 

Yes. We've reported that as well. That's been -- again, this has become a common theme. There are various things we have reported in places like The Washington Post" or "The New York Times. The administration denies those reports that members of Congress, especially Republican members of Congress, will question the validity of those reports. There was quite a lot of back and forth with the FBI director last week where they seemed to be just sharing kind of insider wink-wink knowledge that, you know, oh, so often reports like this are wrong. Certainly, there's been quite a lot of effort to discredit -- I can't go into details because they didn't go into details about exactly which points, right? But I'm certain that, you know, a part of -- many of those things that we have reported and others have reported about what Yates' involvement was, the relationship that she had with the Trump administration, the degree to which there was pushback or she did alert them or the discussions they had, I'm sure those will come up in questions, and will if she appears before the committee. But they may come with questions from both sides, not only to find information there that could troublesome for the president, but potentially also to push back and discredit what has been reported thus far. In open forum, it would be up to Yates to set the record straight and it's not clear when or if that will happen at this point. 

There are a lot of questions out there. What is the most important question you would like an answer to? (LAUGHTER) 

I think all of us would like to know the ultimate question for all this, which is, is there any "there" there? Is there a smoking gun? Is there something that will substantiate all of these allegations? Or is this all, you know, as -- as many Democrats have said that they don't believe, they've asked, is this coincidence or is this something real? And certainly Republicans have said this is coincidence and just average things that everybody is pulling together into some great big conspiracy theory. But I think the question is to find out really what did take place, how high up it went, how much was behind it in terms of politics, maybe in terms of money, in terms of all of these allegations that have been thrown out there. 

Will Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner testify in open hearings before the committee? 

If they do it, it is not the first step. At this point, we only know that Manafort and Paige and Stone, and I believe as far as the Senate goes at least, Kushner as well, have offered to do these interviews which are not under oath. And also they are behind closed doors. So if that is step one, and then eventually there is step two for a public hearing, great, but we are not at that point yet. 

Thank you for coming. It's great to have you. 

Thank you. 

As always. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Ariel Levy is here. She has been a staff writer at "The New Yorker" magazine since 2008. She was 38 years old and five months pregnant in 2012 when she traveled to Mongolia to report on that country's mining boon. On her second night there, she suffered a miscarriage in her hotel room. She told the story of that experience and the events that followed in an essay for "The New Yorker" in 2013. Now, she has written a memoir. It is called "The Rules Do Not Apply." I am pleased to have her at this table. Welcome. 

Thanks for having me. 

We have lots to talk about here. (LAUGHTER) First of all, you won a National Magazine Award for the piece. 

Yes. 

This book is, and that piece was, an exploration of meaning, is that a fair statement?. 

Yes, yes. I mean, I think that particularly with the piece, I wanted to talk about the kind of experience of being a female human animal. 

Yes. 

I think it's sort of the last taboo. There is no more taboos around women's sexuality. But the fact that women are actually animals and that really intense stuff happens to us around birth, menstruation, fertility, all the things in that sphere of our being in our bodies, I wanted to get into that. 

Yes. I mean, take me back even earlier than that, to the light that you had. I mean, when you went to Mongolia, pregnant? 

Yes. 

Happy? Yes? 

I was very excited I was having a baby, yes. 

For the baby? 

Yes. 

And you have this wonderful line and it says that for a small amount of time, you knew you were a mother. 

Yes. Well, I knew because I had a living baby in my hands. So, I -- for ten minutes, I was somebody's mother. And that was black magic. That was something. 

That's the word you used, "black magic." 

Yes. 

What do you mean? 

Well, I mean because then he died. 

Right. 

So it was the most painful experience of my life but it was also the most transcendent because before he died, he lived, and I experienced motherhood very briefly, and I experienced what maternal love feels like which is the most brutal. 

In that short time, you felt it all. 

Yes. I mean, I'm sure had he lived to be four is how old he'd be now, I'm sure I'd feel all sorts of other things that I didn't get a chance to feel. But I experienced that love, that primal, brutal maternal love where you think, oh, I would die for you without -- it's not even a thought. 

Wow. And you wanted to take a picture of him. 

I did, yes. I took a picture. 

Because? 

Because the whole thing was so shocking. I mean, it was so surreal to be in Mongolia and to have a living person who came out of my body. That had never happened to me before. And I knew he was going to die. And this was going to be it. This was going to be the only time that we had together. And I knew I'd want to see his face again. And believe me, I looked at it a lot. 

And every time you look at it, you have the same emotion that you just described. 

It's different now. I don't look at it so much anymore, but when I first got back, yes. 

When you got back then, what kind of condition were you in? 

Not the best. I mean, I was so sad, I could barely breathe. And I had a little identity crisis on my hands because a switch had flipped in my heart and I felt like I was a mother, and a switch had flipped in my body and I was making milk, I was lactating for a baby who wasn't there. So, in the deepest part of myself, I felt like I was a mother, but that was invisible to the rest of the world because I had no child. So, I was in a pretty profound state of grief. 

Did writing about it -- I don't want to use the word cathartic, but something. 

Yes, definitely something. I don't know -- I mean, I've only ever experienced that set of circumstances and then written about it. I don't know what the grieving process would have been like had I not written about it. But then again, I also don't know what it's like to not write about everything that happens because that's what I've always done. 

Let me talk about your life. I mean, your parents sound fascinating. 

Yes. I dig them. 

You dig them. Children of the '60s. 

Yes. 

Tell me about them. 

Well, they're both feminists. My mom really stressed my whole life that I could do and be whatever I wanted and she had a lot of faith -- she always said of course you'll be a writer. And I think that was a huge gift to give to a kid who wanted to be a writer. To say, like, of course, that is what's going to happen. And my dad is a writer too. My dad has written for like, any -- if you name any kind of lefty-group, like Greenpeace, or NARAL, or NOW, any -- name it, he's probably written some of their copy. 

There's a moment in which you describe him and say he wants you to be proud of the fact that he approved. 

Oh, of my first girlfriend. 

Your first girlfriend. 

Yes, he said aren't you impressed that I'm so cool with this? And I said, not really, like. 

Yes, I mean, why wouldn't you be? 

Right. It's only in keeping with everything about you, right, so, yes. 

But they gave you confidence and they gave you... 

Well, they were very loving and they -- my mom really believed that I could write, like she really -- she really always told me that's what's going to happen. So, I believed her, you know. 

Why do you think someone can write as good as you can? 

Oh, what a nice thing to say. 

That's true. I mean, you can read this. Everybody who knows, who's read this. 

Well, it's all I do, I mean, it's what I've been doing for 20 years. All I ever do is write things. 

Yes. 

So. 

Is it natural, do you think? Is it learned? Is it what? 

I taught a writing class at Wesleyan where I attended college. And I taught that class like a year ago. And I thought it was sort of like either someone can write or they can't. Like it was a joy to interact with these students, but, yes, I think some people have it. Like it's just what they do. That is just how they exist. 

You also came back and were divorced. 

Yes. Two weeks after I got back from Mongolia, my former spouse went to rehab, and -- 

For alcoholism? 

For alcohol abuse, yes. And it was not the first. It was not the beginning of the problems around that. And at that moment in time, I just felt like I just couldn't do it. I just felt like I couldn't do two recoveries at once and I needed to do my own. 

But you sent this to her. 

Oh, yes. Oh, I love her. She's very important to me. I sent her this to read before I turned it into my editor, Kate
