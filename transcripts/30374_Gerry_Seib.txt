We begin this evening with our focus on President Trump's first 100 days in office. Earlier today "The Wall Street Journal" sat down with the president at the White House for a wide-ranging interview. The president said that he will not label China a currency manipulator, a reversal from the campaign. He also left open the possibility of keeping Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Fed despite previously saying that he would likely replace her at the end of her term next year. They covered many subjects. We want to talk about all of that with Gerry Seib. So tell me what the headline is, Gerry. 

Well, I think the headline probably is about North Korea, Charlie. A lot of the conversation was about the relationship with China and the relationship between the relationship with China and the North Korean nuclear threat. You know, a lot of conversation about the relationship he's developing with President Xi of China and how he's trying to use that relationship -- quite openly use that relationship -- to go after the North Korean nuclear program. In fact, he said essentially he's kind of offered a grand deal to the Chinese, to President Xi personally which is to say, he said look, if you help us resolve this North Korean nuclear program problem, help us stop the program, you'll get a better deal from us, the Trump administration, on trade, which is an issue that obviously was the centerpiece of the conversation about China in the campaign. So, it was a pretty direct message to the Chinese which he's already delivered himself. He said you know, you help us on North Korea, we'll do a better job for you on trade than we might otherwise. 

How many people were there? It was you, Jerry Baker, Carol Lee, Paul Beckett, and Michael Bender. 

Right, exactly. 

It took place in the Oval Office. 

Yes, yes. 

When did you know -- when was it scheduled? 

A couple of days ago, you know, we've been talking about it for awhile. You know, these things, you're never quite sure they're going to happen until they happen but it was put on the schedule a couple of days ago. So, it was in the context of sort of the flow of events around the visit to President Xi down in Florida and the Chinese missile strike and the fact that there, you know, there are some upcoming conversations about trade and the budget and the health care bill. You know, one of the problems is there is so much going on right now it's kind of hard to know how to focus any conversation because you know, the fire hose has been turned on and it's flowing freely right now. 

There was an interview with Fox News earlier -- I think yesterday or this morning, they ran it this morning -- in which he said that his next big effort is health care not tax reform. The tax reform follows health care. 

That was pretty clear in our conversation too. In fact, that was one of the striking things on the domestic side, which is we tried to get him engaged on tax reform. Where are you going to go on tax reform? There's a giant issue out there, rewriting the tax code is a big, big issue. Cutting taxes is a very important priority for Republicans, but every time we tried to go down the tax reform path, he averted to health care. He said we're going to do health care. We're back on health care essentially. We're going to get the health care bill done. We're going to kill Obamacare. We're going to replace Obamacare. You know, that all seemed to die away a couple of weeks ago when the House couldn't muster the votes to get it passed. And a lot of people thought and in fact the president himself suggested, we're going to set health care aside and move on, do taxes, do a big bill to spend more money on infrastructure. But that's not the case now. Now the message is we're being back to health care. We're going to get this done. We have to get this done first and we're close to making a deal. And he said, you know, this can happen one of two ways. I can work out an arrangement with the Republican conservatives who didn't like the approach we took before and I'm close to doing that or Democrats can come to me when we squeeze Obamacare and it starts to really wither on the vine and say let's make a deal with us and you and some Republicans. So, one way or the other, he said, we're going to get health care done, and I thought that was a striking change from, as I said, a week or two ago. 

He seems to be changing on a number of issues since the campaign. 

Yes, and I think on foreign policy you are seeing a quite different approach on a number of issues. Maybe, you know, and one of the things I wrote about after the meeting was the extent to which he's developing a good working relationship, even a close one, I'd say, with President Xi of China. China was the subject of a lot of very tough campaign rhetoric you'll remember, I mean, on trade, on bullying its neighbors, on cheating the U.S., on not playing fair. And it was Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who was supposed to be the one who was going to be the pal, the presidential pal, the one with whom there would be a close working relationship. Well, the reverse has actually happened. He is developing a very good relationship with President Xi, which he talked about at some length. They met for hours and hours down in Florida at Mar-a-Lago last week. They talked for an hour on the phone this week on Tuesday night and he said basically, I like this guy. We have a good chemistry. We can work together. When we asked about Vladimir Putin, he said well, I got a nice call from him after the election. I called him after the terrorist attack recently in Russia to offer our condolences and our help, but I don't really know Putin. So, you have on many fronts, including this one, a quite different reality than the one that was presaged during the election campaign. 

And we know that Secretary of State met with Putin today in Moscow and coming out of the meeting were not very positive notes about the future of U.S.-Russia relations. 

Yes, there is tension. There's a lot of tension there. And, you know, Syria has brought all those tensions to the surface. You know, the idea that the U.S. was going to work with Russia in Syria, not against Russia in Syria, now seems a pretty distant memory already. I mean, there is still a common goal -- let's eliminate ISIS, but a clear desire on the part of the U.S. now to get rid of President Assad in Syria and President Trump told us today that I'm not demanding that, but I think it's going to happen eventually. And as the Secretary of State has said essentially, he's invalidated himself as the future leader of Syria. Meanwhile the Russians continue to prop up President Assad. And so there is certainly tension there. And it came, it really came to the surface this week when U.S. officials said essentially we think the Russians knew about the chemical weapons attack that happened recently in Syria. We think they may have condoned it and we certainly think they're trying to cover up the evidence. Now, we asked President Trump about that and he said, we're not sure yet. We're investigating whether all those signs of Russian complicity are correct or not so he was cautious, but there is a lot of tension in the air. 

He was also cautious in terms of saying that Assad did not necessarily have to go. 

Right. And I think that's a way of saying that's not the goal of our policy, but if our policy produces a departure from Assad, we'd like that. And more than that, and I think this was the real message and this is the one you're sort of seeing play out at the United Nations. The world is going to decide that Assad can't stay. We don't, as the United States, have to make that decision and make that happen. And by the way President Trump was very clear and said a couple of times, we're not going to get into the quicksand of Syria. So, the missile strike is not a prelude to some big deep involvement of boots on the ground in Syria by any means. But I think the message is the world is going to get rid of Assad, we won't have to do that ultimately. 

But he did say, I mean, having looked at the transcript, he did say that they would in fact launch another -- the president would order the launch of another missile strike if in fact there was another use of sarin gas, or B, even perhaps because of barrel bombs. 

Yes, exactly. He did say that. He said, we've already sent that message. If there's another chemical attack, we'll act. Then the question we posed was, well, what about something short of a kind of a sarin gas attack, what about barrel bombs? And he said, well, we'll see. Maybe, you know. And he said it's a hard line to draw. But in terms of basically striking out at Syria for specific actions, that game is on to some extent and I think the message to the Syrians is, you know, watch it. We don't want you to know for sure when we're going to strike back, but we're willing to do it. 

What's interesting is that the Russians and the Iranians have said that they will meet force with force. I mean, does he have a sense that this is becoming precarious if in fact there's another strike and that the Russians somehow respond or the Iranians respond against American forces somewhere? 

Well, we didn't discuss it at that level of specificity, but I think the message was sort of, we'll be proportional. If we see misbehavior we'll respond accordingly, not, we're going to basically force the hands of the Syrians or the Russians or the Iranians, as far as that goes. And I think what he's trying to do -- what the president is trying to do here is walk a pretty fine line, or at least this is my impression, a pretty fine line between washing your hands of the problems in Syria on the one hand, or of getting deeply involved and deciding, well, we're not going to have to fix this thing, you know. This exactly the line that President Obama saw out there and it's the one he tried to avoid having to walk because it's very hard as a super power to get engaged a little bit. Once you get engaged, you're expected to stay engaged and ultimately to fix the problem. But, that's not the message from the Trump administration right now and we'll just have to see if he can be -- if you can be a little involved in Syria but not all the way in. 

Well the message from the Secretary of State is that our goal is to get rid of ISIS. 

Right. But then the Secretary of State Tillerson also said, after that, then we'll figure out how to solve the Syrian problem. So, I mean, he is acknowledging that there is a Syria problem out there that you can't avoid forever. But he's also saying sequence it. We're going to deal with ISIS first and then we're going to worry about President Assad and what happens to him. That's not at all inconsistent with what President Trump told us today. It's just that he was more explicit in saying we're not going to go diving into Syria. I said in the campaign that was a mistake. I'm still saying that's a mistake. That's not what we're about right now. 

How does he expect to get the Russians to negotiate? 

That's not clear. I think that, you know, I think there is -- one of the things that was hanging in the backdrop of our conversation was the meeting that was going on at the time we were talking, between Secretary of State Tillerson, Foreign Minister Lavrov, and the conversation with President Putin. So, what the results of those conversations were was not exactly clear in our conversation. And I think he was holding back a little bit to see, you know, what comes of that. You know, there is a question out there, when does president Trump meet with his Russian counterpart, with Vladimir Putin. You know, that may happen sooner than later because this question that you just raised, is in fact going to have to get hashed out. 

But I guess the chance to meet would be at the G-something meeting in Italy. 

Yes, that's a possibility but, you know, the Russians have made noises about wanting to do something directly one-on-one maybe sooner than that. But at a minimum, that's probably where they are going to have to sit down and look each other in the eye and say, what are we going to do? What's your plan and what's my plan? 

What's interesting about this is I mean, clearly, if you look at it on the face based on events that happened in the last two weeks, he almost in a Kissinger-style he's basically played the China hand as we believe between China and Russia, that China is the better place for us to do business. 

That's an interesting way to put it and I think that's, I think that's right. The superpower relationship that we're going to have to invest our time and our effort in and the one that we really need to make work, maybe it's the one with China. I mean, that's kind of the impression you got and by the way, I'm very happy to discover that President Xi is somebody I can work with. He's a serious guy. President Trump said he's a real leader, you know, I get along with him. There was a lot of indication in the body language as well as the actual words that, you know, we're going to work this China account, it's not going to be a disaster. We're going to make it -- we're going to be tough. We're going to be tough on trade. But we're going to make this relationship work. The one thing that didn't come up and that I still think looms in the background there is the way that China is asserting itself, or some would say bullying its neighbors in its own backyard, in the South China Sea. There is a lot of tension in that area and some of that tension involves close calls between the Russian navy and the U.S. navy as the Russians try to assert their rights to water and islands in that part of the world. So, there are places where this relationship could still go seriously off the tracks. But for now, you do get the feeling that the impression that Donald Trump has is that I can make this relationship work. 

He did talk about Chinese currency, didn't he? 

He did and he said explicitly, contrary to what he said in the campaign, that he's not going to declare -- the U.S. government is not going to officially declare that China is manipulating its currency to increase its power in trade, to increase its ability to export and make it harder for people to send their products to China. That by the way is a decision the government, the U.S. government has to make in a few days. And they've already made the decision. This was one of the news elements out of the meeting that they're not going to declare China a currency manipulator. Why? Well, I mean, the Chinese aren't manipulating their currency. They're not trying to drive down the value of their currency to gain trade advantages. In fact, the opposite has happened. The currency is appreciating and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, who joined us for this part of the conversation, said the Chinese are actually intervening to drive up the value of their currency. And of course the Trump administration wants to take credit for that and say they're doing this because we warned them they better change their behavior. The fact is, that's kind of been the way the Chinese have been heading for awhile. But in any case, that is one potential area of conflict and tension with the Chinese. That's not going to be an area of conflict. 

Did he at all talk about Janet Yellen and the fact that he's opposed to the idea of raising interest rates. 

He did and said, you know, basically I like low interest rates, which is a bit of a warning shot to Janet Yellen and the Fed not to not go too far and certainly not to go too fast in raising interest rates. But, you know, there is a question down the road and this is a ways off, another year plus of having to re-appoint Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Fed or not and he wouldn't engage on that. He said that's a ways off. But he did essentially say what he thinks about Fed policy, which is interest rates lower are better than interest rates higher, and I'm reserving judgment on Janet Yellen. He also said along the way, Charlie that he thinks the dollar has appreciated too much. That makes it difficult for people to sell, American companies to sell their products abroad. They become too expensive. And he said he would like to see the dollar go down, which had the effect of shaking the markets a little bit because when presidents say those sorts of things, they are taken seriously in the financial markets. 

And then there is the questions that were twirling around the Trump presidency before Syria and before the Chinese president came to Mar-a-Lago. It is this -- Steve Bannon on the one hand, the palace intrigue, the factional fighting, did he speak to that? 

You know, a little bit. Not much. He said basically of Steve Bannon, he said, he's a smart guy, I like him. He didn't join my campaign until late and I am my own strategist. I make my own decisions. I make my own decisions on strategy which was a kind of a difficult formulation to read precisely. You know, we asked him explicitly, are you going to make some changes in your senior team and he said, I don't think so but that's what I think for now. We'll see down the road, which is a classic Trumpian formulation, if you think about it. Like this is -- for now, no, but don't hold me to that later. 

But basically what he also -- he also said, you guys fix this or I'll fix it. 

Well, I think that's really what -- but probably what he is saying implicitly in his public comments and I suspect that's what he said explicitly in his conversations with his own staff. But the message was that I'm not doing any big staff shakeups for now and I like Steve Bannon fine but let's not be confused. He's not the president, I'm the president. 

There is also, I mean, he's got -- with respect to health care, he's got to -- and some other things -- he's got to risk his base. 

Yes. 

And he's got to negotiate with his base which is, in part, the Freedom Caucus in the House. I mean, is he prepared to abandon them? 

Well, I think what he was suggesting was that we're going to bring the Freedom Caucus around. They like me, he said this quite explicitly. They like me. They want me to succeed. I want them to be happy so we're going to find a way to do it. You know, one of the things that happened in the health care debate that actually works to the president's advantage is that some of the things the Freedom Caucus -- some of the changes in Obamacare or some parts of Obamacare they were trying to eliminate turned out to actually be fairly popular with those blue collar populist voters who supported Donald Trump. And so he's got a little bit of leverage I think on the Freedom Caucus because as people understood some of the changes that were being considered in health care at the behest of the Freedom Caucus and the more conservative parts of the Republican caucus in the House, they realized those things weren't playing all that well with Trump voters who benefit from some of those programs. And so I think the president is basically saying I may be able to bring those people around, but he's also saying if that doesn't happen, I'm willing to go out and cut a deal with the Democrats and I think the implicit message there was if I cut a deal with the Democrats, you guys in the Freedom Caucus aren't going to like the outcome of that conversation so much. 

Two other issues, one North Korea. Where does he think North Korea is going? 

Well, you know, I asked him specifically what's the message you are sending by sending an aircraft carrier and its associated ships toward North Korea in recent days? And he said -- and I think this is striking -- he said, you cannot allow a country like that to have nuclear weapons. That's the message he wants people to get. Now, the North Koreans already have nuclear weapons, you know, they have nuclear devices that they've exploded. But I think his message was I'm sending this as a sign to the North Koreans, and probably to the Chinese as well, that this program is going to have to be stopped one way or the other. And in particular, the ability to develop missiles that can deliver nuclear warheads is going to have to be stopped. 

Finally this. You have interviewed him before. You have seen him in action before. You have been reading and writing about all the controversy about the first however many days it's been so far. What was his demeanor? 

I thought he was more relaxed than I expected, given everything that's been going on, given all the controversies, given the Syrian episode, given the fact that he has just been through this high-stakes episode with the Chinese. He seemed pretty relaxed about all of that, maybe surprisingly so. But you know, we asked him what's -- you've been in this job now 75-80 days, whatever it is, you know, how does it change you? What is your reaction? And he said, you know, I don't think I have changed but the gravity of the office really does, it does kind of present itself to you. You can't avoid the fact that every decision is a big decision. They're life-and-death decisions. And he said it's not just like closing a real estate deal where you win or somebody else wins. These are decisions that are life-and-death decisions and every one of them is a big decision. So it was kind of I thought an interesting look into this sobering reality of being president, which Donald Trump has figured out. 

You know, it's that and they say all presidents say look, there's no experience that will give you everything you need to handle this job. They all say that. 

And he said, you know, you have to have -- all the skills you have need to be brought to bear in this job. So I mean there is clearly some element of being president that is humbling to anybody, everybody who has ever walked into that office. And that certainly includes the current occupant, I think. 

Gerry, thank you so much for joining us. 

Sure, Charlie. 

We continue now with David Sanger of "The New York Times" who was in Moscow. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also in Moscow, where he met with Russian president Vladimir Putin late today at the Kremlin. That meeting came amid heightened tensions between the two nations. It was the first face to face meeting of the Russian leader with a top Trump administration official. Earlier this week the White House accused Putin's government of covering up Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's role in the chemical attack. Putin in turn charged the Trump administration with having
