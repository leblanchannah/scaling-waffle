Good evening. I'm Jeff Glor filling in for Charlie Rose who is away today. We begin with news out of the United Kingdom. In a surprising development, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May declared that said she would call an early general election on June 8th. The move reflects an apparent effort to give the prime minister more flexibility in pending negotiations to exit the European Union, or Brexit. It's also a sudden reversal for May's previous position that the country needed time to ensure stability with the issues it's facing. The House of Commons will vote on Wednesday whether to approve the election. Joining me in New York is John Micklethwait, he's editor-in-chief of Bloomberg; and from Washington, Ed Luce, he's chief U.S. columnist and commentator for the "Financial Times". Welcome to both of you. To the latest chapter in the soap opera that is Brexit. Ed, let me start with you quickly, how surprising is this? 

It is quite surprising. This is the best-kept secret in British politics. If it had been David Cameron or Tony Blair planning to call a snap election, it would have been leaked out. And they had so many friends, David Cameron had a chumocracy, that it would have been hard to keep a secret. Theresa May is a very different kind of character. Doesn't reveal her hand and has executed a complete surprise to almost everybody except a very small coterie around her. It's no surprise, in another sense, in that, she doesn't have her own mandate. She became Prime Minister having been a reluctant Remainer, but she did campaign for Remain. She was probably where most -- many British people were, which is in the E.U. with her head but out of it with her heart. So she was therefore not seen as one of the true Brexiteers who were out of the E.U. with their heads and hearts. And if she now gets her own big mandate, big majority on June 8th, and indeed increases the slim conservative majority, she can then claim her own authority to pursue Brexit negotiations her own way. And that gives her independent standing that she's hitherto lacked. So in that sense, it's not a surprise, but it was a brilliantly kept secret. 

Which is what I was going to say to John, fundamentally, which is why she's doing this. 

Yes, there's a strong element of self-interest in this. I know she will characteristically say this is on behalf of the country and the country needs to back some version of Brexit, but she's definitely doing it with that in mind. The interesting thing, as Ed points out, is that her starting point, she has slim Tory majority. The thing which is unclear is whether she ends up with a bigger Tory majority, which is what we all think will probably happen. But, yet again, we could all be wrong. But assuming that does happen, that should be good for her because it should give her more stability, give her the ability to get things through Parliament easier if she wants. But sometimes having large groups of people means your chances of keeping them all in order are much smaller because you can't appeal to the tribal loyalty. And the underlying problem with this is the Tories and Europe, where the Tories have the same sort of approach to Europe as maybe the Republican Party here does to abortionists. It's all about the internal politics, the Tory party. And what MP's, many MP's think their main danger is of being deselected by their local party rather than being beaten by the Labor party. 

But as you say, what we've expected might happen has not always happened, whether it's -- 

Even people as clever as Ed and me have got this completely wrong repeatedly. 

So if we talk about June and the opposite of what you mentioned might happen does happen, what position does that put -- does Theresa May put herself in? 

I think Theresa May basically is -- at the moment, she's in a position where she doesn't have much -- she has a tiny majority, she still keeps on with a tiny majority, and that would not look good. The main other problem she's trying to do is play with time a bit because what's happening in continental Europe -- who are the other side of the big negotiation about Brexit -- you have the French election, but the French election isn't just the presidential bit, you then got the parliamentary bit after that. You've got Merkel's election. You've got August, which, as we all know is not a period where there's much work done. So she has this period that she declared Brexit or started the process. But for the next few months nothing's been happening. So in a strange way she's going back, she hopes, to replenish her sort of political supplies. 

Ed, the conservatives do have a significant amount of support, as you know, in the polls today. Is there a sense that has continued to surge? 

That's not clear. I mean, there's one party in Britain, the Liberal Democrats and only one that unambiguously wants a second referendum to reverse Brexit, and that's what they will campaign on. And Tony Blair, who's of course a former labor prime minister has indicated today that he'll probably campaign with the liberal Democratic Party. As John mentioned, polls in Britain, although they show a 20 point conservative lead which is prohibitive and overwhelming, although they show that huge lead, polls have got British elections wrong quite a lot recently, not just Brexit where a narrow Remain victory was indicated by the polls, but much more egregiously, the last general election in Britain two years ago in which labor was shown as being neck and neck with the conservatives, and labor was absolutely obliterated on the day. So it's a very volatile picture. John mentioned France. You know, Jean-Luc Melanchon, the far left French leader who could be compared possibly to Jeremy Corbyn, the shambolic Labor party leader. Melanchon was nowhere three or four weeks ago. He was polling single digits. Now he surged up to strong double digits out of the blue and that's in the space of three or four weeks. We've got six weeks between now and the British general election, and lots can happen in this kind of volatile environment. So I wouldn't bank on that Theresa May massively increases her majority scenario, although I would bet on it. 

What she wants is she wants flexibility. She wants people to say, trust me, I'm the person who is going to oversee the Brexit thing. But at this precise moment, she wants, like any other candidate, to say as little as possible other than trust me, because if she starts making pledges, saying things like we will have -- Brexit will absolutely guarantee the following things and they don't appear, then she's setting up a massive headache for herself later. She's taken a calculated risk that the opposition is so useless that she can get that mandate through now. But if she gets pushed gradually into revealing more and she's going to have this very hardcore pro-Brexit group within her party saying we mustn't allow X. We shouldn't pay money to the European Union when they go. We shouldn't do these things. That gives her very little wiggle room. Because I think at some point, it's likely she's going to come back from Brussels with what is quite a bad deal for Britain or not, particularly brilliant one. But she'll probably have to say that's the best I can get and that's not going to be an easy sell. 

This is the hard exits. 

Yes. 

That we talked about, versus the soft, more accommodations from the E.U. It's worth mentioning, we are now what? As we stand now two months away or less from the snap election, we're now ten months removed from Brexit? 

Yes. 

The vote? 

And the ramifications are still going on. Only a few -- back in those Halcyon days, it looked like the Tories were looking very secure. Cameron was likely to get a referendum, likely to push forward. British politics has certainly become incredibly volatile. 

One word for it. And as you mention, the polls are volatile as well. I mean, if you're forecasting time-wise here, again, you're now ten months removed, if there is an expectation whether it's going to be hard or a soft exit here, how long is Britain looking at? 

Well, I think it's got to be two years to negotiate the actual divorce agreement. That's an E.U. law. That's the article 50 she triggered in March. But in terms of negotiating a substantial trade deal with Europe that includes all the thorny questions about freedom of movement of peoples, whether the European court of justice has a role. That could take many, many years, beyond even the next election. I mean, it's worth, you know, in terms of John's point that she wants to give away as little as possible in this campaign, she's refusing to debate Jeremy Corbyn. There won't be any TV debates as of now. She might be forced to change that position. But she doesn't want to open her mouth. You know, Corbyn is held in very low regard, she's held in reasonably high regard, best thing to do just avoid him. 

Do you think that can happen? 

Yes. I think she might well get away with the no debates, but imagine she gets dragged into a debate, imagine she only narrowly increases the majority and she has to guarantee things to her back benches about what she wouldn't say. There's a narrative building up in British politics which is particularly among the right-wing press and amongst various members of the conservative party, which says basically no deal on Brexit is better than a bad deal, and that sounds very convincing. But actually when you start picking at that, that means that Britain would immediately have to jump back to operating with world trade organization rules. You look at places, you have the Irish politicians here today, you know, they're making the point. The island of Ireland is divided in two, if we end up with a barrier between one half and the other, which is also the frontier between Britain and the European Union, that is going to be very difficult if there is no kind of free trade deal to cover how people go backwards and forwards across that. There is complication upon complication in this, and she's taking this gamble that she can come back stronger in a better position to be able to do these things. But like everything else it's a risk. 

Ed Luce and John Micklethwait, appreciate both of your time. 

Thank you. 

Pleasure.
