Good evening. I'm Alison Stewart filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with politics. President Trump delivered a highly anticipated address to a joint session of congress last night. He defended his administration's first five weeks in office, and vowed to reach across party lines to achieve legislative goals including rebuilding the nation's highways and roads. 

If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. (APPLAUSE) Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program, the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. (APPLAUSE) 

The tone and content of last night's speech marked a reversal from the dire landscape that the president articulated during his inaugural address in January. 

A new chapter -- (APPLAUSE) -- of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. 

The question for many is which President Trump should we expect moving forward? Joining me now from Washington is David Rennie, he is Washington bureau chief and Lexington columnist for "The Economist;" also in Washington is Ed O'Keefe, he's a congressional reporter for "The Washington Post;" and here with me in New York is Megan Murphy, she's editor in chief of "Bloomberg Business Week," the latest issue of the magazine profiles top Trump advisor Stephen Miller. Welcome to all of you. We have had 24 hours to digest this speech. So David, I want to throw to you first. Obviously, the president was physically speaking in front of Congress, but he was spiritually and sort of psychologically reaching out to his base. What did he say that made them happy, made them know they supported the right candidate? 

That's exactly the right question to ask. And I found myself watching the speech last night waiting to hear details finally filled in on how he's going to sort of fund that infrastructure he talks about, you know, what will be his tax plan? When those details didn't come, and I realized that I guess people like us who are trying to work out what Donald Trump's agenda is, are still disappointed. We don't know. I then was asking, how come his supporters who I meet out when I go to rallies and political meetings, how come they are so absolutely certain that he is keeping his promises and they're so happy that he is doing what he said he would do. And it occurred to me that what's really going on, I think, is that we in Washington, or you in New York, we're very focused on what politicians do. Donald Trump's genius is to be the guy who can tell you who he is doing it for. He's standing for his people. Last night he broadened the frame of it to being he's the guy who represents the champion for all American citizens who will put American citizens ahead of foreigners, ahead of illegal immigrants, ahead of kind of global rivals who are trying to do America down. He will tell you who he's for. We're still wanting to know what he's for. And I think that explains all the gap. 

Megan, let's talk about what wasn't covered in the speech last night. We didn't hear about climate change. We didn't hear about economic inequality. What was a glaring omission for you and why? 

We should give a quick shout-out to clean air and clean water. 

As we're talking about the EPA. 

I think we have to be honest, in that, this was a good moment for him. He had two objectives last night. He wanted to reset his image with the American people and he wanted to reset his image with his own party. He's got some incredibly difficult battles to fight ahead in terms of getting his legislative agenda ahead. And David is exactly right, while we don't know details, we do know getting forward a comprehensive tax reform plan, getting forward Affordable Care Act repeal and replace and what's going on with Obamacare is going to be very difficult. I think in terms of the omission, in terms of where he could have and should have done more, was number one on fleshing out the details of the things that could have been a very easy win for him and I think a bipartisan win. 

For example. 

One of those is infrastructure. You showed a little bit of a clip there. But when you look at this administration, you look at some of the missteps and mistakes they've had which has been immense. One of them is obviously the immigration order rollout and the refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. But, I think, when you look back and you look back at the early days of this Trump presidency, if he turns out to be a relatively unsuccessful president in getting his agenda sent forward, one would be he missed this opportunity to really put the screws on the wheels. Everyone is calling for infrastructure reform. He would have put his own party, in terms of a really true stimulus budget forward and put them in a difficult place to reject it, and really started on something that could have been a bipartisan move forward for him. I think that was a bit of -- again, not to press it harder last night. 

Ed, two weeks ago, you and I were sitting here discussing that 77 minute rollicking press conference. Now the speech we saw last night, it felt like to me that it was candidate Trump's stump speech put through an auto tune, right? You know, that's the program that record producers use to sort of smooth out the edges and get people back on pitch. Did you hear anything new and different? 

Well, I think his general approach and the fact that he was able to come into that room, command it, and deliver a state of the union like address proves that this is somebody who, at least to nervous Republicans, is capable of at least appearing presidential and delivering and laying out an agenda. The specifics be damned at this point. You know, I did hear a little more specificity, not much, but a little bit more about sort of where they want to go on Obamacare, where they want to go on tax reform. He did not get into discussion of immigration reform in ways that he has privately now twice in the last two weeks with senators and with news anchors talking about the idea of a broader immigration bill. And part of the reason we didn't hear more about infrastructure spending, frankly, is because the biggest most important audience he had to address there last night and to impress, I don't think was the American public. It was those hundreds of Republicans in the room who for the last several weeks with little guidance from the White House, have been squabbling amongst themselves about how exactly to do a new health-care system in this country, about how exactly to reform the tax system, how to pay for a border wall, and a host of other issues. And so the fact that he didn't get into the issues where he might be able to find some more bipartisan accord wasn't just because Democrats right now aren't in the mood to work with him and don't feel that he's done anything to win them over, but also because the next few months for him and for Republicans are probably going to be the most critical of the last four years because this is their one and only opportunity to prove that they can actually govern and make changes after years of threatening to do so if they ever had power. 

David, we did not hear about Aleppo. We didn't hear about Moscow. Why not? 

Foreign policy was kind of amazingly absent. We had some warmish words about NATO. We had, as you say, I think the auto tune analogy is pretty good. We had a hint of the sort of nationalist suspicion of international organizations where he talked about sovereign states. He talked about free nations being able to decide their own fate. It was interesting that when I checked the European press today for their reactions, one of the big French papers, "La Monde," picked up on that and said that sounded to them like an attack on the European Union. It's those kinds of things that make people very jumpy among America's allies. But I think in terms of Russia, it's one of the many areas where it's not just that Donald Trump has kind of controversies that he wants to wish away. I think one of the fascinating things about this 40 days of rollout is there's an open question, does Donald Trump actually enjoy the kind of hard grind of governing, the hard grind of detail, of tackling these complex subjects, or is that actually not his comfort zone? I think that's one of the unanswered questions, too. 

I think it's pretty clear that the hard grind of governing is not something that he feels is his strong suit. Basically, last night's address was pretty much a, here's what I want in terms of overarching promises and let's let the detail be worked out. Please come together in some type of magical way, and get forward some of these incredibly difficult agenda items. But I think David is exactly right there. What he's shown over these first few weeks is that is always going to be a little bit of a mountain with this administration in general. And they, frankly, don't have the organization and, so far, the internal discipline to push through these incredibly difficult challenges they have ahead like Obamacare, like tax reform, like getting anything done, needing still votes from the Senate from the Democratic side. 

Ed, one of the things that I've heard was Donald Trump is an interesting entity in to himself. He is not a traditional Republican. You heard the tepid applause about infrastructure and paid family leave. He's also, obviously, not a favor of the Democrats. So at this point, is his uniqueness, is it an issue for him or is it an issue for the congress going forward in terms of getting anything done? 

I don't think we know that yet. And I know in this day and age we want answers to this stuff and we want to see results quickly. But, you know, we really need to strap in for I think at least nine months of intense activity on the Hill trying to sort this stuff out. It's going to take a little while. We're not going to see a lot of movement on this very quickly. Simply because these things take time and as the president learned last week, you know, healthcare is a complicated thing. Well, yeah, it took more than a year for Democrats in the Obama administration to put this thing together. To try to cobble it together in a new way is going to take just as long most likely. And how do you do that while you also want to tackle tax reform and immigration and all this other stuff. We just don't know yet. And I think Megan and David are both correct in that we haven't seen much yet from Trump on whether or not he really is into the art of governing, and whether his administration is capable of it. Now that you have cabinet secretaries essentially in place across the different agencies that would be affected by these big changes, the question is how do they build out their teams and their policy and work with these committees in the next few months? But this is going to take a little time. We're not really going to be able to measure the success of him and where he fits into the two-party dynamic, I think, for a little while longer. I think we have to really put aside though talk of lofty immigration and infrastructure work and paid parent, you know, paid leave for taking care of children, or sick parents, because they have to get that other stuff done first and it's going to take a while. And whether they can hold together really does remain a big unknown. There was a meeting today at the White House between top Republican leaders and the president to talk about how they put together that healthcare plan. How they sell it not only to the country but to themselves. And then, how do they work on those tricky things like paying for the border wall and where exactly that border wall would go. Remember, much of the opposition to that on Capitol Hill isn't from Democrats, necessarily, it's from border state Republicans, and border district Republicans, congressional Republicans who represent that 2,000 miles of border. They're concerned about this. There's going to have to be modifications. And it's going to be really difficult for this president to sort it out. 

I just wanted to jump in, when you were talking about the fact that he sometimes stands a bit like a Democrat on things like paid family leave, or you know, some of his views on not wanting tackle and title and reform. One of the things that's very striking, and I've been covering American politics this time around for five years, but before that my posting was covering European politics. He doesn't sound that unusual or that unfamiliar in the European frame. That mix of lots of spending on law and order, on the military, on the border but preserving pensions for old people, preserving welfare for your old kind of white voters, that mix is basically the far right nationalist French mix. For example, what we're going to see in the French elections with someone like Marine Le Pen. His agenda, the whole spectrum of anti-immigrants, willing to spend lots of money on old people, but lots of money on law and order, that's basically the Front National in France, that's -- in the Netherlands, he's very much an economic blood and soil nationalist in the European style. 

In talking about the economics, I mean, I think that's also the one thing what that when we talk about will be maybe something that was another bit of own goal last night. I mean, David is exactly right and saying his agenda is very much straight out of Marine Le Pen. But when he talk about inheriting a mess of an economy, when you talk about a number, like 94 million people out of work, that number just isn't true. When he talks about sort of sets the standard for himself of boosting growth to say two percent under the Obama administration up to, you know, three percent, four percent, even some Republicans talk about five percent through stripping out regulation, through tax reform, et cetera. That is also something that people are going to look back over time, overlooking back at this administration and saying did you actually keep those promises to voters? So much of his agenda is built on this nationalist economic agenda of returning manufacturing, of creating more jobs, of bringing back a traditional American economic base that people think it is. So many of the issues we have economically are due to structural displacement, automation, an incredibly aging workforce, a workforce that works in different ways that has different kinds of shift jobs where women's labor force participation remains a huge challenge for us. And I think that there will be a view that he was much too blase about the challenges of taking us from say a two percent to a four percent growth. And his economic agenda is still so focused on top down. We saw Dow 21,000 today. And there's no question that Wall Street and the titans of industry viewed this speech very favorably. The irony is, those people who were most likely to back him, white working class voters from the rust belt from Michigan, from Ohio, from Wisconsin, those are people who are yet to benefit from that huge increase in the market, from these kinds of policies. And if he doesn't make good on that, that's going to be a big problem for him and a big problem for the Republican Party. 

Ed, the president talked about civilians and had guests in the audience. And one thing that struck me is out of the four people he talked to, two were African-Americans, talked about, the young woman who had the school choice, and the gentleman whose son was killed by an undocumented person in this country. Donald Trump only got eight percent of the African-American vote, what was that stagecraft about? 

It's about improving those numbers. You know, Republicans for years have worked at this, believing that, you know, it was Jeb Bush who used to say -- I covered his campaign -- he's say, you know, he quoted Ronald Reagan, that most Americans are conservative. They just don't realize it yet. This is a Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer obsession for when they ran the Republican national committee. And Trump himself is interested in doing it. He believes that if given a chance and people heard him out that he would win them over, we'll see. He has done nothing to help himself, frankly, among Hispanics, among Latinos in this country, given how he's talked about and what he has done regarding immigration in recent weeks. You notice he didn't invite any Latinos to sit up there in the balcony. Denisha Merriweather was the woman who was there as sort of the emblem of school choice, again, another person that Jeb Bush traveled with during his campaign. And she's really a symbol for many Republicans of the benefits and the success, the potential of school choice which is a big concern of the presidents, and something that he'll be talking about on Friday at a catholic school in Orlando. But, yes, they're definitely trying to broaden the appeal to do what he can, to win over African-Americans, and Latino voters, and union households, and to just find ways to continue to cut in to the Democratic diasporas. But as polling has borne-out in the early days of this presidency, he's not making much of a dent despite his attempts. 

That was a spending speech as they say in my house. How is all this going to get paid for? 

Well, that's the big question, isn't it? And with little flesh on the bones to actually get this detail. One thing that has been talked about and is constantly talked about is this border tax, adjustment tax, which is projected to raise one trillion. You're already seeing huge mobilization against it. This is the tax wall. The corporate tax rate would drop down to 20 percent, which is something they've been trying to do for years. You also would put basically a bigger levy on imports. You would encourage American manufactures to keep jobs, keep production at home, and you discourage them from importing goods from abroad. The problem is there's a huge section of the American economy, whether that's retailers, whether that's oil refineries that import these materials. And that would be, in particular in the retail sector, really deadly. They've already mobilized against it. They're already running ads against it. I mean, this is a cornerstone of the Paul Ryan tax plan to get this one trillion through to fund a lot of these initiatives. The problem is that it's already is looking a little bit dead on arrival. Donald Trump's own administration can't seem to agree, between Steve Bannon, between Gary Cohn from Goldman Sacs, and Steve Mnuchin who are ardently against it, versus Bannon's wing who seems to be for it. So, look, it is very difficult to come up with the money. You may look at his military spending, taking that up, again, that's hugely divisive within his own party, let alone the Democratic Party. His budget looks dead on arrival. So, look, it was a good night for him. It was a good speech given the very low expectations, frankly, that were out there. He jumped over the bar and he jumped over the bar quite cleanly. The tax of getting this agenda through, welcome to Washington, game on, but let's see whether or not he's actually gonna be able to forge any type of agreement within his own party, let alone getting some support he needs across the aisle to get this stuff through. 

Megan's identified -- 

Hey, Alison. 

Yes, go ahead. 

To Megan's point, it's going to be all about how to pay for these things. And that is why the next few months are going to be really tricky for Republicans. It's going to be a real test of his patience. And I think may further expose whether he is in some ways embracing conservative orthodoxy, especially on fiscal issues, or whether he is just like, no, screw it, let's just spend this money and the rest of you who are concerned about this be damned. If that happens, there's at least two, maybe three dozen house Republicans certainly who have said they're willing to stand up and start blocking things if they need to. 

David, last word here? 

I think another really interesting thing about Donald Trump which we learned during the campaign, I interviewed him a couple of times and this came up. He is a guy who does not like to admit that there might be painful tradeoffs. So I asked him about things like what it happens if prices go up in Walmart, at the time it wasn't about border adjustment, it was about if he slaps tariffs on Chinese imports. And I said to him, you know, a lot of your voters, they go to Walmart. What will they do when those prices go up? And he did not want to admit that there would be a tradeoff. So what he said to me at the time was, oh, you know, maybe my guys they go and buy three dolls for their daughter, maybe they'll just go and buy one doll for their daughter, but they'll have a great job, so everyone will be happy, no? And I think what that showed you that at least as a campaigner he liked to think that everything could be kind of resolved to everyone's satisfaction and that he would be able to avoid painful tradeoffs. Well, Washington is a town where tradeoffs are the kind of the air that we breathe. 

This is to be continued is what I'm hearing you all say. David Rennie from the Economist, Ed O'Keefe from the Washington Post, and Megan Murphy from Bloomberg Business Week, thanks, everybody. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
