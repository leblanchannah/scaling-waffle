It has been another chaotic and surprising week in Washington. Michael Flynn, President Trump's former National Security Advisor is now seeking immunity. And the Congressional Committee's probing Russia's influence on the elections are considering that. Meanwhile the president is at odds with congressional members of his own party, notably the conservatives of the House Freedom Caucus. Joining me from Washington, Dan Balz, the Chief Correspondent of "The Washington Post;" here in New York, Mike Allen, the co-founder of the news site Axios. I begin with Dan Balz. Dan, where are we at almost 70 days into the Trump presidency? 

Both the "Economist" and the "New Yorker," which will be out on Monday, have pictures or have covers of Donald Trump, one in a sand trap and the other having knocked out almost every window in the White House from the south lawn with his driver. I think that tell us a lot about the perceptions of where they are, which is that they've had, as we've said, almost from day one a chaotic start. They are still struggling to find their sea legs in the White House. They have yet to rack up one significant victory. The closest they've come is the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which looks like it's still on track to go through but hasn't quite yet, and they are having this cloud of the Russia investigation hang over them. And now as a result of things that have happened over the last ten days, many, many questions about exactly what White House officials have done as part of that investigation. 

I want to come back to that, but what's the problem? 

Well, I think the problem is -- it goes to the president himself. The president came into this office without any particular experience in either politics or government, and I think that it has shown up. I think that they have not developed a clear strategy. I think that, in many ways, the governing approach to what they're doing went off-track during the transition and they've never quite been able to get control of that. It's not clear what their strategy was supposed to be on health care. It's not clear what their next priority is. He has signed a lot of executive orders. He's begun to undo some things that occurred during President Obama's presidency, but those are not yet in place. And so, I think it's a White House that has multiple power centers, conflicting power centers, and a president who is seemingly easily distracted and, as we saw on the health care debate, not particularly at all a detail person and, therefore, was at a handicap in trying to make his persuasive case to the reluctant Freedom Caucus members and others. 

What would you add to that, Mike? 

Well, Charlie, agreeing a hundred percent. And this is the second terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad week in a row for the Trump White House. And I can tell you the Republicans are really worried about it, because as Dan points out, not only no wins but no prospects of wins. Charlie, they have not changed the math in any way that could guarantee them a win and, in fact, it's worse because, now, President Trump, by taking on the Freedom Caucus, the furthest right part of the Republican Party, he's unified them, and several people who have worked, the House Republicans, for a long time, said that he has taken a group that you can sort of split up five by five and put them essentially in control of the government, made them the swing group and, now, what everybody is worried about is a government shutdown. April 28th, funding runs out. April 29th, day 100 of the Trump presidency, we could have a government showdown, a Republican Congress failing to fund a Republican government. 

Is that likely? 

So I was told it was more likely than not, and that was based on the idea that the math hasn't changed. They just can't get the votes together. What they're going to have to do -- and this is going to be very unpleasant for the speaker, very unpleasant for the president, but they're going to have to do it with Democratic votes, which is just going to make Republicans even more unhappy with this White House, even less likely to come to the rescue on tax reform or something else that he needs and wants. 

Should the president have started with tax reform and not health care, Dan? 

Well, Charlie, I don't quite know that I can answer that correctly. I think that they had to start with Obamacare because it was the signature pledge, not only that Donald Trump used throughout the campaign, but that the Republican Party has used since the Affordable Care Act was passed. I think that they had had ample time and opportunity to put together a strategy to do that, and I think that it was in many ways, should have been the easiest approach, had they done their homework and had there been some coordination between the campaign and the Congress. But they didn't do that. Tax reform is -- you know, is by no stretch of the imagination any easier than trying to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Both are extraordinarily complex. So, you know, others have said maybe he should have started with an infrastructure package and been able to corral the Democrats into some kind of cooperative arrangement that would have spoken, in a sense, to his unique constituency and the appeal that he was able to project during the campaign. But I think that, you know, if you're a Republican president with a newly-empowered Republican Congress, you're pretty much obliged to start with something that's high on the list of the Republican Party's agenda. So I think that, for all those reasons, I think, inevitably, they had to start with Obamacare and, obviously, nobody thought that it would collapse before it even came to a vote in the House. 

But was it inevitable because they had to bring together so many warring factions, I mean, moderates, Freedom Caucus, and Democrats saying nothing will satisfy us? 

That was always going to be hard, and the president didn't realize until way too late how hard it was. Charlie, he feels ill-served by some of the people around him who are supposed to know House Republicans, and they had supreme confidence or at least projected supreme confidence that in the end he would be the closer and he would pull this off, so I think he was surprised and irritated and the staff now is embarrassed. We are told that at night, the president is consulting with a lot of the friends he's had 30, 40 years, some of his billionaire friends, asking what went wrong. We're told the president is brooding and that he is baffled by what's happened. Dan mentioned at the top, the competing and conflicting power centers, Charlie, as you know, as Dan knows from covering this, the Trump team has been very proud from the beginning that they ran their campaign, ran their convention, ran their transition, ran their White House, the way he ran his business and that is with these different centers of gravity, you know, empowering family members without transparency and with a very lean style. 

And an element of chaos always. 

Exactly, improvisation, and now they're paying the check for that. They're now in a place where you are accountable in the most public possible way and it's not working and the president hasn't exactly figured out why. 

Dan, turn to the Russians and what happened. Here Chairman Nunes goes to the White House. He now meets with two people, at least two that we know about. Explain to me what happened. (LAUGHTER) 

Charlie, it's so hard to explain. Every time we go through the sequencing, it becomes more mysterious. He went to the White House to view some sensitive intelligence, which he concluded showed that there had been some form of surveillance in which Trump officials had been caught up, incidentally, in that and in some form or another, identifiable or unmasked. He then sought a meeting with the president of the United States to brief him on that. At that time, or a day after, Sean Spicer was asked at the briefing, is it possible that the information that the chairman received came from the White House? And Sean Spicer said, that doesn't pass the smell test, why would he brief the president on something he got from us? Well, it now turns out that White House people were, in fact, involved in that and, so, in a sense, the question is even larger and more urgent, why was this done? As Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee said yesterday, why all the cloak and dagger stuff if this was information that the White House says was picked up through the normal course of business and, in some form or fashion, went up the line to people in the White House councils office, the way "The Times" and we reported today, why that then had to go to Chairman Nunes to go to the president. So nothing of this makes any particular sense other than there was an effort to try to, if not exonerate the president for the Tweet that said that President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower, that it was an attempt to, in one way or another, muddy all of that and to add to the diversion that's been created by the president's Tweets. 

When you look at this, do we expect that the Senate Intelligence Committee will be able to do an effective job, because there is evidence of respect between the Republican chairman and the Democratic minority leader? 

I think that that's right, but their findings are always going to be questioned because, as you and Dan point out, there's overlay. And like everything we've talked about from the beginning of this conversation, almost all of it is self-inflicted. So the other momentous development this week, Mike Flynn, the president's former National Security Advisor, asking for immunity from prosecution to tell his story. Now the reason this is a grave development is someone explained to me that, yes, a smart lawyer is going to ask for that, but separately, you asked for immunity because you think you have something to sell, you think you have a story to tell that prosecutors want, and that's such bad news for the Trump White House. Already, as you point out, people are worried because of this open FBI investigation. The FBI director in front of Congress not willing to say who might be in the crosshairs, which means everybody in the West Wing is. Charlie, you've covered these forever. You know the one rule about investigations -- FBI investigation is they never finish where they started. So creating so much worry and chaos. I talked to somebody who was in the West Wing, and they said you can see it in their faces. People red-faced, people exhausted, people running around with papers. In fact, they had a memorable description, Charlie, as you know, people always said about the TV show "West Wing" that it was a lot more chaotic and dramatic than the actual West Wing, which under President Bush 43 and President Obama was pretty stayed. Well, people who go there now tell me now the West Wing is like the TV. They said the president is almost like playing a president in real life. 

So the investigation will continue. Might we hear things from Sally Yates? 

Charlie, Mike's absolutely right that once an investigation starts on any of these kinds of issues, it goes in directions you can't anticipate, you know, it's peeling back the layers of the onion. And, certainly, Sally Yates will have some interesting testimony about General Flynn. And the other thing we just don't know is all the aspects of the various people that they've already identified who are going to come in to testify, many of whom have said they want to testify voluntarily, we don't know what those private interviews will be like and what those will reveal, and therefore, what will come out in public. Things will be known for weeks, if not months, before they become out in a public session. So, we're in for a very, very long -- a very, very long time before we really get anywhere close to answering most of these questions. The issue of immunity for General Flynn seems to, I think, everybody, to be way premature given where these investigations are. Neither the Senate nor the House Committee is going to provide him immunity at this stage of the investigation. There is just so much more they need to know. Obviously, I think the House investigation, the intelligence committee has been compromised by the partisanship that has gone back and forth and by what the chairman has done in recent weeks, there is hope that the Senate Committee can rise above that, but I think there're still people who believe that inevitably this could still lead to an independent commission, which again, would set it back months and months, but might retain more credibility than either the House or Senate Committee might be able to do. 

The president, as I said, on Masters weekend at Mar-a-Lago, is meeting with the president of China. I mean, China -- to have an effective relationship with China is essential, A, because the greatest national security threat right now, many people believe, is North Korea, both because of their leader and because of their potential with nuclear warheads. 

It's hugely important. And I think what's interesting is what's been the sort of table setting of this. We all remember that during the transition, President Trump seemed to signal a change in the One China policy. And then once he was in office and had a conversation with the president of China, he backed away from that and reaffirmed that the United States was not changing course on that. So that was seen as a victory for the Chinese that they got the president to back away from that. Sean Spicer was asked at the briefing today, the president had said during the campaign that on day one he was going to label China a currency manipulator. That hasn't happened. Why hasn't it happened? Spicer's response was, well, everything is kind of in abeyance until we have the meeting at Mar-a-Lago. So, I mean, the stakes are enormous, the issues are very, very important, and as Mike says, I think, these are both leaders who probably think that they have something they need to get out of it, and the question is whether they can do that in a constructive way or whether they will end up in a debilitating conversation that satisfies neither side. 

Well, there is this caveat, too. It is said that the Chinese president would not take after the One China policy remarks by President Trump, that the Chinese president would not take his call, and he tried to call him a number of times, and didn't take his call, and that sent a message as to -- 

That's right. And that's why President Xi thinks that he has the upper hand. He saw that engaging with President Trump, he was able to get something out of him. That's why he's going to Mar-a-Lago. The president of the United States, by having him on his own personal turf, thinks that he senses his own advantage. We saw in his Tweets this week that he's going to have a tough posture, but this president, again and again, he's a salesperson. When he's in-person, his inclination is to be the great host. So that's going to be fun to watch. 

Right. There was another story that intrigued me in "The Washington Post" today. It was about the Secretary of State. I mean, really an interesting piece, Dan, that suggested that, you know, he's spending most of his time alone, he takes his elevator, goes to his luxurious office on the sixth or seventh floor at the State Department and spends a lot of time primarily -- primarily -- with his closest advisors, I mean, rarely seeing some of the distinguished diplomats that are part of the State Department. 

It was a very interesting piece and I think a worrisome piece. I mean, Rex Tillerson came into this administration with a very good reputation as a chief executive. There were obviously questions about his relationship with Putin and the Russians, but, aside from that, he had sterling recommendations from the likes of Bob Gates and Condoleezza Rice and others. He has been a puzzle in his time in office. You know, he seems to have good access to the president and, presumably, they are building a relationship. He seems to have no relationships with the department that he is overseeing. Now, it's not entirely unusual for a Secretary of State to surround him or herself with some close aides. I mean, John Kerry did it, Hillary Clinton certainly did it, but there are also always links to the permanent bureaucracy and to senior diplomats and to the institution. That doesn't seem to be the case. I mean, the State Department is facing a 30 percent cut in its budget, in the new budget that the White House and OMB set up a few weeks ago. That is an enormous cut, and one that the Secretary of State, presumably, is trying to resist, but it is not clear that he is really doing that. So, you know, perhaps he is carefully and methodically preparing himself in ways we don't understand, so that when he is abroad, as he has been recently, he's ready to do what he needs to do. But there is a public side to being Secretary of State and, so far, he has done none of that, and I think that's what's raised all the questions about what his real stature is going to be, not just inside the administration but as, you know, the leading face of American diplomacy. 

Mike Allen, thank you so much. 

I thank you for the honor of being at your table. 

Dan Balz, great to see you. 

Charlie, thank you very much.
