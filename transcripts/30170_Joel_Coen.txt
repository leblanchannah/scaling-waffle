We'll be right back. Stay with us. ''Fargo'' Joel and ETHAN COEN are two of the most original of contemporary filmmakers. Since their debut in 1984, they have revitalized genres, film noire with Blood Simple, madcap comedy with Raising Arizona, and the gangster epic with Miller's Crossing. In 1991, their film Barton Fink won unprecedented Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actor awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Fargo is their latest work, a comedic thriller that film critic David Denby referred to as the dark side of A Prairie Home Companion. It stars FRANCES McDORMAND as the pregnant sheriff of a small town in Minnesota called upon to investigate a strange murder. She is here as well as the Coen brothers. And I am very pleased to have them here. Welcome. 

Thanks. 

Thanks. 

It's great to have all of you here. Here is my first question. This movie was not based on an actual crime. 

Who says? 

Was it? 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

It was. 

Yeah. 

And this story is completely based on a real event. 

Yeah, the story is. The characters-- you know, we, we weren't interested in making a documentary, and the characters are really inventions based on the sort of outline of events. 

Yeah. 

So we invented the characters and they're really sort of our creation and the creation of the actors who played the parts. 

So Steve Buscemi, and, and all the-- and Frances and all these terrific ensemble company that you put together here in a sense made their characters what they became. 

Yeah. Yeah. I mean-- 

More so than in the, in the, in the vision and the ear of a, a-- pen of a screenwriter. 

Well, I think it's probably the same sort of combination as in most of our scripts. We imagine the characters a certain way when we're writing them, and we often write for particular actors. I mean, we, we actually are intending to do more and more of that as we make more and more films. 

As we did in this movie or Frances' part and the part Steve Buscemi played and the part Peter Stormare played. 

Yeah. 

So it's, you know, it's a combination of our sort of imagining them a certain way and then when the actors come in, and they begin to really embody the parts when you start rehearsing. You know, we almost, I think, kind of let go of it at a certain point and it becomes the invention of the, of the actors who are playing it. 

Frances, we're going to get to you. Hang on. Tell me, what is it, in your eyes, that you-- make you guys original and different? I mean, when we say the Coen brothers, everybody knows exactly what kind of film we're talking about. We know, in a sense, that it's going to have a certain quality to it. What do you think it is, and what is it makes you different as filmmakers. 

Yeah. That's hard to-- I mean, we're probably the worst people to ask that. 

Probably. 

I mean, as far as we're concerned, what we're trying to do is do something different from what we've done before, so-- 

Each time out. 

Yeah. I mean, just for the sake of variety, just in the interest of keeping life interesting for ourselves. So to the extent that there's anything that the movies have in common, we're not aware of it. We sort of try to avoid it, in fact. 

Yeah. And it is always st-- it has been strange from the beginning to be sort of considered so aggressively idiosyncratic, in a way. I mean, I'm not saying it isn't true. It's just that from our perspective, it's always been sort of a strange thing to consider or a hard thing to sort of see from the outside, and I think for the reason Ethan was saying. We just kind of approach each story on its own terms, and you try and tell it the best way that you can sort of imagine, and you don't think about it sort of in terms of being strange or quirky. 

Do-- were you a fan of their work before you married one of the Coen brothers? 

Well, they didn't have any work when I met them. 

Oh, is that right? 

(Crosstalk) 

Is that right? 

I met them on the first film, Blood Simple, which was my first film. 

Yeah. 

So we all kind of started doing it at the same time. After a week, I was a big fan. 

You were a big fan. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

A big fan, a big fan after working with them for a week. 

Was it their work or-- 

It was, it was a really unique experience in that probably most of the people on the set, on the crew and the cast-- I think Emmet Walsh, who was an actor in the film, he was the oldest person on the set. So it was, you know, it was kind of a lot of people starting on what they wanted to do professionally for the rest of their lives. 

How is it different? I mean-- 

Well, I'd never done a movie before, so I, I didn't have anything to compare it to. I only-- 

But you have now. 

--had theater. How is it different working with them? 

Yeah. 

There's no tension on their sets. I mean, obviously there's the tension if a major problem comes up, but it's kind of just like hanging out. 

Yeah. 

And you end up with a movie at the end of it. But I think it's because they collaborate together from the very beginning of the writing process that everybody feels like it's a collaborative effort. 

Tell me about your character in this movie. 

What do you want to know? 

Well, I mean, this is-- I've seen Fargo, obviously, and it's a-- everybody is talking about it. I mean, it just-- it's a wonderful film. But you know that, and critics have said that. 

I think it's-- I think maybe it seems strangely exotic to people because you haven't seen it on screen before. 

Haven't seen-- 

Minnesota. 

--what? Oh, Minnesota. 

Minnesota. The landscape, the lakes, the, the-- 

The flatness and the-- 

--dialect-- 

--and the co-- and-- 

--the music of the dialect. 

--you can feel the cold. I could. And the dialect is the most striking thing, the way people talk, yes? 

Yeah. It's a music. It's a music, but it's in a script because they're from there. 

I know. I was going to say you-- did you want to do the film about Minnesota about Minnesota? I mean, is Minnesota a character in this film. 

Oh, yeah. I think very much so. In our minds it was. I think-- yeah, that was one of the big attractions to us about this was doing a movie about the place we grew up in. And als-- you know, it's also talking about the sort of rhythm of the speech and the way people talk there. I mean, that's frequently the way we sort of get into imagining characters when we're writing them. It frequently starts with the way they talk. 

Ethan, set this up. This is a scene in which Frances' character, who is Sheriff Brennan, investigates a crime scene, where this car had gone off the road and snowy strip of-- you know, ''It's Just Morning Sickness.'' Set up this scene for me before we take a look at it for the audience at home who haven't seen the film and clearly would want to will appreciate this scene more. 

Yeah. This is pretty much the introduction of Fran's character. Fran is the chief of police of a small town in rural Minnesota, and she's been called to investigate the site of a triple homicide, which we, the audience, have seen the whole sort of setup and the perpetration of the crime. A state trooper has been killed and two people who we, the audience, know were just sort of innocent passersby, and we see Fran here sort of reconstructing this-- the crime from examining the scene. 

All right. Roll the tape. Here it is. (Clip from ''Fargo'') Well, there it is. 

I guess I should have mentioned when I set it up that Fran's character is also seven months pregnant. 

Exactly. Here-- tell me about the writing process, the two of you. I mean, I think it was Sam Ram-- Ramey who said that watching you guys work was like watching badminton, that there was a kind of give and take, that the process was-- 

That (crosstalk) And no-- it's a very genteel sport. Actually, it is true that in terms of writing we do sort of-- writers who collaborate sometimes split, split a script up, and one does one scene and one does another and then somehow they graft it together. We in fact don't work that way, but just sort of talk each scene through back and forth. 

And how much does the actor add to it? Fran? 

Well, they cast really well, and what's interesting about working with them as opposed to other directors I've worked with, there's not a lot of improvisation. You stick to the script because you want to. It's really well written. It's kind of like a play. So I think a lot of it has to do with the casting. And because they write for so many actors they know. 

Yeah, but I think it was Nick Cage who said that, that it was difficult to work with you guys because you pretty much set the character that you wanted, you know, and then therefore you cast who fits-- which is what you said. Casting is, is a huge part of it, not so much having the actor define the character. Does that mean that you agree, or does that mean that it's interesting? 

Well, I think in Nick's case, Nick's got a-- I understand why he said that, actually. In Nick's case, he's got such a fertile imagination, you know, and, and he's-- you know, all kinds of wild stuff occurs to Nick. At least this, you know, this was a while ago that we worked with him, but all kinds of wild stuff occurs to him while he's on the set. And I think in Raising Arizona, to a certain extent it was our job to kind of sit on that a little bit, which, to tell you the truth, I'd much rather sort of edit an actor than have to sort of kick him to get, you know- to sort of stimulate that kind of thinking. It was a lot of fun working with him, but it was kind of editing, to-- 

But you'd rather-- 

--a certain extent. 

--do that than have to-- 

Absolutely. 

--jump start. 

Absolutely. 

You also spend a lot of time -- I'm talking a lot about process here, but it's interesting because you're different -- a lot of time on preparation. I mean, you really-- I assume it's cost effective, and that's part of the reason you do it. 

Yeah. I mean, we, you know, come from low budget filmmaking and are still practitioners of it, and you know, when we first started out doing Blood Simple, where we were doing a movie for less than a million dollars, you had to be able to say to the designer, for instance, you know, we need this wall and this wall, but not that wall. And in order to be that precise in terms of sort of shepherding the resources and making-- getting the most bang for your buck, we really had to thoroughly sort of think out how we were going to shoot each scene. And to a certain extent, the way we work now is still kind of a, you know, a product of that mindset. 

Right. Also, I mean, in terms of doing-- well, certainly not so much in the case of this movie, but our previous one was sort of heavily an effects movie, which you have to pre-plan and to a large extent, again, more than we had to in this movie, which was-- there wasn't much in the way of effects, virtually nothing in the way of visual effects. 

Did you-- did your movies make money? 

Well, you know, it's-- some of them have, and some of them haven't. 

Depends on who's keeping the records, doesn't it? 

Yeah, exactly. As Art Buchwald said, ''I never would have sued Paramount if I thought-- knew it was a nonprofit organization.'' You know, the last one did really poorly. 

The last one did not. 

This one, this one looks like it's going to do fine. Raising Arizona made a lot of money. 

Yeah. 

Barton Fink made a lot of money overseas, and did not do well here. Blood Simple, our first movie, for the budget it was made on-- 

Yeah. (Crosstalk) 

--made a lot of money. 

Yeah. 

So on balance, actually, despite our sort of rap, most of our movies have. 

Could you, could you create a movie, if you decided to go for the bucks -- forget moi, forget all this stuff, forget genre-- 

If we were good boys. 

Yeah. I mean, just-- Come on, fellas! Make me a movie that's going to make me some money! 

You sound like Phil Silver. 

Yeah. That's right. I'm Phil Silver. 

Yeah. 

Come on, now. I'm going to give you a shot to make a movie that'll make some money. Can you do it or not? 

It's a good-- 

Or are you hung up on all this little-- 

In terms of big money like (crosstalk)-- 

--art? Are you hung up on art, guys? 

They're not hung up on art. 

I guess it's still an open question, isn't it? 

It certainly is. 

To us, anyway. Maybe some people plant the bucks out there. 

You haven't given up on the idea. 

Yeah. No, we'd love to do that, to tell you the truth, honestly. 

But the question is, could you. 

I don't know. I don't know. You know, I'd like to think we could but I don't know. So far we haven't made a movie that's-- 

Yeah. 

Raising Ari-- 

Because it takes a certain skill to be a-- to say to yourself-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, ''I'm going to make a commercial judgment, and every (unintelligible)'' and therefore you give, in a sense, you have to pass on what your instincts might be. 

Right. That's, that's frequently the case. 

If I had to do that, I'd be lost. 

Yeah. 

Yeah, but then on the other hand, I mean, you know, first of all, one always hopes, and secondly, I mean, in terms of what-- 

It's a quirky business. 

Yeah. 

You know? 

It's like notoriously idiosyncratic, what works and what doesn't. And then thirdly, we do like to do different kinds of things, so maybe one of the experiments will sort of hit the jackpot. 

Okay. Frances, tell me what do you like about this character, this sheriff? 

She's good at her job. 

Yeah. 

She's really good at her job. And I also, I also really like the idea that, you know, she was pregnant, but that was just a fact of her life. 

Yeah. 

You know, she's got blonde hair, she's pregnant, she's just going about business. And I think that she's in her-- you know, she's extremely simple to figure out. There's not much, not much complicated-- 

Straightforward. 

--about Marge, but she, she's still surprising. She still surprises an audience. 

How about the relationship with her husband, which is a very interesting little take? 

It's great. I think it's great. I mean, it's interesting because a lot of people have called it role reversal of a, kind of a classic marriage situation, which I think is kind of short-sighted because-- 

She's the bread winner; he's the artist. 

Yeah. It's not that simple. They're both doing what they're good at. 

Yeah. 

John Lynch, the actor that played Norm, he and I had a kind of little actors' story on the side that they were probably both on the police force, and she was better at it, and so she moved up through the ranks because only one of them could in a small town police department, and he got to go home and do what he really wanted to pursue, which was his wildlife artistry. 

Even to getting it on a stamp. 

Get-- which is a huge, you know-- 

Yeah. 

It's a huge accomplishment for him. So I think it, it's great. I, I think at the end of the story, you know, they're doing really well. 

I want to show another clip. But before I do, talk about the ensemble characters-- I mean, the people that come. Steve Buscemi is just terrific in this film. And others. Is it-- 

It-- yeah. This really was probably more than anything else that we've done sort of an ensemble cast because you can't really point to any one role in the movie as sort of carrying the movie or being the lead role in the movie. 

Frances more than anyone else. 

Frances more than anyone else, but-- 

She's just bigger. 

Yeah. She's pregnant, yeah. 

It's true, Fran more than-- Fran is kind of the center of the movie, but there are all these sort of satellites that keep spinning through the movie-- 

Yeah. 

--and it really is sort of an ensemble cast, I think more than the other stuff we did. 

Some brilliant performances. Set this clip up. This is-- let me tell you where it is. This is, this is where ''I'm Joey Lundegard.'' Set it up for me. 

This is where-- 

No, this is where they meet the two guys and-- 

Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. This is the beginning of the movie, which-- 

This is the beginning of the film. I should say this. These are out of order. This is before we know anything, before the scene you saw in which the sheriff discovers the scene of one of the crimes. 

Yeah, this is the kidnapping, which-- kidnapping scheme which precipitates the events that we saw, yeah, earlier. But I don't think it needs much setup since it is-- 

No, I don't either. Well, let me-- 

--the very very beginning of the movie. 

--just set this up. What this story is about-- this is a story of a man who wants to buy into a real estate venture and he comes up with a scheme that what he will do is he will kidnap-- he will hire some people to kidnap his wife because he believes that his wife's rich father will pay enough money for him to go ahead and make this real estate investment, which somehow will be the salvation of all of his problems. Here is the beginning of that film, in which they are talking about that scheme. Roll the tape. (Clip from ''Fargo'') The character who comes in playing Joe Lundegard is William Macy. 

Right. 

He gives a brilliant, wonderful performance-- One of a number. 

Bill really want to say-- it was going to be a Blue Sierra, the car that he's paying him off with, but Bill really wanted to say ''burnt umber Sierra.'' 

So you allowed him to have some reins there, did you? 

It was a little improvisation. 

Improvisation. Burnt orange or-- Janet Maslin, who is frequently on this program, said that the title is about seeing how far the Coens can go - Far-go. 

Well, boy. I hadn't thought about it that way. 

We just-- you know, we hadn't really given (crosstalk) 

Was this a joke, she would say, with the audience or the film community? 

Oh, no. No. I mean, we were- Just in terms of the title, we were sort of presented with the-- you know, in our own minds of, you know, calling it either Fargo or Brainard, which is the other town it takes place in, which we thought sort of-- 

Fargo was better. 

Yeah. But no. I mean, this is, in a weird kind of a way, for us, it's just- as Ethan was saying, kind of-- you kind of, from project to project, you look for something different to do, and for us, this was sort of an interesting experiment and a different kind of approach, a more sort of naturalistic approach to the story. 

Barry Sonnenfeld used to be your cinematographer? 

Yeah. 

He's now gone on to be a director. 

Right. 

You have a new cinematographer who is? 

Yeah. Roger Deacons, who shot the last three movies that we've done. Yeah. Three-- Roger's-- and again, I mean, we worked very closely with Barry on the first three and very closely-- 

Right. 

--with Roger on-- 

How do you divide up responsibilities? 

Between the two of us? 

Mm-hm. 

Well, it's pretty loose. I mean, we almost don't. I mean, we don't, really, in any formal way, in any defined way. It's very fluid. I mean, and it starts with writing which, as I said, was very back and forth, and that just pretty much continues through the whole production of the movie. 

Good luck with Fargo. Great to have you-- 

Thanks. 

--here. 

Thanks. 

Great to see you again. Last time I saw Frances was Sisters Rosenzweig, Wendy's great play. Wendy Wasserman. Thank you very much.
