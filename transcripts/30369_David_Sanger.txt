We continue now with David Sanger of "The New York Times" who was in Moscow. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also in Moscow, where he met with Russian president Vladimir Putin late today at the Kremlin. That meeting came amid heightened tensions between the two nations. It was the first face to face meeting of the Russian leader with a top Trump administration official. Earlier this week the White House accused Putin's government of covering up Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's role in the chemical attack. Putin in turn charged the Trump administration with having fabricated evidence implicating the Syrian government. Today's meeting could determine future relations between Russia and the United States. David Sanger is the national security correspondent for "The New York Times." He joins me from Moscow and I join him by congratulating him on the recipient for his team of a Pulitzer Prize. Congratulations. 

Thanks very much, Charlie. It was a great team and all Russia related. It was the story of the Russian hack and the Russian disinformation program. 

So you get to Moscow and there's much drama this morning as we went to broadcast at CBS about whether Vladimir Putin would meet with Rex Tillerson. Why did he decide to do it? Did he always decide to do it? Has there been any reporting on the subject? 

Well, that would be inside Vladimir Putin's head, but we've seen this before, moments where he kept John Kerry and even President Obama at various points, sort of on tender hooks about whether or when he would meet. So, we've seen this happen. Although in this case, because he knows Mr. Tillerson from the days that Mr. Tillerson was the chief executive of ExxonMobil, it surprised us a little bit because he was obviously dealing with a known quantity here. This was the first meeting, Charlie, between anybody from -- senior in the Trump administration and Vladimir Putin, or at least the first one that we know about. And so it was somewhat critical to watch whether or not they could get past this remarkably different set of facts they've been describing. And based on the only voice we've heard since then, which was Mr. Tillerson at a news conference with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, it doesn't sound like they've gotten any closer on the facts. The American view is that it was the Syrian regime that was responsible for the sarin gas attack. Mr. Putin himself in other interviews today, or broadcasts today, gave some completely alternative theories. They're still not in the same place about who hacked into the election process. While Mr. Tillerson hasn't wanted to dwell on it since his boss is a skeptic, he said it's basically an established fact that Russia messed with it. And of course Putin has denied that. 

What's interesting to me is that a lot of people, from Putin to Tillerson to others, are saying that the relationship is at a low point. What are the implications of that? 

Well, the implication is what happens if it spirals downward? I mean, we can fight over Syria. We had proxy wars that went on throughout the cold war. We don't have the numbers of nuclear weapons pointed at each other, thank goodness, that we did at the height of the cold war. We don't have this sense of Russia as a rising power that is going to challenge us that we had during the cold war. That role has been taken on now by China. But we certainly do have a sense of contention. And that contention is really in three or four different places. It is over Crimea and the Ukraine and Mr. Tillerson said again today there would be no relaxation of sanctions until that's solved. I don't see a solution getting close on that. It's over Europe where the Russians are now meddling in the elections the way they did in our case. It's over the election investigation, which whether or not this is supposed to be a distraction from, that's chugging forward. And then of course it's over Russia's general view that its role is to be the spoiler for the United States, the counterweight to NATO. And I think that the big transition we've seen in the past week is that Donald Trump has come around to thinking that maybe the Russians have been pretty disruptive actors. Not something you heard during the campaign or even the first 80 days of the presidency. 

The interesting thing, too, is where the United States is tonight with respect to the future of Bashar al-Assad. 

Well, part of the difficulty that we've had in the past week since the missile strike last Thursday, Charlie, has been getting the administration to explain what its strategic objectives are in Syria. So the narrowest explanation they've offered was this is to stop the use of chemical weapons again. Then Sean Spicer, the press secretary came out and said no, it's to stop violence against the Syrian people and left open the possibility we could retaliate for barrel bombs and the other horrors that have been rained on the Syrian people by the Assad regime. Then we heard from Nikki Haley that maybe this was really about regime change, something that Mr. Tillerson has denied. Then we've heard that maybe it's about protecting the Syrian people, setting up safe zones or no-fly zones and so forth, which would be a far more complex operation. Now, you could argue you've got an administration that is only 80 days into its time in office. They haven't had time to figure out their goals. But what we do know is that's very different from what Donald Trump was saying during the campaign which was we shouldn't be involved in these kind of conflicts at all. America first means focusing on America within its borders. 

Yes. It's interesting too, how the president, President Trump has referred to the president of Russia as saying, you know, he's supporting a very bad man. And clearly we had the Secretary of Defense presenting evidence why they were sure that this came from Bashar al-Assad and the United States makes sure it notes that there are Russians who are connected to where this took place. And that they clearly, you would expect, to have known because of their proximity. Not only that there were chemical weapons there, which is a violation of the treaty, but also that the Russians should've seen what they were doing and planning to do. 

Well, Tillerson said the other day that the Russians were either incompetent or it had the wool pulled over their eyes by their Syrian hosts. And there were upwards of a hundred Russians on this base where the United States maintains the planes took off laden with the chemical weapons. So even though it's a big base, it is hard to believe that the Russians had no idea what was going on. The Russians today called for an investigation led by criminal investigators at the Hague to figure out what happened and who was responsible. But Putin, just hours before he met Rex Tillerson, laid out these different theories including that the Syrians had mistakenly hit a warehouse that was full of this material, that it belonged to terror groups. Or that the United States and its allies had set this entire thing up as a hoax in an effort to go try to force Assad out. What is clear is this. The American view now, not a week ago, is that Assad has to go. And the only question is, how do you orchestrate that? And the Russian view is that this set of events has driven them closer to Bashar al-Assad and more intent on holding on to him. 

Because it represents their national interest and their special interest in having a port there, which is their largest port outside of the Russian border? 

The port is part of it, but I think a good deal more of it as well has been that with the military move into Syria, President Putin has on the cheap given Russia a much larger role in the Middle East than it has had in decades. It's made it the deciding force that has kept Assad in power, along, of course, with the Iranians. And so all the early talk that President Trump had about, why can't we be friends, don't we have common interests here, can't we come to some common interest in fighting ISIS and all that, I think the overall message of the trip that Mr. Tillerson took here was not any time too soon. And you have to wonder whether or not Mr. Tillerson came equipped with enough policy options to break this logjam. You didn't hear many big ideas today about reviving the process that John Kerry started up called the Geneva process, bringing Syria and all of its neighbors together. You heard about some small working groups to try to work out smaller differences between Russia and the United States. But that seemed to be mostly a cover, an effort to say, well, we've done something. 

The other thing that is interesting and apparent from interviews that President Trump has done here in the United States with "The Wall Street Journal" and with "Fox News" is that he says, I still hold to the position that I held before, that we have no business in going in and getting involved in a civil war, and in any significant way. 

Well, that's true. And he has said that repeatedly. But at the same time he hasn't made that compatible with a strategy that would actually remove Assad from power with the help of the Syrian people. You've got to stop the war to be able to do that so the Syrian people can take an honest and real vote. And that means a lot of Syrians no longer living in Syria. And he hasn't made it compatible with the rest of the strategy. I did think it was interesting tonight when we were at the Russian Foreign Ministry and Secretary Tillerson and Foreign Minister Lavrov were both talking, that Lavrov turned to Tillerson and gave him a five or ten minute tutorial on all the times the United States had gone about regime change in his mind in recent years and seen it go bad. He went back to Bill Clinton's intervention in the Balkans and Slobodan Milosevic's removal, then he went forward to Saddam Hussein under the false pretenses of weapons of mass destruction, then he took it to Libya and what happened after Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown. The moral of the story as you listened to Lavrov was that every time you Americans go in and do this, you then get out and leave a vacuum with a giant mess, which sounds a lot like what Donald Trump used to say on the campaign trail. 

We still don't know how President Putin sizes up President Trump, do we? 

They both revel in being unpredictable. We didn't see Putin going in to grab Crimea, for example. They both are highly transactional. They are not terribly ideological. And I think the final one and the most important one is that they both have this sense that their countries have, for some reason or another, not been able to exercise the kind of power that they're due. And they are determined to fix that. Now, you could imagine two people with those common views finding a way to have an accord because they're not ideological enemies. You could also imagine this spinning a bit out of control because both of them are vying to bring their countries back to the kind of global influence that they imagined from a previous glory era. 

David Sanger from Moscow, thank you for joining us. 

Thank you, Charlie. Great to be with you.
