Another hostage was released in the Mideast today. One of the leading stories at home was the beginning of the William Kennedy Smith trial in Palm Beach. In a moment we'll be reviewing the opening day proceedings with three top attorneys. Also with us tonight, Paul Goldberg, a cultural news editor of The New York Times. A bit later in the hour we'll hear a passionate debate about where homeless shelters belong as the cry continues, "Not in my backyard." First, it was day one in the rape trail of William Kennedy Smith. There has been legal wrangling as to what evidence can be admitted, whether the jury can hear testimony from three other women who claim William Smith sexually assaulted them or testimony which goes to the sexual history of the alleged victim of the rape in Palm Beach. Here to discuss these issues and more are three of the top criminal defense attorneys in New York, Jack Litman who defended Robert Chambers in the Jennifer Levin case, Ira London who defended Joel Steinberg and David Lewis who defended Carolyn Warmus in the so-called fatal attraction case. Welcome back to each of you. We have talked before about criminal defense trials. Here we look, and the reason I want to do this tonight is that we look at the first day when some important things happened. You have a jury that has been chosen. Secondly, you have a critical decision by the judge in ruling on the admission of the testimony or at least of these three women who had given depositions in the case. Also, you have the opening statements. Let me talk first about selection of the jury. What can we say? Some are saying the defense had a major advantage because they have three so-called experts there to help them in choosing a potential jury. Does it make that much difference? Edward Bennett Williams used to say, "Just give me the first twelve." 

I don't think too many of us would take the first twelve. I'm not sure it makes a monumental difference to have experts there, but it can certainly add a little bit. Experts can pick up certain things about body language and other aspects of a personality of an individual that lawyers sometimes miss. I think it's really the sixth sense of the trial lawyer who's been there time and time again who makes the ultimate decision. 

You were there, and you were examining the witness, and you're representing the defense, Mr. Smith. What are you looking for in a juror that you want to be sitting? 

You certainly want somebody who is A of an open mind and who doesn't have a prejudice against someone who lives high up on the hill. That's definitely what you're looking for. 

Someone who doesn't hate the Kennedy's. 

It's more than just someone who doesn't hate the Kennedy's. I would assume that anyone who articulated such an overt prejudice would be long gone from the jury process, but someone who doesn't just want to see someone up on the hill and say, "That person, I want to drag him down." 

David, put your hat on the other side. You're the prosecutor. Who do you want to see on that jury? 

I think they're going to look for jurors that will believe that there is no such thing as a consent, and that a sexual act done by someone, and the victim comes in and says, "No, I didn't agree to this," that person, that juror is going to say, "If there was no agreement, then there had to be a rape." There's no black or white. You're looking for a juror if you're a prosecution who sees things in black and white and not able to tolerate ambiguity. 

Conventional wisdom is the following, that it would be better for the defense or the defense seems to be looking for older women, whatever older means and young men. 

It's not unusual in a consent issue rape case that what you want is someone who is going to look down on the victim and look down on the victims. 

And say, "Why was she there at 3:00 am on the beach?" 

Yeah. It's like, my children weren't there, or a young man who say I know why someone would be wanting to do that. You're looking for stereotypes or, if you will, prejudices that benefit you. That's one perspective. By the way, I disagree with Jack about using juror workers. I think they're invaluable, and Cat Bennett who was the principal person picking that jury, I work with, and she is brilliant. There is nobody like her. 

Why is she brilliant, and what does she bring to the table? 

She is able to discern things in the answers that give her follow up questions that when you ask those questions you open up that juror, and you're able to have the juror freely express their opinions and their views. She gives encouragement to the lawyers because we're not really eager to be open to the jurors. She opens us up to the jurors and allows them to open themselves up to us. It's an amazing process. When she helps you pick a jury, by the time you're done, you feel secure that what you've got there is the fairest group of people you're going to get. There aren't too many people like that, but there are jury workers who can do that. They help a lawyer far more than I think. 

Before I go to Ira, you disagree with that, or we have a conflict here or not? 

It's not a conflict. I told you sometimes they can be very helpful. I still say it's the sense of the trial lawyer in the end that's going to make a decision. I think a good trial lawyer knows how to open up with a jury and get conversation because this is the only opportunity you have in a trial to talk with the jury, not at a jury. 

Now that's an interesting point (inaudible). 

The legendary trial lawyers that we know of still insist that they go by instinct. Based on their track record they're usually right. What David says about Cat Bennett is true. She's a remarkable person, she has a feel for people. 

She's trained as a psychologist, is she? 

I believe she's a trained social psychologist. 

There are many like her in the country. 

She happens to be extraordinarily good, but there are several in the country. 

It still is instinctive. It's something that you get a feel for a person. 

Back to the point that Jack was talking about. What does a defense attorney want to do in terms of his demeanor with that jury of which out of that group is coming, six that are going to be sitting and listening to his or her case? 

The defense lawyer in that case has to give the feeling to the jury that he is looking for the truth in the case, that he's fair-minded, that he's not going to manipulate the witnesses in the case. 

I think the most important thing that the defense lawyer has to do in that case is to exude a sense of not only confidence but sincerity. He has to show that he believes is, I think Mr. Black is actually doing, that he believes in his client's innocence. It's very critical in this because there's an unusual aspect in this case that not too many people have talked about. As you know, in a criminal trial the defense benefits from the presumption of innocence and the burden beyond a reasonable doubt where the scales have to tip extraordinarily in one direction in order for the prosecution to convict. When you put on an affirmative case in a trial, the jurors tend to lose sight of that. What they do is they look at both stories, and they say, "Which story is more plausible, the prosecution story or the defense story?" Sometimes you run a risk of losing the burden of proof, and you simply have the jury look at a balancing test. Which side appears to be more plausible? It's the defense attorney's job to exude the kind of sincerity and confidence in his case to overcome that. 

How did Black do, well? 

I thought Black did extraordinarily well during the jury selection process, at least the little bit that I saw. 

I think he's done very well. He also projects a tremendous amount of dignity in the middle of a process that is itself dealing with some seemingly unpleasant issues. If you are able to stand above the fray, if you will, and keep your head as Roy Black has done through watching the jury selection on court TV and seeing what's being done, then you really I think project to the jury I can be a guide that you can rely on through this mess. That's really what you're trying to do. You're trying to establish yourself as a truth-teller in that room. 

Your credibility with the jury. 

It's the most important thing. 

This crucial ruling today by the judge that the deposition or the testimony of these three women who had come forward to say they had had a problem. 

Past sexual misconduct. 

That's even though there had been no criminal action, no legal proceeding. How significant is that for the defense? 

I think it was expected. If it wasn't expected, I think she would have allowed the defense to go into that in great detail with the jury in the voir dire process. It's not surprising. It certainly would be the ruling in this state by a trial judge. 

It's a major victory for the defense. 

It's a major victory, if you thought that the prosecution was going to get that in. To get that in the prosecution has to show that the pattern of conduct on the other three matters was exactly the same and matched exactly the same as the pattern of conduct that they allege in this case. 

As someone said it almost in Florida law has to be a cat burglar who always wore pink, pink whatever they said. 

It has the Jack the Ripper syndrome. It would have to be a signature type of- 

This was not true in these cases, therefore- 

Well apparently not. I mean after all, two of them, the women talked him out of it, assuming any of this ever occurred by the way. 

Yeah. 

In the third case, or the third incident, it allegedly was consummated. What I think what's most critical about this for the country and what I found very disappointing about what the judge did is that she didn't articulate a single reason for what she did. Ira: She just said- There's nothing worse than if you're a lawyer, obviously the defense is not going to quarrel with success, and rightfully so, but for the country at large, I think that people would like to have seen her to articulate reasons why she did it. Nothing worse than when you're a lawyer and you've worked hard for something and then have the judge say, "Denied," or, "Granted," without giving a reason. 

In Florida it's called the Williams role and the denial was based on the Williams role and in a sense she need not say anything more. The other thing about it is not only is it expected, but in a consent case, his prior activity sheds no more light on what has happened in some ways than what the victim's prior activity might have been. Even then, that's not an exact match, but we don't know whether this victim consented more or less based on what happened with William Kennedy Smith and some other woman. It tells us nothing about her state of mind. That's an important fact in understanding why it's excluded. If anything, if it comes in, it shows a propensity which we do not try cases on because that implies that someone who does sinning will continue to do it, thereby removing the decision from the jury. 

There is still a risk, though be it very slight, and I doubt that Roy Black is going to fall into the trap of allowing it to a curb, but there is a risk that some of this evidence may still be admissible during the trial. 

How? 

If the defense, to use the words we use as trial lawyers use, opens the door to this type of testimony. 

How could the defense do that? 

For example, if foolishly Smith gets on the witness stand and he says, "I am always extraordinarily chivalrous whenever I am with a woman. I have never raised my hand to a woman in my entire life." Let's assume he were to say something like that. Well if he were to open the door that way, then certainly I would think the prosecution would be allowed to call each one of these women to the witness stand to rebut what he said. I would doubt very much the testimony in that vein would be admitted at this trial. 

It's probably too early to tell- 

"Always," and, "Never," are the two words that his lawyer has told him every day, "Do not use." 

All right, so far, it's probably too early to tell, but do you think Smith will take the stand? 

Charlie- 

Too early. 

I wish I could give you prediction on that. I couldn't call that one. 

You have to wait until you see- 

The little bit I've heard from the opening statement, I think you could call it pretty clearly and say he's definitely going to take the witness stand. 

He is, because they view him as credible and will help his own case? 

Well I think it's not only that, I mean he got up and say, "This was an act of consensual sexual intercourse and that what happened here was an act of love between two adults who were having a good time. There was foreplay and whatever," it's going to be very difficult to prove the content of that without putting him on the witness stand. 

The problem also is that while they have a lot of expert witness and science and technical witnesses, the fact is the jury is going to look at him and if he doesn't take the stand, it's a little hard to believe that it's a consent defense if the man who can basically explain it elects not to take the stand. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the judge will explain that this should not be held against him and she's already said that in her opening instructions to the jury, that it is not a presumption of guilt or anything else. It could be read into the fact that a defendant does or does not take the stand. 

The law can't make you wiser, the law can't make fairer. It can only make you listen. 

Let me come to another question, did you see or hear the opening statements by the prosecution? Can you speak to that? 

I can speak to it. 

All right, tell me what you thought. What do you know about the opening statements? Did any of you see the opening statements by the prosecutor? What do you think the prosecution has to prove? What should the prosecution be saying to that jury? 

Well I believe- 

How would they make their case in an opening statement? 

I heard one 30 second spin on it, and apparently she was characterizing him as a very physically abusive person who turned on her, who became, to use the clichÃ©, an animal all of a sudden and forced her, physically compelled her to perform a sexual act. I think they're going to try to characterize his actions as those of someone who became very physically aggressive. That's all I got from it. 

It's hard to say. I mean there are basically two tacts that she can take. One tact is- 

This is the prosecutor? 

This is the prosecutor now, one tact is basically to say, "All right it started consensually." If she agreed to speak with him at the bar, perhaps have drinks and certainly to go back to the estate with him- 

To walk out to the beach. 

And to walk out onto the beach, but a woman obviously has autonomy over her own body and if she wants to say, "No," that has to be respected. That's one tact she can take, and I didn't get the sense of that during her opening statement. I got the sense, "He's an animal. He was very violent. He was abusive physically." 

He tackled me. He tackled her, sorry, it's tackled her. 

It's as if she's afraid to buy into the argument that women are autonomous, and I don't know why she did that, although I'm judging this as Ira did, basically on only 30 or 45 seconds worth that I read in the newspaper. 

I think Jack's dichotomy is perfect. I think that what she did from what I've seen or from what I've read on the wire copy today is that she took on much more than she needed to take on. She's now made him into this animal. Well Willy Smith walking along with John Kennedy Jr. and all of that, that's not animal sort of stuff and so the imagery that we're getting- 

Three women that are sitting there at the defense's table- 

All of them perfectly safe. 

Quickly excused the minute the jury came in. 

The women at the defense table? 

I'm sorry, I thought you meant. 

The bottom line is that she's created an image that's larger than what she needs to prove and I think the jury is seeing. She might have lost the game. They say that 80% of the jury's minds are made up in opening statements. 

Is that right? 

That's what they say. 

The conventional wisdom among- 

That's the conventional wisdom. 

Trial aficionados is that 80% of the jurors have already made of their mind. 

That's right. 

That's conventional wisdom. 

You don't buy that. 

No, certainly not in a case like this. 

I believe it. I believe it because that's the thing they hear first and that's the thing that sticks with them and that's what they match all through the trial. 

Based on everything you know, it seems that this was a good day for the defense in this case and secondly, that the prosecution has an uphill battle, is it fair to say, characterize it that way so far David? 

It was a good day for the law because what was excluded was what should have been excluded, so the defense wins and so does the prosecution if the law is upheld. It was a good day for the defense because I though Roy Black's opening statement laid the groundwork for the rest of his case and the prosecutor bit off a big chunk. She might not be able to come through. 

She may be taking a tact, I don't think it's a wash- 

She may know something we don't know. 

Well first of all she might, but she may take a tact, "Let me go this far out on a limb," and then hopefully the jury will fall in the middle so that maybe she says, by calling him an animal, maybe she'll say, she'll hope that some of the jury will say, "Well he's not an animal, but still she's autonomous and has a right to say no." If that's her tact I think it's a big mistake. 

She, in the end, the prosecution's case clearly will depend to a large extent on the testimony of the complaining witness. 

Without a doubt. 

It may very well, despite everything it said and all that we might speculate on, depend on how good a witness that person is. I read a thing about a law, the person who took the lie detector test of her who said to the defense, or one of the members of the defense team saying, "This is one, you guys have trouble because this is one very effective witness." Whether that's true or not, I don't know. 

If he testifies, the case then shifts to be ratification about his credibility as well. 

If he testifies. 

If he testifies. 

It's his credibility, not hers. 

No, her credibility is now- 

It's both. 

It becomes a balancing act, but let's not forget about the forensic evidence in this case. I think the forensic evidence may well turn out to be an important key for the jury in breaking the gaudy or not as to which side to believe because her story depend on a variety of things having occurred. For example- 

Forensic evidence is- 

How about simply- 

Clothes torn. 

That there was really a struggle, struggle, struggle and apparently there's nothing with the clothing. Now you're going to have experts, two of whom I've used as experts before who are very good witnesses who are going to testify- 

For the defense. 

For the defense. 

Thank you all. Thank you Ira, thank you Jack, thank you David. 

You're welcome. 

Maybe we'll meet again as this trial progresses. We'll be back in a moment with Paul Goldberger. Stay with us. For the last 20 years, Paul Goldberger as the arbiter of architecture in The New York Times, has made his mark on the sacred skyline of the city, like no other critic. In 1984, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his commentary. Just last year, as the old gray lady braced itself for a makeover, he was named the powerful post of Cultural News Editor. His charges have the first and often the last word on what we see in a theater, eat in a restaurant, or watch on television. We're pleased to have Paul Goldberger join us now, to talk about his new job at The Times, as well as architecture here in the city. First, the new job. You have all of the ... Who reports to you? What reporters? 

All the reporters who cover cultural affairs, arts, and entertainment, and all the critics. 

The notion is, that this gives you some exalted notion in the city because the power of The Times. Because Frank Rich and all those people who have powerful influence over culture, somehow, you know- 

The real truth is, it's widely exaggerated, I think. I wish I can sit here and say to you, "We have absolute power over everything." 

This is one powerful man. 

What we decree opens, what we decree closes, what we decree succeeds, and what we decree fails. In fact, it's not really true at all. I think we have enormous authority. Everybody reads The Times, everybody pays attention to what we say, everybody listens. But then in fact they do whatever they please. 

Frank is a better known name, I mean there are a lot of other people with equal power and skill at The Times with ... Certainly equal skill. Do you edit Frank Rich's copy? 

Lightly, yes. Heavily, no. We believe that we have the best critics of any newspaper in America. We want people we don't want to edit very much. In fact, as a critic myself, I have an enormous sense of respect for writer's voice. I didn't like it when people played around with my voice. Now as an editor, I don't want to play around with other people's voices. I think the most important thing is to, sort of nurture writers and critics so that they will speak most naturally in their own voices. I don't feel that it's our job to shape and change them. If they're wrong, if they're no good, if they don't have a natural feel for what they're doing, we should really get other people. 

You should change critics, rather that edit their copy? 

We should change critics. Exactly. Right. I don't what to make myself into the theater critic. I don't want to make myself into a movie critic. I don't want to make myself into a dance critic. 

Is there pressure on you from the business interest, that advertise in The Times? In any way people who say, "My God, look what you guys are doing to the city, because of the criticism that comes from your paper?" 

There's a little bit. Except The Times has always being really forthright and wonderful, in fact, in creating a kind of church and state separation. Our business affairs as a company, as a newspaper are separate from what we put into the paper. We think our reputation really comes from that. That we write with a sense of independence, that is not connected to our advertising columns. There have been times when people have pulled their advertising, and generally- 

Because they didn't like- Because they thought- 

Because they didn't like something that was said and they- 

Critics said- 

Generally come quietly creeping back after a period of time. We make a point of not deliberately antagonizing people. We try not to have our criticism be personal. We feel ultimately the greatest respect we can show is applying high standards fairly and across the board. 

Asking you to speak for the paper, and especially the area that you cover, whether is architecture, whether is theater whatever, restaurants or whatever it is. How do you guard yourself and make sure that the opinions expressed are judicious? How do you check your own power? 

Well we do, in fact, try to check our own power. We review our own stuff very carefully to be sure that it meets the kind of standard of fairness, is the only way to put it. 

Book review is another good example, that I've forgotten about- 

Sure. Sure. We will say, that this book does not represent the highest standards, the writer seems to have failed to do this, that, and the other thing. We don't write that the writer's a sleazeball. We don't write that this movie that is not very good fails because the director's an idiot. We may write that the movie- 

This is the kind of saying that John Simon might say in a review. 

I mean we may well write that the movie is a cataclysmic failure. We may well write that- 

That the director is awful? 

We're stunned that there could be such a miscalculation, the direction is awful, the acting is terrible, it's a total waste of two hours and umpteen millions of dollars, but we don't write ad hominem attacks on- 

If you saw that you may call that reporter on that or that critic on that point- 

That's right. Absolutely. 

And say we are not going to allow that pass. 

We don't do it this way. This is not our way. We don't want to reign you in too much, if you really feel that the work deserves this, fine, but the creator deserves a degree of respect. We try to be the same about institutions too. I mean, we feel we have a great stake in the future of the city of New York. We survive along with it. While we may be very critical of what certain institutions do. We may say- 

Certain developers- 

Certain developers or anything else. We may say, that the Philharmonic has made a terrible mistake with this new program or this soloist or this piece of music. But we will not say, "What a pointless orchestra and how stupid it is that we continue to have an orchestra at Lincoln Center." 

Have you ever regretted a column you've written in terms of architecture? A critical piece and said, "I think I went too far there," or I made a mistake," or "I change my mind. 

No. Actually to be perfectly honest, when I've look back over the years, I've had almost no regrets. If they were any it's that sometimes I've been almost too fair minded I think. I have a great ... This sense of fairness that we've been talking about is something I believe very deeply, I think it's what The Times has always stood for. I think if anything, I may have bent over backwards a little too far, to try to give both sides of the question. Some questions don't have two sides. Sometimes I've sort of ... Actually, if I have any regrets and they're not a lot, they're more on that direction. 

It's clear that Frank Rich is a powerful person here. 

Sure. 

Been a guest on this show, someone I'd like to have back because I enjoy talking to him on this broadcast and admiring. Do you have to protect him? Because he does anger people, and that's his role as a critic, is to say what he says. Do you protect him in any way from-? 

Yeah, absolutely. 

How so? 

Mainly by writing what I hope are diplomatic and cordial but absolutely firm letters to people who argue, take issue with his writing. We get a lot of them. We try to answer them without yielding any ground about his critical independence. Yeah, probably of all the critics I get the most negative mail about Frank Rich- 

Because this city feels so, and there's people this city feel so intensely- 

I've got to tell you, I feel very convinced where Frank is concerned that it emerges not out of a dislike of the theater, not out of a disdain for the theater, but out of a very deep and abiding love for the theater, and a set of very high standards. In fact, I tell that to people over and over again when we do defend him. I don't mind people taking issue with specific judgments about specific plays. The letters that really drive me crazy are the ones that say, "This is a man who's out to destroy the theater." Absolutely not true. 

One last quick question about Frank Rich- 

Sure. Sure. 

A journalist like you, you understand me asking this question. People said that you two were great friends and then there was a conflict, there was something happened? 

Early on, it's true. There was a sort of hysterical event that happened, now, actually a year ago. When David Merrick took out a very vicious ad about Frank, in a page of The New York Times. It involved Frank and his present wife, who was then his fiance who was a reported at The Times. Frank was deeply upset. In fact went through a period of being very upset with just about everybody in authority at The Times, including me, for not getting the ad pulled in time to miss all editions. In fact, did miss the late edition but ran in the early edition. That's ancient history. It's long since over. In fact we worked together very happily. The most enthusiastic letters I write are the ones defending him as I just told you. 

John Simon and Norman Mailer, explain this notion of having a writer, have an opportunity to respond to a critic? 

Okay. That's something that didn't fall directly within my purview. Becky Sinkler the editor of our book review, which is one of the few autonomist sections that does not come under my purview. I actually handled that. There, I think the sense was that we were dealing with a writer of such enormous magnitude and importance to our culture that he deserved, not the consideration of an automatic favorable review, not the consideration of the chance to adjust or change a review, or anything like that, but the right of a slightly special reply. Although ultimately, of course, that really ran as an extended letter ... 

It sure did. 

Which meant that we were not really breaking our tradition, except giving him a little more space. 

Did you agree with that decision? I mean would you ... 

To do the letter? 

Yeah. 

Um, Yeah. I think it was handled the right way. I think, that to have allowed him to write a separate article as a rebuttal would have set a precedent that would have been very awkward. We run letters all the time including letters from disgruntled authors in the book review. They are rarely that long and that disgruntled, but on the other hand, you know, it's Norman Mailer. I think there was a sense that there was something legitimate he had to say. I think we handled it okay. 

You know, your first job coming out of Yale was at the New York Times. 

Yeah, I went to work for the Times Sunday magazine. 

You actually worked for them when you were at Yale, didn't you? 

I sold a couple of freelance pieces. 

And came right away working for the magazine, was it? 

Yeah. Went to work for the magazine when I got out of college. 

And pretty soon thereafter was named Architecture critic. 

A couple years later-- 

And you succeeded Ada Louise Huxtable, right? 

Right. 

And, now you're succeeding ... who was a giant in her field ... and now you're succeeding ... she'd won a Pulitzer hadn't she? Or not? 

Yes, she did. She in fact won the very first Pulitzer ever given for criticism at all. 

For criticism? 

The category of Pulitzer prizes for arts criticism was invented for Ada Louise in 1970. And, uh ... 

And now you choose to follow in the footsteps of Arthur Gayle, another giant some call a cultural maven of ... enormous power and enormous influence certainly. Not just because ... because of his job, considered a power within the community, or cultural community. You choose big shoes to fill. 

I'm not sure I actively chose them. They just kind of happened. But, Arthur is a remarkable editor. He's really an extraordinary ... 

What scares you the most about the job? I mean, what's exciting about the job, and what scares you about it, and how do you make your mark? 

What excites me is easy. First, it's great to be pedaling uphill after years of doing the same thing. Loving it passionately. I still do, which is why I still do it part-time as well. It's exciting to have a real steep learning curve and to be learning new things all the time. What frightens me is exactly the same thing; having a steep learning curve and doing new things all the time. The hardest thing actually so far, the hardest thing is actually having to come to work every day and sit in an office all day. After years of kinda just moving around the city and doing what I pleased, and as long as I met my deadlines, nobody cared whether I sat at a desk or not. Coming to work and being there from 9-7 or 8 every single night. That's exhilarating but also tough. 

There's also another dimension, which I suspect you had not experienced before. You're involved in the care and nurturing of writers. A paper is no better than it's writers. You know, and you were one of them. And now you're involved in the business of nurturing and making sure that they maximize their own talent. 

But that's a very exciting thing, actually, to learn to get your own ego-gratification through the work of other people. 

Is it hard? 

Uh, it is tough, but there's a great excitement to it at the same time. In the same way that, when you become a parent, you learn about certain things of the same sort. Also, I think it's real important ... It's the first time there's ever been a critic running that department. Most of the people over the years have been, sort of, general editors. This is the first time that the department has been run by a peer. I mean, I come from that side of the aisle. It's what I care about. I'm determined to respect the integrity. 

It's kind of like a quarterback. 

Exactly. I see myself as, sort of, a player-manager there, which is real important. 

You're writing a new book, which I'm not sure is out, on experience of architecture. 

It's not only not out, it's not finished, and this new job puts it a little farther behind. 

Would you come back and talk about architecture? I've got a lot of questions I want to ask you ... 

I'd love to. 

I love architecture and I want to talk about the buildings and walking through the city. 

If the recession gives us any more architecture, I'd love to talk about it. 

Well, I hope it will. Thank you very much Paul. 

Thank you. 

Pleasure. When we come back, we'll talk, as I said earlier, about shelters in neighborhoods in New York. Shelters for the homeless. Back in a moment. Stay with us. New York's homeless can be found in almost every city and neighborhood. Mayor Dinkins wanted to put shelters in those neighborhoods as well, but the reaction his fair share plan has been, almost, universally negative. "Not in my backyard." say residents. Joining me now to talk about it are Myrtle Whitmore, president of the Brooklyn Civic Council and (inaudible) and Sherletta McCaskill, who was homeless and is interim vice-president of the Homeless Client's Advisory Council for the Coalition for the Homeless. She's been with us before and it's good to see you back. Did I pronounce your last name right? 

It's McCaskill. 

McCaskill, okay. Tell me ... I guess I should turn to you first because of the Mayor's plan and start from there. Why is he on the right approach, by putting these shelters, if that's the right word ... 

Right. I was gonna say, first of all that's a misnomer. They are not shelters. What they are, are transitional housing facilities, and they are planned to be permanent housing facilities. And also, the right track is, pardon me. Okay, the right track is permanent affordable housing for all Americans and all New Yorkers. The issue is not the homeless, the issue is affordable housing. 

And is the Mayor, and the Mayor's plan, on the right track when he talks of putting them in a variety of communities within the city? 

Absolutely, because homeless people come from all five boroughs. They're not just strictly located in the south Bronx or they don't all come from Harlem. There are homeless people all over the city, and they have the same problems that every other community has. So, it's not isolated to just people in shelters. 

So, what do you think of the Mayor's plan? 

Well, first of all, they're not transitional housing as we understand it. Sherletta is very lovely, beautiful, she presents a lovely picture, but she's not the person that they're making this housing for. They're planning the housing for single men, from 50-200 in every neighborhood. Not women. Not families. Single men. And according to statistics, about 75% of the single homeless men either suffer with drug addiction, alcoholism or mentally ill and they're going to go, and go into stable communities and put these shelters in the middle of stable communities. Now, Charlie you know, that the homeless people who live on the streets say that they refuse to go to the shelters because they're dangerous. Now if the homeless people don't want to live in the shelters, why build more? Secondly, if they're afraid of the shelters, what do you think of people in these communities who have no control over them? They're not jails. The people can wander in and out, and that's what I'm talking about, the shelters for homeless single men. 

I would say that Ms. Whitmore is terribly misinformed. The fact of the matter is there are a total of 26,000 people in the shelters. That includes men and women. It includes families and children. 8,000 of those are single adults which includes women as well as men and the fact of the matter is is these shelters or rather transitional housing facilities are planned for that 8,000 single population. It will not just be single men that are being housed. Again, the issue is housing. First of all, homeless people, our homeless are being vilified by the media and characterized as criminals and drug addicts and so forth. The fact of the matter is that 15% to 20% of the homeless are drug or alcohol addicted and only 10% are mentally ill. That leaves a vast majority of poor, black and Hispanic Americans, New Yorkers who need affordable housing and need jobs. That's why people are homeless because they cannot afford market value rent. If you work 40 hours a week making $6.00 an hour, by the time taxes are taken out of your weekly salary, you're only bringing home $205.00 a week and that's at $6.00 an hour, not minimum wage. The issue is decent affordable housing. 

I'm not misinformed. 

The homeless are always- 

I'm not misinformed about the statistics. 

You are misinformed because these are HRA statistics. These are not my statistics. This is from the Human Resources Administration. 

No, no, the city statistics show that about 25% are alcoholics, about 35% are mentally ill. If you add them up now the plans are really Carolina, they're not for all the people in the shelters. 

We could debate statistics all night long. 

Well, it's what the man said. 

The issue is decent, affordable housing. It's not a matter of- 

This is not decent, affordable housing. 

Every single community in Manhattan whether it be the Bronx, whether is be Queens, whether it be Staten Island, all these communities share the same common problems. People in those communities have drug and alcohol problems. People in those communities have mental health problems. People in those communities need jobs and need decent, affordable housing. The issue is, you should be on our side because we're saying that we want a solution to the problem. In 10 years of shelter politics the homeless have never been consulted. The homeless are never a part of policy making or decisions. 

The taxpayers haven't been consulted either. 

We -- the shelter and so are the homeless. The homeless are also taxpayers. 

Well just a moment. May I say something? 

I'm a working person. I can't afford a rent apartment. 

May I say something? 

I want to be part of the decision making so I can have a decent, affordable house to live in and live like you. 

May I please say something? The taxpayers have never been consulted either. 

The homeless are taxpayers, and that issues has not been addressed. 

The taxpayers have not ... Just a minute. May I just-- 

Okay. We need to stop talking over each other and I'll ask ... Go ahead. 

May I just-- 

Live in the shelters and don't work. People work every day, but they cannot afford a market value apartment. 

We cannot discuss this if we're talking about different solutions. The mayor's plans- 

The solution is decent, affordable housing. 

I want you to let her finish. 

I was a public housing manager, I know what housing is. I own real estate. I know what good housing is. 

You're very lucky because you own something. 

We're talking here- 

We're talking about poor people who don't own a damn thing. We're talking about working. 

We are talking here about shelters for single men. 

Again, there are not shelters or transitional housing facility. 

It's been shelters. It's in the paper. 

If you read the literature that Mayor Dinkins commission put out himself. 

No, no. They are identified they're for single man. 

Read the literature. 

Let me stop this now and say we don't want any more to debate this notion of who they are for and who they are not. Your objection beyond that is that for the people in the communities where these shelters are proposed to be located- 

Yes. 

That the people in those communities have a right to say, "We do not want shelter for the homeless or homes for the homeless or permanent addition for the homeless in our neighborhood." 

They never said that. They never said that they wouldn't accept renovated housing, they wouldn't accept low-income housing. They said they know that the shelter plan is a failure. It has failed. Even the homeless people don't want to go into the shelters. I'm concerned- Just a moment please. I'm concerned with the taxpayers money. Why build something when even the homeless people don't want to go in? Number one. Number two, they're selecting stable communities. 

You know that the homeless would not want to go into a different kind of shelter. 

Right. Ask me and I'll let. 

You have to go by experience. The experience has been that the city does not run good shelters. You ask- 

If non-profit people were running it as Andrew Cuomo has recommended, in an invariance with the mayor's plan, it would be a better idea from your vantage point. 

For some of them. If non-profit people would run it, it might be a little better, but that is not the plan. They're going into a neighborhood like Kings Highway where you have a parking lot for where shoppers go. It's a busy shopping center. They want to take that shopping center, that parking lot, and put a homeless shelter there for 200 single men. Now, don't tell me the kind of people in the shelters. First of all, you have to separate them. The city should sit down and stop calling everybody "homeless." They should separate it into drug addicts and treat them. They should separate it into other- 

First of all- 

Wait a minute. 

Hold on a second. (inaudible) I'm going to come to a point. 

They should separate them into the mentally ill and reactivate those mental hospitals. The temporarily- 

This sounds like a lot of the ideas that I've heard Andrew Cuomo make. Do you disagree with the point she's making? 

First, I disagree. First of all because it seems that always that homeless are being blamed as the implementers of these plans and these horrible conditions that you speak of when in fact they are the victims of policy. Not once in 10 years of shelter politics have the homeless themselves been consulted. 

We have- 

Witness Mayor Cuomo or Andrew Cuomo's commission. Not one person on the commission who purports to be expert in solving the problem has a homeless. The homeless are never consulted. 

We've got a member of the city council and Jack Newfield also coming on to join us now. 

Neither are the taxpayers. 

I'm a taxpayer. 

We'll take a break and bring them in as we continue this conversation. Stay with us. Back in a moment. Joining us now to discuss the politics of homeless shelters and what really went wrong with Mayor Dinkins' fair share plan. Our New York Post columnist, Jack Newfield and city councilperson, Ronnie Eldridge. Welcome. In the time that we have, let me just rate, is the mayor's plan dead simply because you got the Cuomo commission now, which it's going to release its report, and some are saying that ... 

I don't think there's any one answer to this problem. As you can see, everybody's got a different view, and it's an enormous problem. We've only actually been talking about one segment of it which is homeless single adults. The mayor's plan it seemed to me was something put on the table to start discussion. At least that's how I looked at it. I think it's the way it's been received and then the way it's been opposed, or the way it's been interpreted. I don't think the mayor's plan never said, these are the sites. It did say, we believe in this fair share principle, which is that all communities have to share in the taking of the facilities. 

How many shelters they got depended on how they ... how many ... 

What they had as far as residential beds, offering of the services. Right. It said, "We're suggesting these sites. You come back to us in 90 days and tell us whether your community likes these sites, or do you have alternative plans or proposals?" It didn't say the city was going to run the shelters at all. In the community that I represent, we have one proposed shelter site. It happens to be a site that some people think would be viable and other people don't want it, but we're looking into it. We're visiting programs. We would never consent to having the city come in and run it. We would negotiate with them to get a voluntary agency. We would only say we want 50 people. It's a different kind of plan. It's offering small shelters. It's offering strong services, special services, and you're right. It's more or less transitional housing. It's a misnomer to call it the shelters. 

Jack, help me out. 

It wasn't a plan to begin with is really what I'm saying. 

I think the mayor made a big mistake by making only specific in his plan these 35 sites, some of which are absurd, next to public schools. The site in Norwood in the Bronx is in the middle of a shopping street. I think everything else was vague. The original survey that the plan was based on concluded that 17% of homeless adult singles are drug abusers. No expert in the world agrees with that. It was not based on testing. It was based on interviews with 202 people. The plan did not make any differentiation among different kinds of homeless people. It did not tell the communities what kind of population that they were going to get. It did not consult with the communities before the sites were put out. I think half of the sites are so idiotic and failed to take into account the fragility and importance of these working class neighborhoods in the city. People overreacted. They city council held hearings which were needlessly divisive. I think everyone fell into a trap that was set by the incompetence of Dinkins' plan. 

I don't want to defend the mayor and the mayor's plan. 

Defend the city council. 

I don't. I never defend the city council. At one point they said borough presidents, "We need to have smaller shelters. We need additional sites. Makes some suggestions." 

Everybody agrees that's a good idea. Don't they? 

Absolutely. 

Jack? 

20 years ago- 

Yes. 

20 years ago- 

No. 

No, you don't agree smaller shelters is a good idea? 

Not shelters. Let's not call them shelters. 

I disagree with the whole concept that the city is responsible for every person who comes into New York. The mayor buckled under. It was Mayor Koch. When he was taken to court and the judge said, "You have to house every person." Now, that is communism, and you know what happened in eastern Europe. 

In the neighborhood I represent, it's not communism. I think it's sensible. You talk about real estate properties. 

No, it's not, Ronnie. 

The people in the district I represent want the people off the streets. They want the people off the streets and into some kind of programs that are going to change lives. 

Why does the city have to do it? 

Who's going to do it? 

Who else is going to do it? 

Who's going to do it? Number one, they cam from somewhere. They can go somewhere else and try to find work. 

Some other city. 

Number two some other city, some other town. 

... some of the people do work that live in the shelter. First of all, the problem is not the homeless. The problem is decent, affordable housing. 

I never said that some people didn't work, Sharletta, but you know. 

The homeless have been vilified and to be criminals. 

Hold on. 

I don't think the problem is decent housing for everybody. I think the problem is we used to have lots of SROs, call them single room occupancy facilities. 

I agree. 

There were boarding houses. 

Absolutely. 

They were brownstones or tenements where a person rented out rooms and served meals. We don't have those facilities anymore because urban renewal, development in communities has replaced those facilities. 

Jack- 

We need places for people who don't want their own apartments. 

--about the plan is I think there are a lot of decent sites that are not in the middle of working class and middle class neighborhoods. There's Wards Island, Heart Island. Bryan Psychiatric Hospital has 114 acres. There's land in Suffolk and Rockland counties that's much cheaper than land. 

Let me just ask a naive question. It doesn't take a political sophisticate to know that if you talk about creating homes for the homeless in certain communities, you're going to create problems with certain taxpayers, with people in the community unless it's thought out, unless it's very carefully handled. I mean, that's obvious. 

A lot of these neighborhoods have accepted homeless shelters without this kind of fear and hysteria. If the communities are respected and consulted and involved in a decision- 

The problem here was the absence of consultation. 

You can't go to a computer and do this by census tracks and computer runs without taking common sense into the math. 

Jack, it wasn't just the presenter of the plan. It was as you said the way it was accepted. It seemed to me- 

The way it dribbled out. 60 sites, 20 sites here on Staten Island. 

This was to begin. It came out without talking to anybody. 

I resent people saying NIMBY. Anytime you say you don't want something in your neighborhood, people say, "Not in my backyard." Let me tell you something. These people work very hard for their backyard. I worked for mine for a certain quality of life, and I resent people saying that you don't have any compassion because you want a certain quality of life. 

I agree with you. I think everybody feels that way. The property owners on the west side of Manhattan feel the same way. The problem is we do have a problem. We have a lot of people who need some kind of drug treatment programs, or they need facilities for mentally ill. 

I agree with that. 

They need daycare programs. 

I agree with that. 

Councilperson. I want to give you the last word. I got 20 seconds. 

Number one issue is that the homeless are not criminals. They have bene characterized as criminals, as drug addicts, as unworthy and undeserving of help. The number one issue is there is not enough affordable units whether they be SROs or apartments, what have you. There is not enough decent, affordable housing. The homeless must have and we demand to have a seat on the policy making boards. How can you have a policy on homelessness to cure the problem when you do not consult the people? 

That's not a bad idea. Is it? Thank you all. I am unfortunately out of time. I want to thank all of tonight's guests. Tomorrow night join us again at 11:00. We'll be presenting an important follow-up to Frontline's shocking tale of child abuse in New York City. Also, Mort Zuckerman will be here. He's the publisher of U.S. News and Report. He's just back from Moscow where had an interview with Mikhail Gorbachev. Nancy Friday will be here. All of that is Tuesday's edition of Charlie Rose. See you on Tuesday.
