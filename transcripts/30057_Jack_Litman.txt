backyard." First, it was day one in the rape trail of William Kennedy Smith. There has been legal wrangling as to what evidence can be admitted, whether the jury can hear testimony from three other women who claim William Smith sexually assaulted them or testimony which goes to the sexual history of the alleged victim of the rape in Palm Beach. Here to discuss these issues and more are three of the top criminal defense attorneys in New York, Jack Litman who defended Robert Chambers in the Jennifer Levin case, Ira London who defended Joel Steinberg and David Lewis who defended Carolyn Warmus in the so-called fatal attraction case. Welcome back to each of you. We have talked before about criminal defense trials. Here we look, and the reason I want to do this tonight is that we look at the first day when some important things happened. You have a jury that has been chosen. Secondly, you have a critical decision by the judge in ruling on the admission of the testimony or at least of these three women who had given depositions in the case. Also, you have the opening statements. Let me talk first about selection of the jury. What can we say? Some are saying the defense had a major advantage because they have three so-called experts there to help them in choosing a potential jury. Does it make that much difference? Edward Bennett Williams used to say, "Just give me the first twelve." 

I don't think too many of us would take the first twelve. I'm not sure it makes a monumental difference to have experts there, but it can certainly add a little bit. Experts can pick up certain things about body language and other aspects of a personality of an individual that lawyers sometimes miss. I think it's really the sixth sense of the trial lawyer who's been there time and time again who makes the ultimate decision. 

You were there, and you were examining the witness, and you're representing the defense, Mr. Smith. What are you looking for in a juror that you want to be sitting? 

You certainly want somebody who is A of an open mind and who doesn't have a prejudice against someone who lives high up on the hill. That's definitely what you're looking for. 

Someone who doesn't hate the Kennedy's. 

It's more than just someone who doesn't hate the Kennedy's. I would assume that anyone who articulated such an overt prejudice would be long gone from the jury process, but someone who doesn't just want to see someone up on the hill and say, "That person, I want to drag him down." 

David, put your hat on the other side. You're the prosecutor. Who do you want to see on that jury? 

I think they're going to look for jurors that will believe that there is no such thing as a consent, and that a sexual act done by someone, and the victim comes in and says, "No, I didn't agree to this," that person, that juror is going to say, "If there was no agreement, then there had to be a rape." There's no black or white. You're looking for a juror if you're a prosecution who sees things in black and white and not able to tolerate ambiguity. 

Conventional wisdom is the following, that it would be better for the defense or the defense seems to be looking for older women, whatever older means and young men. 

It's not unusual in a consent issue rape case that what you want is someone who is going to look down on the victim and look down on the victims. 

And say, "Why was she there at 3:00 am on the beach?" 

Yeah. It's like, my children weren't there, or a young man who say I know why someone would be wanting to do that. You're looking for stereotypes or, if you will, prejudices that benefit you. That's one perspective. By the way, I disagree with Jack about using juror workers. I think they're invaluable, and Cat Bennett who was the principal person picking that jury, I work with, and she is brilliant. There is nobody like her. 

Why is she brilliant, and what does she bring to the table? 

She is able to discern things in the answers that give her follow up questions that when you ask those questions you open up that juror, and you're able to have the juror freely express their opinions and their views. She gives encouragement to the lawyers because we're not really eager to be open to the jurors. She opens us up to the jurors and allows them to open themselves up to us. It's an amazing process. When she helps you pick a jury, by the time you're done, you feel secure that what you've got there is the fairest group of people you're going to get. There aren't too many people like that, but there are jury workers who can do that. They help a lawyer far more than I think. 

Before I go to Ira, you disagree with that, or we have a conflict here or not? 

It's not a conflict. I told you sometimes they can be very helpful. I still say it's the sense of the trial lawyer in the end that's going to make a decision. I think a good trial lawyer knows how to open up with a jury and get conversation because this is the only opportunity you have in a trial to talk with the jury, not at a jury. 

Now that's an interesting point (inaudible). 

The legendary trial lawyers that we know of still insist that they go by instinct. Based on their track record they're usually right. What David says about Cat Bennett is true. She's a remarkable person, she has a feel for people. 

She's trained as a psychologist, is she? 

I believe she's a trained social psychologist. 

There are many like her in the country. 

She happens to be extraordinarily good, but there are several in the country. 

It still is instinctive. It's something that you get a feel for a person. 

Back to the point that Jack was talking about. What does a defense attorney want to do in terms of his demeanor with that jury of which out of that group is coming, six that are going to be sitting and listening to his or her case? 

The defense lawyer in that case has to give the feeling to the jury that he is looking for the truth in the case, that he's fair-minded, that he's not going to manipulate the witnesses in the case. 

I think the most important thing that the defense lawyer has to do in that case is to exude a sense of not only confidence but sincerity. He has to show that he believes is, I think Mr. Black is actually doing, that he believes in his client's innocence. It's very critical in this because there's an unusual aspect in this case that not too many people have talked about. As you know, in a criminal trial the defense benefits from the presumption of innocence and the burden beyond a reasonable doubt where the scales have to tip extraordinarily in one direction in order for the prosecution to convict. When you put on an affirmative case in a trial, the jurors tend to lose sight of that. What they do is they look at both stories, and they say, "Which story is more plausible, the prosecution story or the defense story?" Sometimes you run a risk of losing the burden of proof, and you simply have the jury look at a balancing test. Which side appears to be more plausible? It's the defense attorney's job to exude the kind of sincerity and confidence in his case to overcome that. 

How did Black do, well? 

I thought Black did extraordinarily well during the jury selection process, at least the little bit that I saw. 

I think he's done very well. He also projects a tremendous amount of dignity in the middle of a process that is itself dealing with some seemingly unpleasant issues. If you are able to stand above the fray, if you will, and keep your head as Roy Black has done through watching the jury selection on court TV and seeing what's being done, then you really I think project to the jury I can be a guide that you can rely on through this mess. That's really what you're trying to do. You're trying to establish yourself as a truth-teller in that room. 

Your credibility with the jury. 

It's the most important thing. 

This crucial ruling today by the judge that the deposition or the testimony of these three women who had come forward to say they had had a problem. 

Past sexual misconduct. 

That's even though there had been no criminal action, no legal proceeding. How significant is that for the defense? 

I think it was expected. If it wasn't expected, I think she would have allowed the defense to go into that in great detail with the jury in the voir dire process. It's not surprising. It certainly would be the ruling in this state by a trial judge. 

It's a major victory for the defense. 

It's a major victory, if you thought that the prosecution was going to get that in. To get that in the prosecution has to show that the pattern of conduct on the other three matters was exactly the same and matched exactly the same as the pattern of conduct that they allege in this case. 

As someone said it almost in Florida law has to be a cat burglar who always wore pink, pink whatever they said. 

It has the Jack the Ripper syndrome. It would have to be a signature type of- 

This was not true in these cases, therefore- 

Well apparently not. I mean after all, two of them, the women talked him out of it, assuming any of this ever occurred by the way. 

Yeah. 

In the third case, or the third incident, it allegedly was consummated. What I think what's most critical about this for the country and what I found very disappointing about what the judge did is that she didn't articulate a single reason for what she did. Ira: She just said- There's nothing worse than if you're a lawyer, obviously the defense is not going to quarrel with success, and rightfully so, but for the country at large, I think that people would like to have seen her to articulate reasons why she did it. Nothing worse than when you're a lawyer and you've worked hard for something and then have the judge say, "Denied," or, "Granted," without giving a reason. 

In Florida it's called the Williams role and the denial was based on the Williams role and in a sense she need not say anything more. The other thing about it is not only is it expected, but in a consent case, his prior activity sheds no more light on what has happened in some ways than what the victim's prior activity might have been. Even then, that's not an exact match, but we don't know whether this victim consented more or less based on what happened with William Kennedy Smith and some other woman. It tells us nothing about her state of mind. That's an important fact in understanding why it's excluded. If anything, if it comes in, it shows a propensity which we do not try cases on because that implies that someone who does sinning will continue to do it, thereby removing the decision from the jury. 

There is still a risk, though be it very slight, and I doubt that Roy Black is going to fall into the trap of allowing it to a curb, but there is a risk that some of this evidence may still be admissible during the trial. 

How? 

If the defense, to use the words we use as trial lawyers use, opens the door to this type of testimony. 

How could the defense do that? 

For example, if foolishly Smith gets on the witness stand and he says, "I am always extraordinarily chivalrous whenever I am with a woman. I have never raised my hand to a woman in my entire life." Let's assume he were to say something like that. Well if he were to open the door that way, then certainly I would think the prosecution would be allowed to call each one of these women to the witness stand to rebut what he said. I would doubt very much the testimony in that vein would be admitted at this trial. 

It's probably too early to tell- 

"Always," and, "Never," are the two words that his lawyer has told him every day, "Do not use." 

All right, so far, it's probably too early to tell, but do you think Smith will take the stand? 

Charlie- 

Too early. 

I wish I could give you prediction on that. I couldn't call that one. 

You have to wait until you see- 

The little bit I've heard from the opening statement, I think you could call it pretty clearly and say he's definitely going to take the witness stand. 

He is, because they view him as credible and will help his own case? 

Well I think it's not only that, I mean he got up and say, "This was an act of consensual sexual intercourse and that what happened here was an act of love between two adults who were having a good time. There was foreplay and whatever," it's going to be very difficult to prove the content of that without putting him on the witness stand. 

The problem also is that while they have a lot of expert witness and science and technical witnesses, the fact is the jury is going to look at him and if he doesn't take the stand, it's a little hard to believe that it's a consent defense if the man who can basically explain it elects not to take the stand. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the judge will explain that this should not be held against him and she's already said that in her opening instructions to the jury, that it is not a presumption of guilt or anything else. It could be read into the fact that a defendant does or does not take the stand. 

The law can't make you wiser, the law can't make fairer. It can only make you listen. 

Let me come to another question, did you see or hear the opening statements by the prosecution? Can you speak to that? 

I can speak to it. 

All right, tell me what you thought. What do you know about the opening statements? Did any of you see the opening statements by the prosecutor? What do you think the prosecution has to prove? What should the prosecution be saying to that jury? 

Well I believe- 

How would they make their case in an opening statement? 

I heard one 30 second spin on it, and apparently she was characterizing him as a very physically abusive person who turned on her, who became, to use the clichÃ©, an animal all of a sudden and forced her, physically compelled her to perform a sexual act. I think they're going to try to characterize his actions as those of someone who became very physically aggressive. That's all I got from it. 

It's hard to say. I mean there are basically two tacts that she can take. One tact is- 

This is the prosecutor? 

This is the prosecutor now, one tact is basically to say, "All right it started consensually." If she agreed to speak with him at the bar, perhaps have drinks and certainly to go back to the estate with him- 

To walk out to the beach. 

And to walk out onto the beach, but a woman obviously has autonomy over her own body and if she wants to say, "No," that has to be respected. That's one tact she can take, and I didn't get the sense of that during her opening statement. I got the sense, "He's an animal. He was very violent. He was abusive physically." 

He tackled me. He tackled her, sorry, it's tackled her. 

It's as if she's afraid to buy into the argument that women are autonomous, and I don't know why she did that, although I'm judging this as Ira did, basically on only 30 or 45 seconds worth that I read in the newspaper. 

I think Jack's dichotomy is perfect. I think that what she did from what I've seen or from what I've read on the wire copy today is that she took on much more than she needed to take on. She's now made him into this animal. Well Willy Smith walking along with John Kennedy Jr. and all of that, that's not animal sort of stuff and so the imagery that we're getting- 

Three women that are sitting there at the defense's table- 

All of them perfectly safe. 

Quickly excused the minute the jury came in. 

The women at the defense table? 

I'm sorry, I thought you meant. 

The bottom line is that she's created an image that's larger than what she needs to prove and I think the jury is seeing. She might have lost the game. They say that 80% of the jury's minds are made up in opening statements. 

Is that right? 

That's what they say. 

The conventional wisdom among- 

That's the conventional wisdom. 

Trial aficionados is that 80% of the jurors have already made of their mind. 

That's right. 

That's conventional wisdom. 

You don't buy that. 

No, certainly not in a case like this. 

I believe it. I believe it because that's the thing they hear first and that's the thing that sticks with them and that's what they match all through the trial. 

Based on everything you know, it seems that this was a good day for the defense in this case and secondly, that the prosecution has an uphill battle, is it fair to say, characterize it that way so far David? 

It was a good day for the law because what was excluded was what should have been excluded, so the defense wins and so does the prosecution if the law is upheld. It was a good day for the defense because I though Roy Black's opening statement laid the groundwork for the rest of his case and the prosecutor bit off a big chunk. She might not be able to come through. 

She may be taking a tact, I don't think it's a wash- 

She may know something we don't know. 

Well first of all she might, but she may take a tact, "Let me go this far out on a limb," and then hopefully the jury will fall in the middle so that maybe she says, by calling him an animal, maybe she'll say, she'll hope that some of the jury will say, "Well he's not an animal, but still she's autonomous and has a right to say no." If that's her tact I think it's a big mistake. 

She, in the end, the prosecution's case clearly will depend to a large extent on the testimony of the complaining witness. 

Without a doubt. 

It may very well, despite everything it said and all that we might speculate on, depend on how good a witness that person is. I read a thing about a law, the person who took the lie detector test of her who said to the defense, or one of the members of the defense team saying, "This is one, you guys have trouble because this is one very effective witness." Whether that's true or not, I don't know. 

If he testifies, the case then shifts to be ratification about his credibility as well. 

If he testifies. 

If he testifies. 

It's his credibility, not hers. 

No, her credibility is now- 

It's both. 

It becomes a balancing act, but let's not forget about the forensic evidence in this case. I think the forensic evidence may well turn out to be an important key for the jury in breaking the gaudy or not as to which side to believe because her story depend on a variety of things having occurred. For example- 

Forensic evidence is- 

How about simply- 

Clothes torn. 

That there was really a struggle, struggle, struggle and apparently there's nothing with the clothing. Now you're going to have experts, two of whom I've used as experts before who are very good witnesses who are going to testify- 

For the defense. 

For the defense. 

Thank you all. Thank you Ira, thank you Jack, thank you David. 

You're welcome. 

Maybe we'll meet again as this trial progresses. We'll be back in a moment with Paul Goldberger.
