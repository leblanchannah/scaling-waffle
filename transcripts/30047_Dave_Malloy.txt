"Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812" is the new hit Broadway musical now playing at the Imperial Theater. The musical is inspired from a passage from Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece, "War and Peace." "The New York Times" calls the great comic: "The most innovative and the best new musical to open on Broadway since Hamilton." Here's a look. (MUSIC AND SINGING) (SINGING) The great comet of 1812... The brilliant comet of 1812... (APPLAUSE) Joining me now is the writer and composer, Dave Malloy, and two of the stars of the show, Natasha -- Denee Brenton, and Pierre -- Josh Groban. Hi, guys, thanks for being on the show. So you wrote this based on a 70 page sliver -- you can say 70 pages is a sliver of "War and Peace" -- what in your mind went from the story of "War and Peace" to musical theater. How did you make that bridge? 

I really had an epiphany as I was reading the section. Like, it wasn't something that came to me years later. It was as I was reading, and specifically this section -- got to the end of the section where Pierre has this incredible moment with a comet and tears were dripping down my face. And, yes, I just had this epiphany of what I just read was a perfect musical. It was a perfect musical. It was a perfect piece of musical theater. And I think at that time I diligently went and like Googled to make sure that no one else had done it because I couldn't believe that no one else had done it because it is such a perfect story. And I loved the way that the story in particular kind of paralleled these two very different stories, this is one, you know, young romantic story, and this other like middle-aged angst philosophical story, and the way that those two ran in parallel and that they collide only at the very end, it just felt like such a musical to me. 

Tell me a little bit about the story for folks who haven't seen it, so that they can understand our whole conversation. 

Sure. So, yes, there are these two tales. So Natasha is young, which is one of the lyrics in the first song, and she is newly engaged to this man Andre, who's off fighting in the war. And so she is visiting her godmother in Moscow, and kind of being introduced to Moscow society while she's waiting for her fiancee. And while she is waiting, she meets a notorious young rogue named Anatole and then hijinks ensue. And meanwhile, an old family friend of theirs, Pierre. (CROSSTALK) 

Tell me about Pierre. What's going on with Pierre? 

Well, there's all this vanity and narcissism happening as you said in this Moscow society where there is war outside the gates and everybody is just concerned about the high society, the balls, and the opera, and all that. Pierre is searching for meaning in his life. He's, you know, he's I think a little bit of a depressive. He drinks a lot as he mentions many times in the lyrics. And he's searching for some kind of meaning after having been thrust into wealth. He's got this unexpected money. He's married somebody who he is very attracted to, but knows doesn't love him very much. And so, you know, while everybody is at war with either Napoleon or society, Pierre is at war with himself, and so there is this wonderful arc and wonderful songs that are so, so gratifying to sing as Pierre. And so, yes, I think we all see a little bit of ourselves in these characters. 

Now I didn't fact check this, but I'm guessing that you have been offered Broadway roles before. 

I have been. 

Given your success as a singer. You saw this in a sort of -- one of the incarnations, smaller incarnation -- even off-Broadway, in the West Ville in the meat packing district. What made you realize, OK, this is the one that I'm going to make the leap. I'm going to take the leap and go to Broadway. 

I was a fan of this show off-Broadway. I came to see it in the Tent Casino downtown in the meat packing district. And I walked out of there, first and foremost just totally transfixed by Dave's score. I thought this was a genre bending, complicated but beautiful score that just hit all my buttons as a muso. And then just the story felt so relevant to me. It felt relevant to me then, but it felt even more relevant now as we look at things that are going on in the world and the way we all are trapped in our own little screens, in our own little worlds and searching for meanings in our own lives now. I have been offered things in the past. But this to me seemed something unique, it seemed to me like it would be something that Broadway hasn't ever seen before. And I knew it would be a challenge to me. This is a role that is very different than the kind of person I generally am in my life. Me and Pierre have a lot of differences, some similarities, but also some differences. And so, I thought to myself, yes, this was worth the wait. I've read somewhere that they were thinking of bringing it to a proscenium and I thought, you know, what the heck, I'm going to reach out and see if it feels right. And Dave and Rachel, our wonderful director and I went out for one or five drinks and we talked it over, and it was a natural fit. Glad I waited. 

Denee, about three years ago you were just getting ready to graduate from Carnegie Melon. 

Yes. 

And you think about where you are now. Can you think about a moment or a decision you made that really steered you toward this time in your life? 

That's a really good question. Not quite to the extreme, but I had an opportunity to leave school early for a different job. And I wouldn't have been able to graduate. And I've always been a very ambitious person, so opportunities like this is where my dreams were set. And so I waited. And then the right opportunity came along where I would be able to graduate and my college also still introduced me to representation, agents and managers that would help me sort of take my steps into the industry. And I think those little decisions there really helped me get into the right rooms because as an actor, getting seen is the trick, right, getting the audition. And so I got very fortunate with the people that I got connected with in the industry. And from there, it was sort of you just kind of wait for the right opportunity and you're putting yourself out there and doing your absolute best. And a role like Natasha comes along. And I think every female at my age would kill to play a role like this. It's so complex, it's so rich. She's the archetype, she's the ingÃ©nue, and she's also dealing with coming of age as a woman for the first time in her life, which I feel very connected with her there. I feel very similarly, we were kind of dealing with these things of what it means to be a woman in our current societies and all of those things. So I feel very fortunate to get to connect with a character so deeply. And also for the material to be perfect, you know. So, yes, I think that answers your question. 

Well, I would love for people to hear your beautiful voice. Let's take a listen to a clip of Natasha sort of in one of those times in her life when she is just overcome by love, sort of laced with lust. This is Denee Benton in "The Great Comet of 1812." (SINGING) First time I heard your voice... Moonlight burst into the room... And I saw your eyes... And I saw your smile... And the world opened wide... And the world was inside of me... And I catch my breath... And I laugh and blush... And I hear guitars... You are so good for me... I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you... I love you... Dave, I'm curious about your decision about -- 

You look good in blue. 

Your decision about what this would sound like, because there are so many different kinds of sound. There's sort of like a steampunk craziness, rock 'n' roll. At one point, I was like, I went to that club. I remember that club in the '90s. And then those beautiful ballads as well. How did you decide how to balance it and what would go where? 

Totally. Honestly, I think that's one of the things that drew me to Tolstoy so much is that like, "War and Peace," it is such an all-encompassing novel, like he has the Tsar and Napolean are just characters in his novel then and he has Bellago, who is like this lowest peasant driver. And like, my approach to music is exactly the same. I grew up on '60s and '70s rock 'n' roll, and then I became a jazz snob and then I became a classical snob and then I found out about electronic music, and then I found out about like Bjork and Radiohead, so I always just included all of that in my musical palate. And so yeah in looking at "War and Peace," I said this is perfect, because I get to flex all of these muscles. I really get to do this. When Natasha is singing a love song in a Broadway musical, like that wants to feel like a real Rogers &amp; Hammerstein sort of old-school, Broadway love song, but then when they go to the club and they're all drinking vodka, it can be like raucous house music. I think that is what I loved about the book so much that it gave me the opportunity to do all these different things and to not put myself into a certain box and say, this has to be all Russian music or all folk music or all whatever it is. 

I feel like so many of the characters have their own genre almost attached to them. I feel like you've also written like so much of the electronic is for Anatole. He comes out and it becomes this, you hear the subwoofers going when he is out there. 

He is the heartthrob, right. 

Yeah. He's the one who ruins Natasha. 

He literally electrifies the room. That was actually like a dramaturgical discovery in writing the show. Originally, some of the earlier stuff had electronic music in it as well, but as I wrote more and more of it, I started to realize, oh, all of Anatole's songs are electronic. That could be a thing. So then so now his entrance he brings electronica into the room. 

With you and Rachel, you worked together and one of the things about the show that has sent critics running for their thesaurus to describe it is, because it is unusual and unique and vibrant. Was there any creative decision that you folks wanted to make. People said they can't do that. But you said we're going to do that. 

No, I mean we have been blessed with incredible producers all along the way. This show started at this very small theater, 87 seats I think it was, called Aris Nova. And you know, I immediately thought that they would shoot down the entire idea, like oh it was my first piece with them. Maybe let's do something more small and reasonable. I said "War and Peace" and they said yeah, let's do it, then our producers, Howard and Jana and many others who brought us first to the tent, they insisted that we not just transfer to a proscenium house, that we kind of keep the small intimacy that we had. And then we went to ART in Boston. That was like another step along the way and we knew if we had on our eyes on Broadway, we had to figure out how it would work in a proscenium house, but we didn't want to concede and just go, ok, we'll just do a proscenium production. It was essential to us that we keep the heart of the show in tact so we have this kind of intimacy and this kind of 360-degree surround. So then ART was a huge step in that in terms of they helped us figure out how to put this immersive show into a proscenium house. 

Sounded like people wanted to help you to be as creative as possible. 

Yeah, it was wonderful. 

Let's talk about that 360. For people who are watching this at home, I suggest go look at clips online because as being in the audience, you can be sitting on the stage or part of the show, the cast is everywhere, they are in the aisles. I'm wondering for you because your character, he is suicidal at some point. He sings in very, he is going through such an emotional thing and you're singing these songs and Lois and Rogers from Great Neck are right here. What is it like for you? They're great. What is that like for you to have to do that right in the middle of the audience? 

It made an already vulnerable new adventure for me, even more naked. Coming back into the acting world after you know leaving it kind of essentially for many years. I was at a fork in the road. Denee and I both went to Carnegie Melon University. I did take the job during my freshman year, she waited all the way to the fourth. But flexing the acting muscle again was something that I knew going to be like getting back on a bike am and I was grateful for Rachel's unbelievable guidance and direction for me. One of the things she made sure I did during rehearsals was be as uncomfortable as possible as much as possible. She placed people in the rehearsal rooms for me to make eye contact with during my songs, friends, crew members came in to help out, just to get us used to the idea that eyes were going to keep us honest at all times. And so even when there are those moments when you feel like you are throwing your heart and soul out onto the stage, you are doing it while being face to face with people. And your performance changes sometimes night by night based on the looks you get, the responses you get because you are basically telling your story both to people out in the house, you have to project, but at the same time you are telling it very cinematically to people right in front of you, so it was a terrifying endeavor to get used to that. Now I think we look forward to it, now that we have done 150 or so, we can't wait to see who is coming in from where and we can't wait to present that to them each night. 

What's that experience been like for you to be so close? 

I sort of use them as an acting cool. You know, I sort of treat them -- because Natasha's going through such a sort of, such an arc, an archetypal arc I think, and she, I kind of use them as my diary. It's funny, there are people like Anatole comes in and they are trying to send me messages not to choose him and some women are like, yeah. And it is interesting. I have at the last scene I do, it's like you're weeping. And it almost helps to have people so with you in that moment. And for me it helps with the vulnerability. You feel so exposed that those emotions that you sort of need to come up with tell the story, I find it actually helpful. I can't really imagine doing it now with just us on stage and them out there. I feel like I wouldn't understand how to tell the story because they are so a part of it. It keeps me active. 

Their energy -- 

I was going to say, one of our most clever things I think we've done is that we have managed to have a cast of 1200 people in our show, because we actually have a cast as big as Tolstoy's book, because you see the audience reacting. One of my favorite moments in the show is watching that song we just saw, "No One Else." And watching a 14-year-old girl watch you sing that song and then watching like a 70-year-old woman watch you sing that song, and they have such different life experiences. It's so beautiful. 

You really take from that, I desperately use that, especially you know, in theater you are doing the same show eight shows a week and you sort of have been given the gift of freshness because you kind of have to stay honest. 

It is the X factor. And for Pierre who sits in his study and gets to watch sometimes, it's so great for my prep going into the scenes to be able to watch the interaction, feel out what the energy of the room is each night because it is different every night. It definitely keeps you on your feet. 

I want to let the audience take a look and listen to you in the role of Pierre. Let's take a look. (SINGING) But when we fall in love, we wake up... And we are a god and angels weep... But if I die here tonight... I die in my sleep... (MUSIC) They say we are asleep until we fall in love... And I'm so ready... To wake up now... I want to wake up... Don't let me die while I'm like this... I want to wake up... God, don't let me die while I'm like this... Please let me wake up now... God, don't let me die while I'm like this... One thing that is interesting about this play, one of the many things interesting about the musical is that it has a multi-racial cast, and Denee, you have been very I think mature about this, because I think you've gotten a lot of, a lot of discussion about the fact that you are a black woman playing a Russian princess. And I follow you on Instagram. I know you really embrace this discussion of inclusion and diversity in the theater. You could have just said, I'm an actress, I'm playing a part. Why did you decide to really sort of decide to take part in this discussion? 

It's interesting. I mean, it doesn't really seem like there's another option for me. I think I'm just naturally really interested in those topics. But beside that, it's not really like a trendy topic for me. It's my livelihood, having the opportunity to be a working actor in successful shows is a right I think anyone should have if you've worked hard enough for it. And so for me I think understanding what it was like to be a 12-year-old, an 11-year-old-girl desperately wanting to be a part of these stories and not seeing myself and the toll that that took on my self-esteem and my confidence. I think having the opportunity to be in the position where I know little girls might be watching and kind of wanting to save them some of that drama and be a part of what it is like to really articulate and use the vocabulary of Euro centric beauty standards and understanding why you might feel left out of the narrative. And I think it's special, because outside of the fact that Natasha is Russian, she is an archetype of beauty and light and love and everything that a girl goes through. And I think it's important to have archetypes actually look like the every-woman. And you don't have to look like Tom Hanks to be the every-man. The every-man looks like Dave. He looks like the Asian man down the street. And so I think that was important to me. Because I think we have a power to really normalize people and kind of heal a lot of the divisions that exist in our nation, by telling the truth and representing a truthful world. And when you have Tolstoy -- I heard Dave had a dramaturgical reason for it, because every type of person is represented, every type of Russian person is represented in "War and Peace." So what does that look like in an American landscape to have every type of person represented on an American stage for our audiences? So I thought that was a really cool explanation, outside of my own personal reasons of wanting representation for women of color. There was a dramaturgical reason for it as well. 

One of the things also that is interesting to me, and I'm curious if it's had an impact on the show, is that there are a great number of people in the cast for whom this is their Broadway debut, you two, your two leads, has that had an impact on the show, on its energy? 

I feel like the energy amongst like everyone is just so happy to be there. 

We're such noobs, we're like what's tech, what's happening? 

A few of the people who have been with the show for the longest time are just old, old friends of mine who I kind of tricked into doing a show, at this little theater. They were not really actors at all. Brittain Ashford and Gelsey Bell are two women who are amazing singer/songwriters who I have known for many years. I asked them to do this show and now four or five years later they find themselves on a Broadway stage, like what, I didn't even audition for this. That sense of every one of us is so lucky to be here. 

We all had moments of real emotional, like it gets you at points you don't expect. When we first started to walk into the theater and we're seeing the set being built and we were looking up and it wasn't even polished yet and things weren't on the walls yet, and you know, Rachel would say, you know, that is mark right there, that is where you are going to sing that solo. And you just go, you look at it under construction and it hits you because I think for so many of us we've dreamed of this moment. We've been thinking about it even if our careers have taken us into, Brittain and Gelsey, myself into music and other avenues, or we've been in school or whatever it is, like the dream of having this moment has been the same for so many of us. So there isn't a moment where we don't walk out there and just have absolute gratitude for this opportunity, it's incredible. 

It would be easy to just talk about the fantastic sets and the big sounds and the amazing costumes. But my last question for you is, what is the small thing that is moving to you about this story? Because you could get just lost in the spectacle of it. There is something very emotional about this. What moves you about this story? 

Well, I mean, it is interesting, as the show has gotten everyone bigger and bigger throughout the years, we all looked at what it is now. We thought, well, this is very Tolstoy. We are very lucky especially in the realm of musical theater we get to have that spectacle and we get to give people that. But I think the core, the thing that brings tears to all of our eyes every night and hopefully audience members as well is I think the essence of what makes people happy and satisfied in their life is told through these characters in very, very different ways, but they ultimately I think by the end of it, come to the same conclusion about what it is that gives people vitality and happiness in their life. And for me, the thing that is the most powerful is for Pierre and Natasha's ending is that they are both at their absolute lowest when they finally connect after all these scenes of frivolity. And I think that that is something that I think in my own life as the circus swirls around you and you search for those meetings, we all know what that feels like to have dark moments and to search for those meanings, is to notice that that vulnerability is sometimes when you find the real path. And I think that is the main story that I take away from Pierre with the show that has always meant the most to me about the show. 

Denee, what moves you about the show? 

I think for me it's the grace that the characters offer each other at the end. It's like they make terrible decisions. And they break people's hearts and they break their own hearts and sort of at a place where forgiveness might not come easily. And even in the entirety of the book of the characters that do these terrible things, and you end up seeing their humanity. There was a talk-back with kids yesterday and they were like, it's hard because I like Natasha but she makes bad decisions, and I don't know how to feel about her, and I was like, that's kind of like life, you know? It's kind of like life and the people that you love. And the grace that they offer each other in the end and they see the humanity in each other and he reminds her that she is still worth something. That gets me every time, because you make those decisions that you think you ruined your life and someone tells you that you are still worth it and you worth another chance. I think that is just magnificent. 

One of the arcs of the show is that we do try to trick our audience. They will show a lot of the show is this big spectacle and amazing music and choreography and all these things happening. At the heart of the show is a spoken exchange between two human beings. He just says something to Natasha and she hears it. And like that is the moment that transforms their lives it is not all the other things, so that has always felt so essential to me. 

The show is "Natasha and Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812." Dave Malloy, Denee Benton, and Josh Groban, thank you so much for being here. Congratulations. 

Thank you so much. 

Thank you. 

Thanks for having us.
