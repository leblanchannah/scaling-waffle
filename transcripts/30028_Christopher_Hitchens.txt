This is one of those moments. You know what I'm talking about. Everyone has an opinion. I've heard people this week say they've set rules, are we going to talk about Trump or not? Jon Stewart retired last year, but he's back on the "Colbert" show virtually every night which is blowing away Jimmy Fallon's "Tonight Show" ratings. Who do we really need back to guide us in this, what do you call it, time. We lost writer Christopher Hitchens in 2011 to cancer, but when he was alive, no president, no monarch, politician, not even God was safe from his perfect cutting commentary, his historical wisdomizing. Hitchens was unpredictable with a rapier wit, a voice equal parts gravel and whiskey. He was a '60s socialist and an ardent supporter of the invasion of Iraq. No one wore the badge of contrarian more proudly than Christopher Hitchens. As he once explained to Charlie Rose. 

Not everyone wants to always be an awkward cuss, or out of step, or against the stream, but if you do feel the consensus doesn't speak for you, if there is something about you that makes you feel it would be worth being unpopular or marginal, for the chance to lead your own life and have a life instead of a career or job, then I can promise you it is worthwhile, yes. 

So what would Hitch say? That's right. What would Hitch say about America in this age of Donald Trump? With me are some of Hitch's many friends and colleagues. From Stanford, California, is his widow, Carol Blue Hitchens; historian Douglas Brinkley is in Austin, Texas; and here in the studio are the novelist Martin Amis; and journalist and author, Leslie Cockburn. Welcome to all of you. 

Thank you. 

Carol, let me begin with you. You memorably told me that right up until his last moments he was engaged in the news. So we can absolutely predict that he would have had something to say about what's going on right now. 

Yes, I think he probably would have something to say every time he wrote a column or every time he came on TV and, sadly, we have to try to infer what he might have said and really only he could say it. But there you go. 

Intellectual forensics, that's what we'll call it. So Douglas Brinkley, he always had a sort of historical reference that nobody else had that could create a kind of parallel. What do you think he would find as the most important or significant historical reference that would describe this time of Donald Trump? 

Well, he probably would have turned backed to George Orwell who he loved so much. And the very fact of the matter is, Orwell's books are back in circulation. One consistency of this contrarian Christopher Hitchens, our friend, was his disdain of authoritarianism in any guise. He would go after whether it's Henry Kissinger or the Catholic Church, he did not care if he smelled authoritarianism. And so I think the moves of Donald Trump to suppress journalists would drive Hitchens mad. But he would also see this as a grand opportunity, living in Washington, D.C., to lampoon Trump's, you know, speakers that are coming in, people who are on television. He would have just loved to have warred with people like Steve Bannon or Kellyanne Conway, because he knew he would be able to devastate them. Nobody could beat Hitchens in a debate. And he would have picked up, I think, the cause of the freedom of the press, anti-authoritarianism would have questioned all of Trump's seeming fascist tendencies. 

Although, because Trump is an opportunity to lambaste traditional liberalism in Washington, D.C., and because of the sort of contempt for the Clintons that Christopher Hitchens had, in the election, it's hard for me to know where he would have come down on this election. Leslie, what do you think? 

I think Christopher would have been appalled by Trump. But he also would have said, who gave us Trump? Hillary Clinton. I mean, Christopher was not, as you know, a big supporter of Hillary Clinton. 

No. 

And I feel that he would have said it's because of the way they ran that campaign that we ended up with Donald Trump. I think he would have laid a lot of responsibility at her feet. 

Liberalism infuriated Christopher it seemed to me. Just the sort of the complacent liberalism of sort of the intellectual elite drove him crazy. What do you think he would say about the people who support Donald Trump versus the people who have contempt for him? 

I think he would be very active in the resistance. I think he would sense that this was, you know, a moment that has chosen him. I think he would have more or less ignored Trump himself, and he wouldn't -- he thought Bill Clinton was a titanic vulgarian. He would have jumped out of his shoes to see Trump in his pomp. I think he would have gone for Steve Bannon. He would have honed in on Steve Bannon, who revealed himself yesterday as a semiliterate neurotic when he said, every morning President Trump tells Reince and I -- he means Reince and me -- I mean, that's a gross illiteracy. The idea of him being an intellectual is laughable. He's another neurotic windbag. 

Exactly. And I think Christopher would have said look to the language. First with Trump, the incredible poverty and paucity of his language. And, you know, his attack on the press. We remember the nattering nabobs of negativity. Well, that's what's coming out of Bannon and Trump's mouths now. So, just look to the language is what he would have said. And I think he would have learned a lot from that. And I agree with you, Martin, the idea that Bannon is the intellectual heavyweight and ideologue of this kind of supra-nationalist wing of the Republican Party is laughable. 

What would he think of Bannon as, Doug Brinkley, a kind of Robespierre, a Svengali? 

Well, he would have seen what Martin just pointed out. I mean, how many -- it's like Swiss cheese just filled with holes. I mean, Hitchens was deeply well read and a brilliant interpreter of modern life, and Bannon is sort of like Goldman Sachs hack, wannabe producer in Hollywood, who kind of stumbled upon after 9/11 this philosophy of raw American nationalism, kind of thoughtless. And, you know, Hitchens often word against established religions in general, and so, the fact of Bannon trying to play some kind of god, Donald Trump, you know, the first lady reading the Lord's Prayer at the Florida rally the other day, those are things that would have irritated Hitchens. But I do think he would have aimed for Bannon as the intellectual poser. And also, Leslie nailed it, too. There's no way Christopher Hitchens would have voted for Hillary Clinton. 

What do you think his verdict on the state of the American system would be right now? 

Well, I think a couple of things. One -- remember Christopher said the totalitarian is my enemy, not the person who tells you how to live or makes you pay taxes. It's the person who wants to control how you think. So he would be very concerned of what's happening in those Spicer press conferences. And it's coming out of Bannon and Miller and Trump himself, this sort of controlling the thought process. It goes back way before Orwell to Tom Payne who made it very clear that if you can't think, then liberty, you know, is a shadow that quits the horizon. So I think that looking at the numbers, he would have, for example on the whole Russia issue, I think he would have loved the Putin bashing, loved it, but I think he would not have bought the notion that the Russians threw the election in any way. I think he would have said that was the responsibility of the Hillary campaign. He would have looked at the numbers in Michigan, for example, he would have said, they weren't there on the ground, they didn't woo the unions, they didn't do that job. 

I think he would zero in on these threats to the press. You know, everyone knows democracy can't work without a free press. And these dark menacing remarks that Bannon and Trump have been making about the opposition party, and they said we're going to do something about it. Now, that's what would set off all the alarm bells. 

He would love being called the enemy. I mean, you see it on cable news, this sort of sanctimonious kind of like, why are you calling me the enemy, you know, kind of thing. I'm just a journalist. He would take it. He would just, oh, I'm the enemy, then? You would see that spirit come out, and that's what's really absent right now. 

He would say I am the enemy. 

I think he would think it was a badge of honor for the press to be attacked in the way that it is. The question would be could the press, in general those who cover Trump, live up to it? It's a high compliment that they're attacking the press. The question is will the press deserve it. 

And that I think is the sort of salient question for us. I mean, the press itself has a job to do. When we say, what would Hitch say, it's because we miss him. It's because we admire him. But it's also because we're asking this question of, what is the press to do in this moment? What do you think, Doug? 

Well, we had Richard Nixon, after all. And Hitchens participated in all that. He loved to gossip about the Nixon tapes and all the heinous things that Nixon said. But I think one of Christopher's most successful endeavors was calling Henry Kissinger a war criminal. That took some bravery and he stayed on it with a steady drum beat whether you agree with it or not. And he was proud of the press. You know, Hunter S, Thompson wrote a book called, The Great Shark Hunt. The shark was Richard Nixon, and the press came and went after Nixon and got him. And I think Hitchens would be proud of investigative journalists. People like Leslie, who get out there and do stories, break news, and being in Washington, D.C., and not New York, he would have been the grand poobah of the modern press corps to date. Carol and Christopher used to throw grand parties with journalists coming over to their place. It would have been a hub of how Hitchens would have looked at this Trump phenomenon going on there. Their apartment would have been. It was the salon of Washington a decade ago and it would have still been now. 

He would say look what they're doing, which is not what the press is saying right now. The press is kind of reporting. But he, I think, had that spirit and that ability to rise above and say look what they're doing. 

He would have enjoined solidarity of the press. When one journalist is shouted down by Trump, all the other journalists, I am Spartacus. They should all ask the same question. They've got to be confrontational with him because he's going to be confrontational with the press. That moment when he said, we caught them in a real beauty today, the press, and they're going to pay for it. That beauty was that the crowds weren't as big as they were for Obama at his inauguration. It wasn't a beauty. Anything -- if someone gets his son's middle name wrong, he calls it fake news. He muddies the waters. Fake news is no longer usable through ambiguity now because Trump -- for Trump, it means news I don't like. 

So, Carol, does Christopher Hitchens, do you think, know the script of how we proceed? In other words, would he look back at his knowledge of Orwell and the 20th century, and the fascists and dictators who came and went and he could quote chapter and verse like no one else, and know where we're headed like no one else? 

Well, I mean, I think you're right about that. I think he also -- because I think we know Trump doesn't really read. There're two movies that I think he would be revisiting. And I'm certainly not the first to this point out. "The Manchurian Candidate," so imagine that Angela Lansbury is Bannon, though Bannon is not half as clever as she was. And then also, "Network," which I looked at it again recently, incredibly apt, and I think he would have been drawing on some of these movie references. In "Network," the problem was just the international corporatization of the media. Now we have it with the government, with the executive branch. You know, and I think, also, he would be really attacking the so-called Republican hold-outs, you know, the guys like McCain and, before that, you know, Rubio, who disgraced himself. You know, who questioned Tillerson, who had no business becoming secretary of state, and has, you know, international commercial relations with Russia. But then rubber-stamped it. So I think he would be turning an eye to the Congress and really going after members of the Senate and the Congress as well. 

Tillerson would be a particular target, I think, of Christopher. Douglas, wrap this up for us. 

I was going to say also somebody like Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, who just doesn't understand climate change, or the fact that Christopher went down and got to be waterboarded, and it is torture Hitchens said. And now, the Trump administration shrugging their shoulders, it's not really torture, those kinds of things would have inflamed him. 

Douglas Brinkley, Carol Blue, Leslie Cockburn, and Martin Amis. What would Hitch say? I think we have an inkling and thank you so much for that. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
