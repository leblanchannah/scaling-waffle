We're back with Dr. David Hamburg. Dan Quayle, family values, the speech that he made, talk to me about family values as you see them, and what kind of debate ought we be having, and what kind of questions ought we be asking in this country? You know, with the Vice President at least opening that initiative, questions were immediately raised by some of his opponents saying, "Well, if you look at what the Bush administration did and the initiatives they've done, perhaps they haven't shown enough interest in family," but looking at it just from the kinds of questions we ought to be asking to address what I think is an important question? 

Well, I think the orientation to family values is very fundamental. I don't see that as conservative or liberal. It's a fundamentally human attribute. In my perspective, the focus is on the experience of a child growing up. What does it take to meet the fundamental requirements of being human? It so happens that human children have a long period of relative helplessness. They're vulnerable for a long time. It seems crazy from an adaptive point of view, but on the other hand what you get out of that is the opportunity to learn a fantastic amount from infancy onward, to adapt to whatever circumstances may exist over a very wide range of conditions. That's in a way what got us here in our long human history. If you're going to have that opportunity for learning, it takes protection and nurturance and guidance and stimulation and feedback, and historically, for millennia, that's come mainly from families, not entirely, but mainly from families. Now the world is changing so rapidly that we have to find ways to strengthen families to do that, to provide kids what they need to grow up intact, and also to provide some family equivalent functions beyond the family. 

Can we ever hope to do that unless we get at the question of drug addiction and crime in urban areas? 

That's a very important part of it. In that respect, Los Angeles was a wake-up call, even a kind of a code blue medical emergency. The patient is dying in that sense, the inner city, with conditions that are extremely conducive to drug abuse and violence in a way. There's a high prevalence of empty lives, of kids growing up largely alone or on the street or with immature peers without very much of the responsible, caring, adult supervision, guidance, nurturance, support that is vital for. 

Does anybody have an idea how to get at that? 

I try to spell out in the book, in the last section called Tackling the Hardest Problems, some important approaches to the extent possible based on recent research. I do think there are promising approaches, yes. 

Like? 

Like. It starts with the earliest caretakers, be it a doctor or a teacher of young children or a family member. In effect, to ask, for a child in a extreme poverty circumstance, "Does this child really have a family or something like a family?" How can you strengthen the capacity of the family members to care for the child? To the extent possible, you want to do that, and there are ways sketched out in there that can be done. Also, you almost always have to say, "How can you supplement these often smashed families with family equivalent functions outside?" For instance, the Congress of National Black Churches has a set of activities around the country that reaches out to parents of young children and supports them and helps them to give the necessary guidance and to augment what the parents themselves can do with other favorable experiences in the early years or after school hours or on Saturdays or in the summertime as kids are growing up. That's an example of support in the community of family-like functions to augment weakened families. 

What's the link with violence? What do we know about the recent studies? 

The kids joined into violent gangs in places like Los Angeles are to a certain extent, to a considerable extent, leading empty lives. They don't have much of a perception of opportunity. They don't see much hope for the future. They can earn respect and earn money, in their view, with some- 

Engaged in crime and drug-related activities. 

Right, some mixture of drugs and violence. That is really a wake-up call, because you're getting, in that sphere, just as you get in the international sphere, a kind of escalation and proliferation. By that I mean, escalation, the upping of the killing power of the weaponry being used on the streets, and by proliferation I mean lots more people able to use it. That in itself makes us want to take a prevention approach. An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure in this field. You want the kids to grow up with some perception of opportunity and some skills and some knowledge so they can make it in the mainstream economy. Otherwise, the path is to drugs and guns. 

Was there a time in which we made that turn so that we began to lose this generation, to put this generation at risk because of all these factors we talked about? 

There certainly has been some turning points, and there are ironies and even paradoxes of success. For example, the research of William Julius Wilson and his colleagues at the University of Chicago in the Chicago inner city shows that there was an awful lot of loss of jobs for low-skill workers willing to work very hard. As the Rust Belt occurred, as the steel industry declined and so on, a lot of jobs that were there that supported families in at least some decent working conditions, those jobs disappeared. Then along with that you had this paradox of success that many previously poor people entered the middle class, got opportunities, moved out of the neighborhood, so you have these smashed neighborhoods where the jobs aren't there and where successful people aren't there and the support networks that could lead kids to a mainstream economy largely have eroded. That's one big problem. 

The tax base was gone and everything. 

Tax base gone, institutions gone. 

The institutions just corroded and just fell of their own weight without those kinds of supports. 

One of the things we have to do is to find some ways to rebuild community-based organizations that can reach out to these kids and their mothers. 

This is a locker room question. Single best idea you've heard or you propose for children in the next decade. 

One of those, as good as any, we've just touched on this, actually a major study that our foundation is bringing out shortly on community-based organizations, the religious organizations, the youth organizations, the adult service organizations, what they can do to be more effective in poor communities. I think there's a great thrust there. If you put them next to the schools, you cover most of the time available for kids growing up. You could have constructive institutions, not perfect, but better than now. That's the important criteria. We've got to think about this in terms of prevention and in terms of doing better than we're doing now. 

Also, to somehow ennoble those who stand. I take note when I see in Los Angeles and everywhere else those people whose very lives, in terms of what they are doing for their children, stand as a symbol for all of us. You see those examples of people who really don't get any attention and the sacrifices they make, the leadership they gave, maybe too few of them, but there are these remarkable examples of single parents, of two-parent families, of people going out of their way, stretched to the end, but with a singular devotion to the self-esteem and the care of their children. 

Absolutely. Tremendous skill in coping with adversity. Your points really highlights the immense loss of talent that's occurring now under those terrible conditions. It makes you wonder. Let's go back a generation. How many young Einstein's were lost in the concentration camps? How many young Martin Luther King's get lost in the ghetto? 

Thank you very much, Doc. Today's Children, by Dr. David Hamburg. He's a psychiatrist, actually, by training, aren't you? 

Yes. 

He is also on the board of Stanford University still, and is passionately interested in today's children and concerned about the risk to them. When we return, journalist Donald Katz describes one
