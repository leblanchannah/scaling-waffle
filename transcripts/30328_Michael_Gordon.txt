"The New York Times" reports that under President Trump, the U.S. is becoming increasingly involved in several complex wars with no endgame. Diplomacy, meanwhile, is taking a backseat to a military-first approach. Joining me now from Washington is Michael Gordon. He is the chief military correspondent for "The New York Times" and he is the co-author of this piece, U.S. War Footprint Grows With No Endgame in Sight. How do you come to this thesis and wanted to write about it? 

Well, first of all, I was one of a team of reporters that contributed to this article. It wasn't just me and Hubbard. 

Right. 

But, you know, over the last few months just tracking the developments in the area, I was out in Iraq, I was out in Syria, it's clear that the pace of operations in the Middle East is accelerating. A lot of this follows the trajectory that President Obama set. There is not a dramatic departure in the strategy, but it's sort of an Obama strategy pumped up a bit, maybe by 20 percent. And at the same time, since I used to cover the State Department, it's rather striking that the administration is talking about slashing the State Department budget, including the kind of programs that one might want to have in place to help consolidate a military gain in Iraq or Syria. And there is very little talk on the part of the administration about what happens after Mosul and Raqqa is taken back from the Islamic State. 

What are the options as to what might happen when Mosul and Raqqa are taken back? 

Well, they are entirely different cases because in the instance of Iraq, we have an ally, the Iraqi government, and we also have the Kurds and northern Iraq, whom we work with. Mosul will be taken back. It's being taken back at enormous cost to the Iraqi military and, unfortunately, to many of the civilians there. And what I expect to happen is for American forces to stay in Iraq, not at the current level of 5,000 plus, but at some significant level, to train the Iraqi forces, to probably carry out counter-terrorism missions against the remnants of ISIS, and there also has to be a program of political reconciliation in Iraq. What happens in Syria, God knows, I mean, there is no clear Syria strategy on the part of the Trump administration. The Obama administration had a strategy that it was not very effective at executing, which was to encourage a political transition away from Assad. It had a strategy it really wasn't capable of implementing. But the Trump administration doesn't appear to have a serious strategy beyond taking Raqqa back from ISIS. 

You have said that this began under President Obama, but the president is also well known for his fear of getting dragged back into, you know, a Middle East conflict. Did he -- so where does that stand and where is that risk? 

For President Trump? 

Yes. 

Well, you know, during the campaign, when he was a candidate, Mr. Trump talked a lot about how he had a secret strategy to defeat ISIS which he couldn't reveal, then he said he would launch a major review which he, in fact, has launched, to come up with a new strategy to defeat ISIS while there doesn't appear to be a secret strategy. And the review has not yet led to any sort of announced departure in a significant way from what President Obama did. So pretty much what President Trump has done is he's continued the old Obama strategy, but he's delegated a lot of the decisions to Secretary Mattis and to his generals. So decisions are being made more quickly. Things are happening faster on the battlefield, but it is basically happening within the contours of the strategy that President Obama set. 

But is there still the risk of getting dragged into sort of deeper-involved conflicts in the Middle East? 

Well, of course, but there are all different cases. So in the instance of Iraq, we're back in. 

Right. 

I mean, President Obama failed to negotiate a SOFA agreement that would have allowed our forces to say, it wasn't his fault alone, Nouri al-Maliki shared in responsibility for that. A vacuum was created that allowed ISIS to emerge. So I think in the case of Iraq, we're not getting back out again. Nobody seems to think that would be a wise policy. In the case of Syria, we're kind of in with maybe a thousand troops or so. I don't know what the future is here because they haven't articulated a clear strategy for what happens after Raqqa's taken to help that consolidate the gains there. Then there is Yemen where the administration has stepped up the pace of operations, primarily against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and had a raid there which was less than a success. And, again, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has prospered there because there is a nasty civil war going on there that the Saudis are a big part of, and no one has really come up with a good diplomatic solution for that. So stepping back, yes, the United States is getting in deeper militarily. Some of that can't be avoided. If you want to take Raqqa and you want to take Mosul, it takes a certain amount of American firepower to make it happen. Do we want to defeat the Islamic State or not? This is just what it takes. So it's not so much that we're stepping up our military efforts alone, it's that there isn't a clear diplomatic strategy for what follows the taking back of those two cities. 

Is that because -- you wrote a big piece in "The New York Times" maybe two or three weeks ago, basically about, this president has this sort of, you know, huge respect for the military and to let the military do their thing? 

Well, I think the military -- to give the military its due, the military very well understands that once Mosul is taken back by the Iraqis, supported by American firepower and advisers, there has to be an Iraqi political resolution or else the conditions will continue in Iraq that will allow ISIS or son of ISIS to reemerge. I think the military understands that you have to consolidate your military gains with a political outcome and that any military outcome needs to be sustainable. The guy who really used to talk about that in his speeches and in his writings, until he became National Security Advisor, was General H.R. McMaster. 

Right. 

He talked about the need for a sustainable political outcome. So the military understands that. But the sustainable political outcome is something that goes beyond the capabilities of the military. This is something that has to involve the State Department, has to involve allies, it has to involve maybe treasury, some degree of economic support from the international community if not from the United States. It has to be what the military likes to call a whole of government approach. Well, that's missing at this point in time. If there is a strategy, they haven't shared it with anybody. 

And why is it missing? 

Well, I have to tell you, the Obama administration didn't have a good endgame strategy either that I ever heard for what happened in Mosul or what was to happen in Raqqa, at least not one that was remotely realistic. But I do think, in this instance, it's missing because the emphasis right now is on military action. Tillerson appears to be a bit slow to get his team together and get his strategy together and turn his attention to this. And then at the very time when the State Department efforts are most needed and when you might need programs to help pull together and consolidate a military victory, the Trump administration has come in with a plan to slash the State Department and foreign aid budget by 29 percent. It's a bit of a disconnect because some of those efforts are going to be needed to prop up whatever is achieved on the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the United States alone by any means, but the United States has to play some kind of role in doing that. 

The couple of points that you make in this piece, too, which I found interesting, number one, is that commanders in the field are given more independence to make decisions on the spot that they didn't have and used to have to wait for the thing to go up the chain of command before they could take an action that they wanted to take. The other point that interested me was the notion of in supporting foreign troops and supporting Iraqi troops or supporting troops in Yemen or supporting troops in Syria, that's putting Americans closer and closer to the front lines. Correct? 

Yeah. I mean, there are two things going on here. One is the Trump administration and the Trump White House has signaled that it does not want to be involved in managing military operations with the same degree of scrutiny that the Obama White House did. And frankly, the military used to complain quietly a bit about the Obama White House that it took weeks and months to get decisions made, like should we send three helicopters to Syria, to take an actual example. So we went from basically a micromanagement style in the Obama White House to almost a hands-off approach in the Trump White House. There has to be kind of a happy medium. So that's one thing that's going on. But the other thing is, with these very nasty urban warfare battles that are going on now, and I was in Mosul in October and November when the thing began, and these are really difficult fights. Our commanders, namely General Townsend who is the commander of the American-led task force that's fighting ISIS and his superior at CENTCOMM, General Votel, they decided just to make urban warfare work, you had to empower what they call the on-scene commander, the guy on the ground, to call in airstrikes. That actually started to happen in December under President Obama. So some of this, the centralization of authority to call in airstrikes really is not so much due to the Trump administration, it's really something that was put in place at the end of last year. And the reason it was done was because Mosul and Raqqa are such difficult fights. You just had to have the authority to call out airstrikes with the guy who's with the Iraqi forces who are trying to move forward. You can't take the time to necessarily review every airstrike with the kind of centralized scrutiny that it was done before. I mean, this approach has come under criticism because some people say it may have been a factor in the March 17th strike that led to the collapse of the building in Mosul, that led to the death of scores, if not hundreds, of Iraqis. And a review is being done now to see what really led to that. That's a very complicated scenario. Maybe the Americans had a role. Definitely Americans had a role, but it may be also that ISIS also had a role in that episode. 

ISIS is using that already in terms of how they're trying to attack the United States for its participation. 

Well, it's worse than that. According to the Pentagon, ISIS is trying to create future episodes like that by herding people into buildings. This is an allegation the Iraqis have made. But today at the Pentagon, officials were saying that they have video evidence of ISIS herding civilians at gunpoint into a building. And in fact, killing an individual who refused to go in, to keep them in that building, and then they were going to fire from that building, draw fire and let the civilians take the brunt of it. This is video that the Pentagon did not release today, but they promised to release it either tomorrow or in the near future. It will be very interesting to see what sort of evidence the Americans have on this. 

Michael, thank you for joining us. 

Thank you very much.
