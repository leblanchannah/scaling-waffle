The Final Four tips off tomorrow night in Phoenix, Arizona. The evening's first game features South Carolina against Gonzaga. The Gamecocks haven't won an NCAA tournament game in 43 years before defeating powerhouses including Duke and Florida. North Carolina takes on Oregon in the nightcap. It is UNC's 20th all-time appearance at the Final Four, the most of any program in college basketball history. Joining me now from Phoenix is Jay Bilas. He is a college basketball analyst for ESPN. And we are pleased to have him back on this program for this Final Four. Welcome, my friend. 

Great to be with you, Charlie. Thanks for having me. 

Size it up so far, as you look going into this Final Four weekend. 

Well, it's been a great tournament. A lot of chalk has advanced. But we do have a team in South Carolina that I don't think anybody expected to be here. It's funny, oftentimes, people say about the NCAA tournament, it's all about match-ups, but we knew what the match-ups were, and still nobody really thought that South Carolina could do this. They're a great defensive team, Charlie. They are physical. They make it difficult to get a straight line drive. Excellent help. They swarm to the ball. And they're a good rebounding team. But what really has carried them in this tournament has not just been their defense, their offensive execution has been much better in this tournament than it was all season long. They've not had a four-game stretch the rest of the season where they scored over 70 points in four straight games. The only time they've done that is in this tournament. And they've got a great player -- maybe the best player in the tournament if you factor in both offense and defense, has been Sindarius Stornwell of South Carolina. He's been remarkable to watch. 

Yes, but they're playing a very tough team. 

They are. Gonzaga, I think a lot of people still consider Gonzaga as a mid major team, sort of a Cinderella, but they have been this good for 20-plus years where they've knocked on the door of the Sweet 16, the Elite 8, to crack a Final Four for a long time. But I still think this is Mark Few's best team at Gonzaga because it is -- they've got major conference talent, they've got three guys that transferred in from major conference schools and they're big-time players, Nigel-Williams Goss, Jordan Matthews, and Jonathan Williams. And they got a great balance between really good guards and really good big guys. They can protect the rim. This is the best defensive team that Mark Few's ever had. And I would not be surprised. I think Gonzaga will beat South Carolina. That's how good I think this team is. I wouldn't be surprised if they won the whole thing. But I still think North Carolina is a little bit better. But this is a different Gonzaga team than we've seen in the past. 

How about Oregon? 

Oregon is really good. I thought it was improbable for Oregon to get this far, Charlie, because they lost a player named Chris Boucher, who's a 6' 11" senior, a guy from Canada, who is the leading shot blocker in the Pac-12 this year. And a guy who could step away and knock down threes and draw a big guy away from the basket. He's their third-leading scorer, second-leading rebounder, top shot blocker, lost him right before the NCAA tournament. You are kind of thinking, how can Oregon overcome that? They've done it with big-time play from two of their top scorers, Dillon Brooks and also Tyler Dorsey. Tyler Dorsey played on the Greek national team, he's from L.A., and he's averaging over 24 points per game over his last seven games. He's shooting over 60 percent from two, over 60 percent from three, and especially in this tournament, he's been absolutely magnificent. But maybe the difference maker of this team has been Jordan Bell. In the game against Kansas, he had 11 points, 13 rebounds. He blocked eight shots. While Boucher was the leading shot blocker in the Pac-12 when he got hurt, Jordan Bell is the all-time leading shot blocker in Oregon. So they replaced one shot blocker with another, but it's going to be really difficult, I think, for Oregon, going up against that massive front line of North Carolina and the way that North Carolina rebounds, especially on the offensive end. I think that's gonna be the real test for Oregon, is, can they keep North Carolina off the offensive glass and get easy second chances because that's what Carolina does better than anybody in the country. 

As I remember, you predicted the Final Four would be, before the season started, a Duke/Carolina? 

I had North Carolina in the final. I thought they were the best team when I saw them in November in Maui. I think they've proven that out. They haven't always played their best. They've had some games where they have not been good on the offensive end, maybe they didn't defend as well as they are capable of doing. And games where they've allowed themselves to be slowed down, whether it was at Georgia Tech or at Miami, or that debacle they had at Virginia where they only scored 43 points, hard to imagine them doing that. But in this tournament, they have been locked in. And they're playing without one of their best players. Kenny Williams was injured towards the end of the season. He's been lost for the year. And they're playing with a hobbled Joel Berry, their point guard. But while all the talk has been about North Carolina's inside strength -- and they are really strong with four really good big guys, and their offensive rebounding strength -- their two leading scorers are guards. Justin Jackson averages about 19 a game. And Joel Berry, their point guard, is having a great year. It's been a while, you would have to go back a ways to find a North Carolina team that was led in scoring by two guards. And now they're back in the Final Four for the second year in a row with their guards leading the way. Justin Jackson has made over 100 threes this year. That's a record. They are going to have to shoot the ball well, I think, to beat Oregon. 

I'm allowed this one question, what happened to Duke? 

You know, they had a year, Charlie, where they were injured all year. I think Duke was the most talented team coming into the year. They had the best personnel. They had the most talented roster. But for a team that had nothing but injuries early on, they never found continuity, they were never able to get sort of that high-level consistency throughout the year, I thought they found it in the ACC tournament, they won four games in four days, won the ACC championship, no team in the ACC ever won four games in four days. And I thought they would be able to carry that forward in the NCAA tournament. But they ran into a group of men in South Carolina and they got manhandled in the second half. I don't think I've ever seen any -- I can't remember a Duke team that's had 65 points scored on them in a half, let alone in the second half. Give South Carolina credit, but Duke just didn't have enough in the continuity realm to get something going toward the end of the season. They had a very nice year, but it certainly wasn't what they expected. 

What's been your favorite game of the entire March Madness? 

Boy, watching Kentucky and North Carolina -- 

Me, too. 

-- was just a tremendous basketball game. Two high-level teams and especially that last minute. Charlie, I love games in which the players decided and even though the coaches had tremendous influence, after Malik Monk hit that second three to tie the game, they had seven seconds to go and Roy Williams didn't call a time-out and let his team go down against a defense that wasn't set. And I thought it was really interesting how Luke May gets a shot that was of similar character to what Kentucky had gotten on them in the first game they played when Malik Monk got 47 points, a game winner, it was the same spot, and then it was a similar play to what Villanova had last year against North Carolina in the championship game. It's kind of funny how what goes around comes around type of thing, or I don't know if you call it parallel, but it was really interesting to watch, and what a fun basketball game in that Elite 8 game. 

But he had pretty much a clear shot there, did he not? 

He did. Luke May made a really intelligent decision to kind of back up and get to the three-point line even though his toe was on it, and then Theo Pinson drove the ball and made a great pass to him. It was wonderful to see a player like Luke may decide the game where, you know, his game against Butler and then followed up against Kentucky, those two games, he scored 33 points. He shot over 60 percent from the field over 60 percent from 3. And the hero is in class at 8:00 the next morning. Pretty cool. 

Frank Mason of Kansas named player of the year by the AP. Is that a consensus choice? 

Yes. You know, there are other players that were worthy of that honor but nobody had played as well, as consistently, at a high level as Frank Mason. You know, to average over 20 points a game in the Big 12, over five assists, and shot near 50 percent from 3, and he didn't take a game off, didn't take a play off. That is one tough basketball player that was supposed to go to Townsend out of high school, winds up at Kansas, and, I guess an improbable story to wind up as player of the year, but I can't think of anybody more deserving. There's got to be a place in the NBA for Frank Mason. I think he's gonna play in that league for a long time. That's how good and how tough he is. 

Jay, thank you for joining us, it's always a pleasure. 

Thanks for having me, Charlie. Great to be with you.
