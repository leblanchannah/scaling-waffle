Philip Gorski is here. He is a professor of sociology and religious studies at Yale. His new book is called "American Covenant: A History of Civil Religion from the Puritans to the Present." David Brooks, the "New York Times" columnist, calls it, essential reading for this moment. I am pleased to have Philip Gorski at this table. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

Tell me what -- this is a story, some say, of a struggle between two traditions. 

It's a struggle between even three rival traditions for thinking about the meaning of the American project. On the one hand -- 

What do you mean by the American project? 

What do I mean by the American project? 

Yes. 

That's exactly what's at issue. And so three different visions, one that sees the United States as a Christian nation, another that sees it as a secular democracy, and a third, the one I'm defending here, which sees it as a combination of sacred and secular values. 

And this is, as you have certainly pointed out, this is not like a third way. This is different than the conversation that took place at the time, you know, certainly in Britain, the coming of Tony Blair, and somewhat in terms of the political direction that Bill Clinton took in America. 

Yes, I don't think it's a third way. I think it has been the central way along which the American project has proceeded really for most of our history, and I don't think that it's just a mushy middle, you know, an averaging out of two different positions, but it's a position that has its kind of own logic and coherence. 

Tell me about, first, religious nationalism. 

Well, religious nationalism is the idea that to be a full citizen of a particular nation, you have to belong to a certain religion. In the case of the United States, that typically has meant Christian nationalism, though some accommodations have been made for other faith. And most religious nationalisms, including American religious nationalism, tend to think about history as a cosmic struggle between forces of good and evil and they place the nation on the side of the good; and its opponents, internal and external, on the side of evil. In other words, they think that the line between good and evil runs between people in groups rather than running through them. 

And how much did they take that from their own religion? 

It's interesting. I think that these are features that you find in religious nationals and really throughout the world in very different traditions. But when you're thinking about Christian nationalism as is developed within the United States, I think the key sources really have been two. One is apocalypticism, belief in the end of the world and a very literal interpretation of how that's going to happen. A very literal interpretation of the Book of Revelation, in particular, but it also draws on the Jewish scriptures, in particular on the idea of a conquest of Canaan, that the nation has to struggle against its enemy, that blood has to be shed, has to be sacrificed to an angry god. 

OK, but that's not all of Christianity. 

Absolutely not. I think that's the dark side of Christianity. 

So you think that religious nationalism is the dark side of Christianity? 

I do, I do. And I think one of the big messages that I'm really trying to get across in this book is to help secular people understand that religion doesn't poison everything -- as the late Christopher Hitchens once said -- any more than secularism purifies everything. I want to help people understand that there is darkness and light in both secularism and in religion. 

When you talk about secularism and secular democracy, what are we talking about? 

I think there is a kind of secularism which is perfectly reasonable in which almost all Americans accept that we characterize with the phrase separation of church and state. I think most of us recognize that too much mixing between church and state is not good for the state and it's not good for the church either and we, for the most part, respect that. When I say radical secularism, what I mean is a much more combative position than that. A little bit like what I just described as this idea of religion poisons everything and secularism cleanses everything, and that what you have to do is you have to create this hermetically sealed barrier around our public life and you can't let any religious symbols, any religious talk, any religious values into them without polluting the public square -- 

But you don't believe that? 

I don't believe that. I think that that is -- leaves behind much of the best of our traditions. 

What makes America? Is it this that we're talking about? 

There is a good kind of American exceptionalism and a bad kind of American exceptionalism and the bad kind is the United States is completely unique and above all other nations. It's without sin, without blemish, and the problem with this kind of exceptionalism is it refuses to face up to the mistakes, the transgressions, the bad things that are a part of our past. There is another kind of American exceptionalism, though it's not usually called that, which I'm completely happy to affirm and which I think many Americans affirm, and that is the idea that this is a unique experiment in democracy, an attempt to make a nation of nation and a people of people. This is something which many political philosophers historically thought would be impossible. That you could only have a republican form of self-government and have a homogeneous population. 

Is this because of the genius of the founders or were they not -- they were, yes, geniuses, but imperfect geniuses. 

Absolutely. I'm happy to agree with you on that point. They were imperfect geniuses for sure 

But they had a sure sense of the purpose of the nation that they wanted to establish. 

I think that they did and I think that you can find in a way that they thought about the nation something like this tradition that I'm talking about here. I think one of the most interesting discoveries that I made in writing and researching the book was the importance of the idea of a Hebrew republic. This is the idea that monarchy actually was not given to the Israelites as a gift but was given to them as a curse. Why given to them as a curse? Because it conduces to idolatry. It's the kind of a government that befits a corrupt people and not a virtuous people. And the founders thought that Republican self-government was the kind of government that suited a virtuous people, though they knew that virtue was fragile. Benjamin Franklin's famous remark leaving the Constitutional Convention, What kind of government do we have, sir? Republic, if you can keep it. 

Are we doing something so that the commitment to the betterment of the nation is hard to step forward to do, a, because of the way it is, the nature and the nastiness of what goes on, and secondly, because it is such an invasion of self? 

I think that has dissuaded a lot of people from going into national politics. I think the hopeful finds that I see are re-engagement of folks on the local level. 

Yes. 

I see actually quite a bit of that. You know, I've never seen as much local activism in my lifetime as I've seen in recent months, and that to me, is a very hopeful sign. 

I'll tell you another hopeful sign, according to what I have been told, millennials have a higher sense of service, a higher sense of wanting to be engaged in some public way, than the generation before them. You would know that because you're on a university campus. 

Yes, that's my experience, too. I think in sort of an ironic way that the financial crisis of 2008 and the economic fallout of it has made some of them really reassess and think about whether, you know, making a career and making money are really the only or even the most important things to be pursued in life. I think many of them for this reason are really determined to do something that contributes for the greater good. 

Thank you for coming. 

Thank you so much for having me.
