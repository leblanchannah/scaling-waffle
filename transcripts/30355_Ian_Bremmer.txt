It has been a benchmark week in the Trump presidency, the confirmation of his nominee to the Supreme Court, a key summit meeting with the president of China, and in a major policy shift Thursday, President Trump ordered a military strike on a government air base in northern Syria. 59 cruise missiles targeted Syrian warplanes and facilities implicated in Tuesday's deadly sarin gas attack on civilians. With me now is Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. He recently returned from the region. Welcome back to this program. 

Thank you, Charlie. Good to see you. 

Set out for me where you think this is, what did it accomplish, and what are the risks? 

What it accomplished by far, it's the most significant foreign policy move that's been lauded both domestically and internationally for Trump since he became president, right? I mean, the entire foreign policy establishment to the United States, many of which was "Never Trump," both Democrat and Republican now coming out full-throated support for what Trump did. Also, allies around the world: Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Germany, the U.K., Canada, these are folks that have all been unnerved in various degrees with things about the Trump administration coming in and they're now all together saying we're glad he did this, so that's clearly a plus. 

The possible exceptions are China, Russia, Syria, and obviously Iran. 

Obviously Iran, yes. That's basically it. So Russia being the big one because people expected and Trump expected he would be able to develop a better relationship with Russia. That's clearly well off the table right now. And the potential for real confrontation between those two is significant. But Tillerson is still going to Moscow in a week and the Russians could have canceled that meeting. They chose not to. So clearly, they are also being tempered in the way they want to respond to all of this. The question is what has he accomplished aside from getting support for this one-off act. In terms of the war in Syria, he has accomplished very little because this isn't going to change the way Assad behaves, it isn't going to change Russian or Iranian support for the Syrian regime. 

What would change the way he behaves? 

Well, I mean, a threat to Assad's well being. 

Political survival and physical health. 

Yes, and I mean, so either talking about a threat of a decapitation attack against Syria and Assad, which is something that given the territory he's taken and given his support from the Russians and Iranians, he feels quite confident that's not coming, or if he felt the diplomatic process being led by the Russians suddenly really had the potential of throwing him under the bus. There is no reason to believe that the Russians are prepared to do that. 

A lot of people said that Barack Obama at every turn resisted doing this. I guess we'll now find out whether it was a correct decision by Donald Trump. 

Yes, we will, but we won't find out for a while. You know, Obama agonized over this decision and ultimately he decided not to take it, not because he thought there was a problem with the pinpoint strikes, but because he didn't know where we were going to go from there. Now, Trump, I think, did not look any further than the strikes, right? I mean, he got the advice on what can I do to respond to these abomination of chemical attacks against these civilians, against these children, and he was able to come up with something that looks really good in the near term, but then what do we do? He has said in the last 48 hours that we want a transition in the near term from Assad. And he also said that these photos affected him. Now, in the next few weeks, we're gonna see more photos of kids dead. And the next few weeks, there is no move towards a transition away from Assad. So, the ball is actually still very firmly in Trump's court, unless he wants to be left with continued failure -- 

What are his options? 

Well, I think one is the slippery slope that Obama wanted to avoid. It's more military engagement which doesn't come just against Assad with the risks to American soldiers' lives on the line, but also comes with the Russians and Iranians supporting them, and the potential for direct confrontation with a Russian plane, with Iranians getting killed on the ground, obviously those are vastly more significant steps. 

And vastly more likely because the Russians have pulled out of the agreement. 

Between the Americans and the Russians in terms of deconflicting the air force on both sides. 

That's right. 

Yes, in the other words, the Russians have made clear that while Trump can get away with this, they want to make it costly and quite risky for Trump to take further escalatory steps against the Syrian regime. There is clearly no willingness at this point for the Russians to throw Assad under the bus. 

Does Vladimir Putin really want a confrontation with Donald Trump? 

No, but I think he wants to embarrass Donald Trump. I think that Putin really believed, and certainly he was advised as such by many Kremlin officials, some of which are no longer with us, that if Trump became president, that the relationship with Russia would be noticeably better. And that's one of the reasons, the primary reason that Putin decided not to go ahead with sanctions or steps against the U.S. when Obama took those sanctions for the DNC hacks. Now, Trump is now president. The relationship is not improving. In fact, it's deteriorating faster. And at the very least, Putin has a whole bunch of information from hacks on the Republican National Committee that never were released. Well, I suspect we're probably going to start seeing some of that information. I think there are a lot of things that Russia can do -- 

They'll funnel it through WikiLeaks? 

WikiLeaks or other sources, but I mean, it's hard for me to imagine that Trump, with all of his domestic vulnerability around the ongoing FBI investigation of collusion between suspected Trump officials, those advising him and the Russians, if the Russians have information that can further embarrass Trump, I suspect some of that's going to start coming out. 

But I suspect also that the CIA had lots of information that will embarrass Vladimir Putin. 

I'm sure that's true but how vulnerable is Putin to that domestically? I would argue virtually not at all. I think -- again, we see how Obama was unwilling to go that route. Despite the fact that the elections were delegitimized by Putin, he clearly could have put out information against Putin showing money, showing, you know, sort of compromising political information with key allies. He chose not to do that because it would have escalated in a way that doesn't necessarily hurt Putin, it just angers him. And I think that Trump is gonna be up against the same thing. The Kompromat and propaganda organization that the Kremlin has is a hell of a lot stronger than anything the United States could put into play. 

It is, but the CIA knows how to find secrets. 

Sure, absolutely. 

They have lots of sources and means to figure out everything there is bad to know. 

But your point is that we are moving back towards a Cold War. 

No, I'm asking is that your point? 

I think that -- well, the Russians don't have the same economic capabilities, they don't have the same political reach they used to, but I do think the level of confrontation between the U.S. and Russia, the perception of zero sumness, that if we win they lose and vice versa, in Russia's extended backyard, including European elections, including things like Libya, and Yemen, and Syria, that that is becoming real. 

What also is becoming real, as we know, that the FBI has acknowledged there is an ongoing investigation to look whether there was any collusion between Russians and Trump operatives. 

Exactly, and that's one of the most interesting things here is the fact that, you know, in the near term, Democrats and Republicans are going to be talking less about Trump colluding with the Russians because he's now on the right side, "the right side" of the Russian issue. Lindsey Graham, John McCain, supporting very strongly what Trump is doing against the Russians in Syria, but that doesn't change the FBI investigation, which is going to continue at its own pace. That's going to come out, the media is going to be following it, and the Russians are now an increasingly interested player, not very cooperative with Trump. 

How do you think the Chinese view this? 

I think the Chinese are both surprised and annoyed that while they were meeting -- came all the way over to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump, that this announcement was dropped upon them, so, as a consequence, you know, the importance, the pomp of that meeting is seconded effectively to this. Clearly, they also have been more aligned with the Russians. They've supported virtually all of the Russian vetoes at the security council when other countries, none of the other permanent members did. So I'm not surprised that the Chinese would be on the Russian and the Iranian side on this issue. They're not gonna sort of go to the mat on Syria the way they would on Taiwan or North Korea. 

But there is a question also though, it sends a message that Trump when he threatens North Korea saying if the Chinese are not gonna help, we may go it alone. The Chinese might say, well, you know what, he's serious. 

That's right, and I actually think that was in some ways the most useful thing that came out of this entire episode for Trump is the fact that he showed a level of unpredictability to the Chinese and makes the Chinese now think, you know, we may need to give a little to get a little on North Korea. But, still, what Trump has shown so far is that when he goes to the negotiating table, he's really all about the stick, he's not about the carrot. And while the Chinese might be more willing to accept that, the North Koreans probably are not. Keep in mind that Kim Jong-un just had assassinated his half brother who was under the protection of the Chinese government. Now, someone doing -- willing to do that, when the Chinese are responsible for 90 percent of your economy, is not someone that is easily going to be cowed by threats of a strategic, of a surgical strike. I mean, this was also a guy that was willing to launch a ballistic missile literally as Xi Jinping was on his way halfway around the world to come and visit with Donald Trump. So his willingness to put himself on the map and to potentially embarrass the Chinese is actually quite significant. I'm hoping that the people who advise Trump are giving him some of that information, some of that input. 

The summit is now over. What has it accomplished? Do you know? 

I think that the summit, so many people in the media believed the summit was going to be negative, that Trump was saying the Chinese are raping us on trade. The fact that we ended up talking about Syria and that Trump was the aggressor, Trump was the actor, he was the one making decisions, makes Xi Jinping not look like he's calling the shots. For the last two, three months, everyone, including you and me, have been talking about how Xi Jinping is the one that' sable to make up more ground in the international environment. TPP, the trade agreement, didn't get done, the Chinese are the ones spending the money. Now suddenly the Americans are actually making the news. I think that helps, it helps reset, creates some balance, it also creates a little bit of diplomatic space, the two great men have now met each other. Now, the people, the professionals underneath them can spend some time maybe working through, can there be some cooperation on some of these issues without the hot glare of the klieg lights, you know, sort of focusing on the body language. Was there a good handshake? All the things that the media would have torn apart in the next week, they're not doing that, and if Trump can avoid tweeting about China and about saying that the Chinese have to pay more and the rest instead can focus on Syria the next couple of days -- 

Maybe he Tweets and says I just love Xi Jinping. 

That would be awesome. We just need to get away from the I need to be a tough guy. He proved his tough bone a few days, very masculine, bombing Assad. 

That's a good thing I suspect. 

Exactly. 

They know that he's prepared to engage if he thinks it's necessary. 

I think the biggest plus that comes out of this entire episode is actually U.S.-China, not Syria or Russia. 

The other interesting thing, though, is that they seem to have done it well in terms of whether it was proportionate, number one. 

Yes. 

Number two, the military and the people that he trusts in the military were there for the decision-making. 

Yes. 

It was handled reasonably quick. 

Yes. 

It was, as I said, proportionate. 

And they told the Russians -- 

And they told the Russians. 

-- in advance, you know. And the fact that he didn't go to Congress, I have no problem with that. They go to Congress, you have a vote, the Syrians are prepared, they move their stuff away. I mean, here, it's definitive, you respond, that's that. I actually think the people who are criticizing him for not taking the time to go for a vote, that's an ill-founded criticism. I think the actual process here. 

But is it right, though? Whether it's ill-founded or not, I mean, should we have the executive office go to the legislative under some separation of powers to get permission when they are going to engage in these kinds of military actions, invading another country, so to speak, in terms of an attack on one of their airports? 

The legal definition of whether American national security is at stake and therefore whether you need a congressional vote is nebulous. Many other presidents used that to their advantage. I think given the extraordinary issues that Trump was under, I wouldn't worry about that one. 

Barack Obama was going to go to Congress. 

But not on Libya. 

No, he's gonna go on Syria. 

On Syria, right. 

And right after, right after, the British have basically, their parliament had said no. 

Yes, but not many analysts of Obama believe that he was going to do that if the Brits had actually voted in his favor, it was only when -- So again, it's hard for me to point the finger on Trump on that issue. And your point which is that the process actually went well. So many things about Trump have been, oh, my God, this process is a dumpster fire. We have no idea if this guy who's unfit for office can actually make a decision with his fingers on the button. Well, this is the first time we've seen his finger on an actual military button, something that is a significant escalation and, actually, thank God, he handled it okay. 

On balance, do you think this was a smart action by the president or remains to be seen? 

I think that if the United States had not responded to these chemical weapons strikes by Assad, no one else was going to do so, no one. And that is a very good reason to bomb, and it's also a very good reason not to bomb. 

That is also testament to the idea that, still, there are a lot of people around the world want America to lead. 

There is no question. And the willingness of America to actually lead on this issue, we perhaps may have induced Assad to think a little more carefully before the next chemical weapons attack. We've already seen that Assad has launched, since those strikes, more attacks against Syrian civilians. We haven't changed the outcome of the war, we're still going to see more kids dying. Trump isn't accepting Syrian refugees. Trump doesn't want the Syrian kids here. He's planning on cutting back on foreign aid. Now, if Trump decides he's gonna change his mind on some of those things, you and I can sit down and have a different conversation. But for now, most of Trump's "America First" is firmly in place. 

Ian Bremmer, thank you for coming. Back in a moment. Stay with us.
