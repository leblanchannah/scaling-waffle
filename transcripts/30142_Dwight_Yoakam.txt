Grammy Award-winning country music artist Dwight Yoakam is one of the most influential singer-songwriters of his generation. He burst onto the scene in 1984 with a brand of music that was true to the honky-tonk roots of country, influenced by artists like Hank Williams and Buck Owens. Now, in what Newsweek magazine called an ''image-breaking'' performance, Yoakam has turned to acting. He is earning strong reviews for his performance as an abusive alcoholic in the film Sling Blade. (sp? ) I am pleased to have him on this broadcast this evening. Welcome. DWIGHT YOAKAM, Singer/Songwriter, Actor: Thank you. It's nice to have you here. 

It's a pleasure to be here. 

As you reminded me when you sat down, a long time ago-- 

Yeah. 

--on the CBS overnight broadcast-- 

Via satellite. 

--called Nightwatch, via satellite-- 

Yeah. 

--you stole one of my mugs. 

That's right. 

But it's great to have you here. 

Different logo. This one's-- this one's logo-less. 

Yeah. That's right. Well, we're-- 

It's good. 

We're going to get there one day. We'll have one of these logos one day. Acting. 

Uh-huh. 

I mean, you had this stuff in the back of your mind for a while or just-- 

I did it when I was-- 

Yeah. 

I actually-- the first real working band that I ever was able to form and perform with was an outgrowth of a high school theater program that I was in and I-- and I-- the instrumental music department biannually would do a variety show, every other spring, instead of a spring musical, and I was involved heavily in the theater department and this gentleman, Charles Lewis, (sp? ) who ran the theater department at Northam (sp? ) High School was very influential in my life, as a performer. He demanded an enormous amount of professionalism. We weren't doing anything that was necessarily heady, in terms of the material, but he ran a summer stock company-- 

Yeah. 

--so he brought that kind of ethic, you know, to that high school program. And in this particular show, a bunch of guys from the stage band said they wanted to do some kind of a rockabilly thing. This was in probably '72 and the nostalgia had kicked for the late '50s. And I had grown up listening to-- and trying desperately to fit in, moving from Kentucky to Ohio, to have an affinity to some kind of rock-and-roll music, you know, because what I listened to was bluegrass, mountain music, and my parents' music, you know, ,Stonewall Jackson, the early Johnny Cash stuff, and then Orbison-- 

Yeah. 

--you know, the Everlys, all those things. 

Me, too. 

But by the late '60s, had lost kind of a touchstone, more than anything. It was-- so they asked-- they heard I sang and they said, you know-- but this again was all alone and by my-- at home. Nobody knew. And so I said, ''Yeah. Well, okay. Well, I'll come in,'' because I played drums also, at the time. We put this band together and it was a rockabilly act that I took the last two years of my high school and toured-- and one we played around town with-- 

Yeah. 

--and played-- then I later on went into clubs with. And I was doing Buddy Holly stuff and that extension of that kind of hillbilly music that-- that connected rock-and-roll, you know, to-- 

But were you always, at that time, thinking about the roots and ''Maybe, maybe, maybe I'm going to get back into this-- this other thing''? 

The acting? 

Yeah. 

I made a conscious decision. I went to California. I'd gone to Nashville for a time after I dropped out of Ohio State. It was a real checkered kind of past there at Ohio State. But I-- a quarter of school, then a quarter out, a quarter in-- and I left, went to Nashville and didn't find an environment, at the time -- this was probably 1976, '77 -- that was conducive to what I felt would allow me to evolve as a writer. I'd written, but not a lot, at that point. I was just trying to-- groping around, trying to define myself. And it was suggested that California and L.A., in particular, might have an environment, in terms of live performance, that would be conducive to me doing this kind of to them, at the time, country rock. Now, it was-- it had elements of that real base mountain music and bluegrass. And I was still toying with-- I did-- I did a couple of plays in a playhouse after I got to California, still wanting to perform, to express myself that way. But I realized very quickly that you don't control your own destiny at all, as an actor, you know, just on the street, you know, begging agents to talk to you and, you know, handing out pictures and-- I decided after-- after the play -- I did a play in '78 in Long Beach, at the Long Beach Playhouse -- that I controlled my destiny with my music, to what degree that we can. So I focused solely on that and at 20-- I think I was 20 or 21, by that point, and I-- I just-- I mean, I thought that if I succeed as a performer, expressing myself musically, that there may be an opportunity to at least do theater again, which-- which I then-- I did for the first time three years ago. I did a play in L.A. at the Met (sp? ) Theater, directed by Peter Fonda and co-starring Sally Kirkland and-- 

Yeah. 

--it was a Southern piece called-- it was Southern Rapture. It was kind of a Southern Gothic. 

How did you get to Sling Blade? 

Actually, through music, because Billy Bob Thornton, who wrote, directed and stars in it-- 

A legend in his own time. 

A legend in-- yeah, in a lot of circles a legend. Yeah, he is a legend in his own time, truly. He saw me performing in a nightclub in L.A. He was stumbling around about the same time I was, as an actor-- well, I was stumbling around, finding myself musically-- and saw me play, I think, the Palomino Club in North Hollywood out there. And he told a friend at the time, he said, ''That-- don't-- don't ask me why. I just think this guy is going to express himself as an actor at some point.'' So years later, he saw me in a film that I did for Showtime called Roswell, about the UFO incident in 1947, and he said that that, you know, confirmed for him his-- his original thought and instinct on-- on me as a performer. And so he came to me with this character in mind and he said, ''I'm writing this now and''-- I saw the short. I had seen One False Move, so I was very taken by his writing and his acting. 

Yeah. 

But-- 

It's a great movie. 

Yeah. Terrific, I mean, because it-- 

Not great, but it was a very good movie. 

But-- yeah. It really-- 

Told a story well. 

Well, yeah, and as I said earlier, what-- you-- (unintelligible) genre has been done and it's not-- there's-- there's not a very deep amount of topsoil to-- 

Exactly. 

--you know, to-- you kind of-- 

To plow. 

To plow. Yeah. Exactly. (crosstalk) --to hoe in. But you know, I'm out there with a hoe. (unintelligible) plow. And so I think he-- you know, he-- (crosstalk) He grew a lot of crops on that little bit of ground. Huh? 

Yeah. Franklin directed that, didn't he? 

Yes. Yes. Carl Franklin-- 

Carl Franklin. 

--directed. 

Yeah. 

And I then saw-- I saw the short that was the outgrowth of his original one-man stage play-- 

Yeah. Right. 

--called-- titled Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade-- 

Right. 

--and I was just blown away. 

All right. Your character in this film is what? Is who? 

Well, you know, I guess superficial glance is he's the-- he's the-- he's the antagonist. He's a bully. 

Right. 

But with Billy Bob Thornton writing something, that's not where it-- 

Yeah. 

You know, it doesn't-- as it didn't end in One False Move with him in there in the-- 

Okay. Here's you character, Doyle Hargraves, (sp? ) speaking with Frank, who is Lucas Black, (sp? ) and Carl, who is the infamous Billy Bob. Take a look at this-- Sling Blade. 

So Carl, come over here and sit down. Talk to me. 

Come on, Carl. Let's go in the garage. 

God damn it, I want to talk to him. You sit down, Carl. So what's in your bag? 

Oh, this and that, toothpaste and whatnot. 

What's all them books? 

Different ones. One of them's the Bible. 

You believe in the Bible, do you, Carl? 

Yes, sir, a good deal of it and-- I can't understand all of it. 

Yeah, well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat that one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and lo and behold, someone saith to someone or another. Just how retarded are you? 

Stop it, Doyle! 

Frankie, you be quiet. We're talking. The adults are talking. So was you in the lock-up for cutting someone up with a hatchet or something? 

I ain't never used no hatched that I remember. 

So you're just crazy in a retard kind of way, then, huh? Oh, I'm just kidding you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. 

Yeah. While we were watching that, we were talking about Red Rock West. You said-- 

Yeah. John Dahl, who wrote and directed that-- he wrote it with his brother, Rick-- 

It just got lost. 

Yeah, it got lost. Exactly. It fell through the cracks and I was saying I had the fortune to meet him at the Chicago Film Festival. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel found it, so to speak, and resurrected it and-- and they've done that for several movies. It was One False Move it also happened that they-- they-- 

Found it. 

--found it after it was dismissed or not released and said, ''Wow. Here's something we all missed.'' And then resurrected it. Red Rock West ended up in theaters because of that, after the fact. 

Yeah. I mean, I remember-- it was on video. I went and got it on video-- 

Right. 

--before it hit the theaters. 

Right. And it came then on theater, yeah-- 

Yeah. 

--because they ended up-- they just sold it to HBO. They-- they short sold it. I mean, the people that were involved with it-- I mean, I don't mean the marketing people, the people with the-- whoever financed and produced it didn't understand it, I don't think. They didn't-- they-- you know, they-- what was it, they overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose. 

Yeah. Do you have any sense of what you want to do and how you want to do it? I mean, are you-- do you just look to the music for self-expression, you look to the films as an opportunity to do-- another way to express yourself and-- and depending on-- 

Yeah, as a way to leave myself, again, on-- in a superficial sense. 

Yeah. 

I mean, ultimately, you end up into yourself-- 

Yeah. 

--even deeper, but-- but what I want to do? Is that what you-- 

Yeah. 

I'm not certain. I know that I'll never quit doing the music because the music is such a-- such a means to access-- 

Yeah. 

--myself on such a personal level. I'll never, ever be able to quit doing that. And it's-- it's such a catharsis for me, you know? It's just always been that, you know? I-- 

Where is the center of country and Western music today? Is it still Nashville? 

Yeah. 

It'll never leave Nashville because-- 

I don't think-- 

--the power's there? 

Cultural-- well, culturally, too. 

Culturally. 

I think-- yeah, it-- yeah, I don't think it's-- yeah, culturally. I don't think that it'll leave because it is, thank goodness, still, to some degree, identifiable as a colloquial art form and expression. 

Yeah. 

And it's cyclic. I think, it-- you know, it ebbs and flows. It got huge two or three years ago. It was the form of pop music in this country. 

Yeah. 

That's kind of-- that's (unintelligible) again, I think it's natural. And in the last 12 years that I've been able to make a living doing it, I've seen it, you know, go through a couple different cycles (unintelligible) you know? And I think it-- that's just natural for it. I don't think it'll ever leave Nashville, you know? I don't think the film business will really ever-- they-- as much as they try to-- (crosstalk) Now, you're a Carolinian, aren't you? 

North Carolina. Yeah. Right. 

As much as they move-- 

To Wilmington-- 

Yeah-- (crosstalk) some friends of mine have-- it-- it-- you know-- 

Hopper has a big house down there. 

Exactly. Dennis-- Dennis has got a place down there. 

Well, I don't think he spends as much time now as he thought he was. 

No. But I also think that things happen where they happen, originally, because it's organically correct, you know? 

Yeah. 

And when you try and-- it's like film worked in L.A. because the light's right in L.A.-- 

Right. 

--all year around. That light is-- you know, I was in Spain a couple years ago and I've never been to any place that I loved as much as California and I-- until I went to Spain and I could live in Spain. I don't know if you've been to Spain, but i's just-- there's something magical about-- 

Right. 

And then I-- I went, ''Wait a minute.'' I pulled out my atlas real quick and went, ''Yeah, well, of course. The same''-- 

It's the same latitude. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

I want to ask about this before I go. When did this come out? 

It came out in the fall of '95. 

So this was the last CD? 

That's the last. 

Are you working on another one? 

No. Well, yes. Always. 

Always. I mean-- 

Every day. Not actively, no. We're not recording in the studio. I'm actually-- I've-- 

Is that dictated by whether somebody-- I mean, would you do it if somebody said, ''We're ready to-- we'll-- give us''-- 

Well, they would take one-- 

--''Give us 12 songs''? They'd take one in a second. 

Yeah, they would take it now. 

Now, would it-- 

What we did-- 

--sell, I mean, pretty much? I mean, do you-- have you found an audience so that you-- 

We have a-- 

--could product an album, it's going to-- 

I have a base foundation, yes. 

Yeah. You got-- you got enough people out there who are going to buy it, so-- 

You put it out-- you put it out and-- 

Why don't you-- 

--yes. 

--do it, then? Is it because you don't have anything to say? 

I don't want to stretch myself that thin. You know, I-- 

You don't want to do something that you think is weak. 

Well, I just don't want to feel forced to do it because what's been a-- what are we, '96? It came out in the fall of '95-- 

Yeah. 

--so it's only a year. 

Yeah. 

I like-- for me, the pattern has been about two years between albums. Now, I did go in and record some things right after we finished that, that may come out in the spring and it may connect to another film that Billy and I are toying with right now. 

What are you-- 

And it's all material-- well, there's a lot of if's there. There's a-- a script that, actually, Dennis Hopper told me about and he said, ''You need to-- you need to do this'' and it involves a singing angel and I said, ''I'm not playing a singing angel.'' But I read it and it's pretty fascinating and Billy and I are in the process of maybe doing it together. And if we do, this music that I cut unintentionally works for this film beautifully and it's-- and it's-- basically, it's a lot of cover songs, things I had done in clubs and-- so that's in the wings. 

Here is a video and we'll go out on this. This-- I guess the lead is this-- is this the lead, ''Sorry You Asked''? 

Oh, ''Sorry You Asked''? Yeah. 

That's the most popular. This was shot on location in a roller rink in-- Yeah. 

--the San Gabriel Valley. Yeah. 

Come back any time. It's great to have you here. 

Well, thank you for having me. 

Thanks very much. 

I appreciate it. 

It's a pleasure. 

It's a pleasure to see you. 

The movie, as I mentioned, is Sling Blade-- Dwight and Billy Bob Thornton. Here is the music video. Take a look. 

(singing) We started having problems in August last year / (unintelligible) had it rough for quite a while / And you know how you think it'll work itself out, it will miss the (unintelligible) by a long, long mile / And you'll be sorry you asked me the reason that she's not here with me tonight / I know you were probably just acting polite, you'll be sorry you ever asked why / (unintelligible) should have seen we were drifting apart, but I was in what I guess you'd call denial / And I'd always heard them say you're the last one to know / Hey, well, buddy, I was last by a long, long while--
