Good evening. I'm Anthony Mason filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with politics. President Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. The signature legislation of President Obama's eight years in office. On Monday, the Trump administration and house Republicans unveiled their plan to upend Obamacare. The bill seeks to eliminate the individual mandate for most Americans in favor of a new system of tax credits to attract people to buy insurance on the open market among other provisions. But the legislation faces stout resistance across the political spectrum including from within the Republican Party. Joining me now from Washington is Jake Sherman. He is a senior writer for POLITICO and coauthor of Playbook. Jake, welcome. 

Thanks for having me. 

To start with, Jake, the American Health Care Act is different fundamentally how from Obamacare? 

In many, many, many ways. As you mentioned at the top, it eliminates the mandate to buy health insurance. It eliminates a whole host of provisions that Democrats worked very hard to pass. And Republicans would argue this is a free market solution. But this is kind of where the divide is here. Republicans on Capitol Hill are positioning this as the largest entitlement program in perhaps American history, which is one of the big stumbling blocks, one of the big hurdles that Donald Trump and Paul Ryan need to overcome. And from a policy perspective, though, it does keep the main structure, the main framework of Obamacare, or the ACA, as it's officially called. And the "Wall Street Journal" editorial page actually conceded this in a very friendly forum for house Republicans, a forum that frequently supports what house Republicans and senate Republicans do. Said, they are not looking to tear up the American health-care system, which is something conservatives have seized on on Capitol Hill in expressing their opposition. 

Some of the opposition is calling it Obamacare Lite, correct, the Republicans. 

Right. That's right. And this is mostly coming from the House Freedom Caucus which is a group of 25 or so conservative lawmakers, many of them the same people that got John Boehner, that forced John Boehner to resign just a couple of years ago. A lot of these people though come from districts that are extremely supportive of Donald Trump. So the real big question here from a political point of view is what does Donald Trump do to break the fever? Republicans don't have a huge margin for error in passing this bill in either the house or the senate. And so will Donald Trump hit the campaign trail aggressively to rile up in favor, these lawmakers' constituents, in favor of the health care law. Now he's doing that on Saturday, he's traveling to Louisville, Kentucky, most notably, Senator Rand Paul is against this piece of legislation. We'll see how Donald Trump positions himself and positions the legislation in front of Rand Paul's constituents. 

Paul Ryan says he has the votes to pass this in the house. Is he right? 

He might be at some point. I don't believe even he -- I don't believe even he knows it at this point. I think it's very early. And one thing that we've kind of seen and it's become a continuing narrative of Donald Trump's administration, he is basically saying that he wants to repeal and replace the health care law, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and rewrite the entire tax code by the end of July. Now this is -- I've been covering Washington, covering congress for a decade. This is something that even the biggest optimists would say is a very rosy view of how Washington works. We have 60-something legislative days. In the 1980's, it took almost, I think, a little bit more than a year to rewrite the tax code and that was without Twitter and the cable news that we know today. So, I think that this situation that Paul Ryan is describing is probably going to be right at some point, but I don't think that his leadership knows right now whether they have the votes to pass this. I think he's projecting a little bit. 

Did the Trump administration anticipate the backlash or at least the level of backlash from within the party? 

It's difficult to know because many of the people Donald Trump surrounds himself with have no experience in government. His -- Steven Bannon was a media executive; Gary Cohn was the president of Goldman Sachs; his chief policy advisor, Stephen Miller, was most recently a communications aide on Capitol Hill, hardly somebody who is very seasoned in passing legislation or what it takes to get legislation across the finish line. So it's difficult to know if they expected it. I think on Capitol Hill the people I talked to last night, this morning, throughout the day, said that they are not surprised by the opposition from some of these outside conservative groups, the thorn in the side of Republicans in Washington. Some of these groups who kind of exist to try to purify or adhere the party to a strict ideological purity. So I think that they are not surprised at the level of outside complaints. I think some people were caught off guard because we thought we were still in the honeymoon period with Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, and clearly that honeymoon period is over. 

They're going to need some of these votes. What will they do to get them, do you think? What compromises do they have to make and how does that process proceed here? 

Well, this is the big divide between the White House and Capitol Hill Republicans. Capitol Hill Republicans say, listen, what you see is what you get. We put in a lot of work to this bill. We are not going to reopen this legislation to negotiation. Because once you do that, you really start -- it unravels. It's like a ball of yarn. Once you start pulling on it the whole thing is going to end up all over the floor. Now, the White House has signaled they're sending mixed messages. They're saying this is a working draft, let's talk. We are in game for negotiation. We are happy to horse trade. That needs to end according to Capitol Hill Republicans. Now, conservatives are being brought to the White House, the House Freedom Caucus, this conservative group, is going bowling at the White House which we'll see if they can do some, you know, bowling diplomacy. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is dining with the president. The president is really using the White House and trying to use the levers of power in a way that Barack Obama was not successful at. So whether he can make the case that, listen, the Republican Party has been promising this for years, this is what we can produce. This is what we can get the votes for. This is what we need to pass. That is what he really needs to say to congressional Republicans to get it across the finish line. 

The Democrats aren't even really in the conversation here, Jake. But this is ultimately their legacy that's being attacked. And Nancy Pelosi's legacy in particular, isn't it? 

It is. And they really don't have any power to do anything. Especially in the House of Representatives where Republicans have -- Democrats have been in the minority basically since they passed this law, I mean, this was -- most political prognosticators look at this law and say this is what cost Democrats the majority in 2010, and Republicans have had it for seven years since. They could complain, they are slowing down the hearings, the initial steps to getting this bill towards the floor. They are trying to throw up procedural hurdles in the house. None of them are going to stick. Now in the senate, Democrats have a bit more power. They are still not going to vote for this legislation, and don't really have a big formal role when it comes to this legislation's future. One thing we can say for certain in some way, shape, or form, the American health-care system is going to be different than it has been for the last couple of years. And that's an important thing for Democrats, for the future of the Democratic Party. 

Jake, one of the biggest changes was the elimination of the mandate and replacing it with a penalty if you don't maintain continuous coverage. The implications of that are not at all clear because I mean some people believe that actually that will discourage people who've lost coverage to stay out of the system, drive down the numbers which, of course, drives costs higher. Is the administration and its leadership able to sell that to their own party? 

No, and they're actually not really even trying to talk too much about the specifics. Because once you get into the specifics on this legislation or on basically reshaping and reforming the health-care system in the matter of a few months, we don't know, the Republicans have not said how many fewer people will be insured. They are not saying that -- they are not even saying that they want to insure the same level of people. They say they want to insure universal access to health care, which is much different than the way Barack Obama and Democrats talked about their legislation back in 2010, up until a couple of months ago. We don't know the cost of this bill. We don't know much about this bill. And they expect it to be on the floor in the house and in the senate before Easter, so in the next couple of weeks. And we just don't know much about it. We understand the broad contours. The American people could look at the text. I could look at the text. We all have looked at the text on Capitol Hill, but we don't know the implications and I'm not sure Republicans do either, frankly. 

And we haven't received an evaluation from the Congressional Budget Office either, the CBO Score, which usually tells you some idea of what the costs might be and/or how many people will be affected or might lose coverage. But the Republicans don't seem concerned about that? 

They are concerned about it privately because they're afraid of what it will look like for them. Sean Spicer and the White House have tried to position the CBO Score as not that important. They say it was not accurate when it came to Barack Obama's health care law. It won't be accurate for them, which if you're a Republican, that's a scary political reality. 

All right, Jake Sherman with POLITICO, thanks very much for being with us. 

Thank you.
