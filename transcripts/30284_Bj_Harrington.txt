We begin this evening with the attacks outside London's parliament today, the driver of a large vehicle ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring others before crashing into a railing, at least one man then exited the vehicle and approached parliament, where he stabbed an armed police officer to death. He was then later fatally shot by police. Hundreds of people, including Prime Minister Theresa May were inside parliament and were forced into lockdown. The attacks falls on the anniversary of the suicide bombings in Brussels that claimed more than 30 lives last year. London police commander BJ Harrington said: a full counterterrorism investigation is underway. 

The senior national coordinator had declared this a terrorist incident. And although we remain open-minded to the motive, a full counterterrorism investigation is already underway. 

And here is the latest on the attacks from the CBS evening news. 

There's breaking news in the terror attack in London, we have just received word that a fourth innocent person was killed in that attack today. Just as the British were on guard for a possible attack in the sky, they were struck on the ground, in the heart of London. A driver plowed a car into a group of pedestrians, then stabbed a police officer, at least four people including the officer were killed, 20 others were wounded. The attacker was shot to death by the police. Elizabeth Palmer is in London. 

There has been a terror attack. 

In only seconds, a car speeding along the sidewalk left a trail of broken and bleeding bodies strewn across one of London's busiest bridges. Seconds later, the car had crashed into the railings around parliament, setting off a panicked rush. In the chaos, shots rang out. (GUNSHOTS) It turned out the driver had shoved past security into parliament's grounds and started to stab a policeman until he was fatally shot by another officer. The attack began in early afternoon, when parliament was in session, but astonished politicians were suddenly told it was in lockdown. 

I'm now going to suspend the sitting of the House. This House is now suspended, but please wait here. (SIRENS) 

British Prime Minister Theresa May was whisked to safety, while on the nearby bridge paramedics helped the injured and fought to save the dying. Sunnita and Bobby Nagi, tourists from India, saw the whole attack unfold. 

He was speeding on the pavement and he was knocking off people walking by. So there was a big sound, one after the other. 

Yes. 

Sunnita ran. Bobby started filming. One victim flung under a bus... Another lying still in the middle of the road surrounded by shocked bystanders. 

I immediately told my wife that this is an attack, it's a terrorist attack. 

There was no question in your mind that he was going for as many people as he could get? 

Yes, he was. He was just going on and on, he didn't stop. 

One British member of parliament on his way to work did his best to save the staff policeman, but a short time later, he died. Police say a full terrorist investigation is underway into the most serious attack in London since the deadly subway bombings of 2005. 

Francine Lacqua of Bloomberg London joins me now from the scene. And also here, Katty Kay of the BBC is with me at the table. Francine, what do we know now? 

Well, Charlie, we've been briefed by police all evening, the attacks started about 2:20 PM local time. Now where I'm standing right now is on the south side of Westminster Bridge. We understand that a car, a vehicle went through the bridge trying to mow down pedestrians. We know 20 people are critically injured. We know three people died, and one extra person that was killed was the assailant. We understand so far that there was only one attacker. The car then continued to drive, took a left on to the House of Parliaments, that's when he got out of the car, took a knife out and stabbed a police officer. He was then apprehended by another police officer in civilian clothing who shot him. 

I've said London police commander BJ Harrington said a full counterterrorism investigation is underway. As far as you know, do the police, at this point, consider it likely to be a terrorist attack? 

Yes, Charlie. And this was actually clear right from the start, about 15 minutes after this was underway, we understand or we understood from both Scotland Yard but also senior officials in government that this was treated as a full-on terrorist attack. This is the most serious terrorist attack in over ten years. Again, there is an investigation underway, Charlie. So one of the things that they told reporters, and they briefed us numerous times, is not to speculate too much on who the attacker could be. We've heard from the prime minister, Teresa May, giving full statement outside Downing Street a couple of minutes ago. And what she was very clear on was that this was an attack and what she said was this was not only an attack, but it was an attack at the heart of our capital city. She is taking, of course, this very seriously, but we don't know much more beyond that. She was in a cobra meeting with civil servants and also senior police officers to try to figure out more on who exactly was behind the attack. 

Katty Kay, what can you add to this? 

Look, what we do know is that it seems like one assailant, armed only with a knife, Charlie, and a car managed to shut down one of the biggest cities in the world for the cost of -- 

And locked down parliament. 

Locked down parliament. To keep members of parliament, hundreds of members of parliament on lockdown inside the Houses of Parliament and terrorize one of the great cities in Europe, and one of the great cities in the world, and that's what terrorism does, right? That's why it is so effective. But it doesn't take very much for somebody -- we don't know who it is. We don't know who the assailant was. And we'll get that information as this investigation unfolds. But it is a remarkably brutal and successful form of terror in the western world that somebody is managing to perpetrate. 

For both of you, it also adds to this idea that as there is some success in Mosul, and maybe in Raqqa later, with respect to ISIS, even at its headquarters, there are other means to carry on that does not involve territory. 

Well, this is what the so-called Islamic state group has been wanting to do, to have freelance operations around the West as it gets squeezed in its caliphate in Syria and Iraq, it's feeling under pressure and it wants to show that it still has -- 

Alive and well. 

-- power, and it's still alive and well. And this is the way that it can do it. And the truth is we will never be able to stop this, right? We're never going to be able to totally eradicate people who are determined, if this is what it turns out to be, to take other people's lives and are prepared to sacrifice their own lives in the process. This is easy and it's cheap to do. 

Francine, does the London government -- British government view terrorism different in how they define it, how they act against it? 

Well, the U.K. government has, this evening, said that we stay at the same terror level alert. This was at high to severe about two years ago, meaning that a terror attack is likely. So we are not at the highest level, of course, we have police, we understand that for the next couple of days, there will be more police deployed. One of the ministers also said that they may call on the military if they find it necessary. But, Charlie, the big difference I see and I've covered a lot of terrorist attacks throughout Europe, I am thinking of Brussels, again you were saying, it was only a year ago to the day, that we saw that horrific airport attack in Brussels, is that we have a lot of CCTV cameras here. So in the past, when we've had attacks, or things that were heightened tensions for the public, it was fairly quick for the government and the police forces to find out who the perpetrators are, because we have so many CCTV cameras. I think we counted. It was about one camera for every 14 Londoners. 

The argument has sometimes been made that the British view it as a police matter. And that, therefore, the investigative powers of the local police, you know, is immediately employed. 

Well, certainly in this case. We're talking about the House of Westminster right? Right in the middle of London. There were a lot of tourists, there were a lot of politicians, there were a lot of school children, and indeed, there were French school children who were injured in the course of this attack. So immediately as this unfolded, you had the area swamped with police, some of them were armed police, which is unusual in the U.K., in and of itself. And the mayor of London, tonight, Sadiq Khan, has also said Londoners must be aware that there will be extra police and extra security on the streets over the next few days. Francine is right, there's not only CCTV footage, the other remarkable thing about this attack is that it was filmed by passers-by. We have the former minister of Poland who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment who produced video of the attack as it unfolded. 

So where are we now, Francine? What is the next thing to happen? 

Well, we are expecting and hoping to be briefed a little bit later on by metropolitan police, Scotland Yard, they've been keeping reporters up to date. But I do have to say, Charlie, that it took a little bit longer than expected or than usual for the prime minister to come out again. We do think that she was briefed quite extensively. She knows of these matters. She's handled them in the past. She was Home Secretary for over six years. So we're hoping to be briefed as much as we can, and then of course find out a little bit more about the injured. 

Thank you so much, Francine, as late as it is in London. 

Thank you. 

Thank you, my dear. Good to have you here. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

Katty Kay of the BBC. We'll be right back, stay with us.
