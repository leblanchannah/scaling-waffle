Welcome to the broadcast. Tonight this year's Tony award-winner for best featured actor in a play, Larry Fishburne will join us direct from Broadway. Also journalist Donald Katz depicts the real-life story of 45 years of turmoil in one average American family. We begin with a hard look at childhood today. Growing up in America has become a dangerous proposition. In a new book, Today's Children, Dr. David Hamburg demonstrates that poverty, drug abuse, violence, and more, have made our children a nation at risk. The president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Dr. Hamburg has written a prescription to address the very roots of our child development crisis, and we're very pleased to have him here with us this evening. Welcome. Pleasure. 

Thank you for having me here. 

Thank you for coming. Tell me why are our children at risk and what are the consequences of that risk? 

Well, there are many sources, but in the book I try to sketch out one set of risk factors, enormous changes in families and communities in the past 30 years or so. On the one hand, the very young, socially isolated, very poor mothers struggling to raise children all alone or with minimal resources. On the other hand, in the more affluent sector, huge changes in the divorce rates, women entering the workforce, a great boon for this society, and yet very little compensation from fathers or grandparents in terms of time with children, so that overall the time parents spend with children has dropped about half in the past 30 years, and many other things like that have happened, so the experience of growing up now is rather different than it was a few decades ago. That poses a great problem for this society. 

Why has it come to that? 

There are large social historical factors at work that are really hard to understand. We have a traditional emphasis on individualism in this society which is very good for us in a lot of ways, and yet we seem to have gotten very weak on the kind of mutual aid ethic. It's hard to think about a country as large as ours as a single extended family, but in a way that's what we are. We're all in one big leaky boat together, and somehow or other, society now is beginning to address what are the conditions under which kids can grow up in good shape. 

Yeah, but you think we have lost the sense of community? 

To some extent, I think we have, and very thoughtful people are working on that problem, John Gardner, for example. We have had an erosion of the sense of community, and we have to find some way to put that back together again. 

Why is it a country that is as rich as we are, in certain areas of childcare and perhaps more, stands in the lower fourth in the world in comparison to other industrialized nations? 

It is very puzzling. You know, Charlie, if you look at many indices in health and education, our casualties are a lot higher than the Europeans, or the Japanese, or the Canadians. 

Stop there. Is it because of value- -- Well, give me the facts. Give me the evidence in terms of how alarming the numbers are. 

Well, for example, if you look at infant mortality, which is important in itself, how many infants-- What's the rate at which infants die in the first year of life, it's kind of a proxy for a lot of other things a society does. 

Sure. 

How civilized is the society is to some extent measured by that, and we've been running through the '80s, 20th, 25th in the world, in that range, but it's not just a problem of let's say the inner city, because if you just take, let's say, the white only population, we run maybe 15th or so in the world. It's not terrific. 

But is it because of then -- Having those alarming numbers, why? Is there a lack of will, a lack of commitment, a lack of recognition, a lack of -- Because you make very clear that there is, in a sense, in this country, if we are to raise our childcare, it is not a question of just resources. It's not a question of just money. In the book, you cite very well that it is, in a sense, we have to adapt more of a selfless attitude towards children, and some people will have to act perhaps not in their immediate self-interest. 

Well, that's right. In general the European countries and Canada and Japan have a stronger mutual aid ethic with respect to children as a major social commitment, for example, that to the extent humanly possible, every woman will get prenatal care early, and the prenatal care will to some extent include education about caring for herself and the baby and what she's going to do with the rest of her life, and to some extent include kind of social support toward health and education for her and for her children, kind of a two-generation benefit, you know. We have some of that, but not nearly as much as they do. Maybe it's partly because we are so big, we are so heterogeneous, it's kind of hard to get a sense of identification with that great mass of people. 

Can we measure -- I want to talk about adolescence in a moment, but can we measure the notion of the impact for the early child of one parent? 

Well, there's an enormous amount of variation. Clearly one parent, a devoted, committed, resourceful, coping parent, can raise children very effectively, but it's hard. 

And in many ways is better than two bad parents. 

Well, yeah, absolutely, but on the average-- 

Right, uncaring parents. 

--Over the entire population, it's harder for one person to do it than the two, or two with a backup. In many ways, an ideal situation is a cohesive family with both parents there, and with some grandparents or aunts or uncles around so that in a crunch there are lots of people to help out, there are lots of sources of ideas and information and context. It's much harder to do it alone, but it can be done. 

What about the sense of adolescence now as the second most crucial period, that time I guess, between what, nine? What ages? 

We focus on about 10 and 15, early adolescence. 

10 and 15, yeah. 

It's a fascinating time, marked by the big changes in the body, the changes of puberty, and the kids are sort of asking, "What's happening to me? What's happening to my body? What am I going to become?" But that biological change, which in a way is the largest biological upheaval in the whole lifespan, roughly coincides with a big social upheaval, the move from elementary to junior high or middle school, which typically is from a small, neighborhood school to a big impersonal warehouse type of operation. Those two things coming in conjunction makes it a very interesting and stressful time. 

Yeah, you make a point that junior high should be abolished. 

Well, that's my personal inclination. 

All right, but let me hear that. 

If not abolished, drastically changed anyway. 

Because? 

Well, at the core of it is that it's really essential to have sustained, individual attention in a constructive mode, and so many of our junior high schools now are way too big and too impersonal, and kids kind of get lost in there. Now you can do it by breaking up the big schools into small units, and there are some schools in New York like that, a school within a school or a house, whatever you want to call it. That's one aspect. There are other aspects of it, but another feature is you really need to have that education specifically adapted to the experiences of these kids. For example, to teach the life sciences around the principle of development, and starting with puberty is a very good way to go. Let the kids understand what's happening to them. 

Is part of the reason that we have not devoted the amount of resources, focus, national will towards children, the fact that they don't vote and they don't have political power? 

It certainly is. It's got to be a factor. They don't vote, they don't have political power. Now, you can ask why aren't their parents more aggressive in advocacy for them, and I must say that is somewhat puzzling. It seems to me there was a time when parents were more vigorous politically (inaudible) for their children, but at the moment, their political strength is weak. 

Okay. Dr. David Hamburg is here. His book is called Today's Children. It is an alarming look at some of the problems that we face in this nation, and a call for dialog with respect to the political community, and some options for creating a future for this generation which is in crisis. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're back with Dr. David Hamburg. Dan Quayle, family values, the speech that he made, talk to me about family values as you see them, and what kind of debate ought we be having, and what kind of questions ought we be asking in this country? You know, with the Vice President at least opening that initiative, questions were immediately raised by some of his opponents saying, "Well, if you look at what the Bush administration did and the initiatives they've done, perhaps they haven't shown enough interest in family," but looking at it just from the kinds of questions we ought to be asking to address what I think is an important question? 

Well, I think the orientation to family values is very fundamental. I don't see that as conservative or liberal. It's a fundamentally human attribute. In my perspective, the focus is on the experience of a child growing up. What does it take to meet the fundamental requirements of being human? It so happens that human children have a long period of relative helplessness. They're vulnerable for a long time. It seems crazy from an adaptive point of view, but on the other hand what you get out of that is the opportunity to learn a fantastic amount from infancy onward, to adapt to whatever circumstances may exist over a very wide range of conditions. That's in a way what got us here in our long human history. If you're going to have that opportunity for learning, it takes protection and nurturance and guidance and stimulation and feedback, and historically, for millennia, that's come mainly from families, not entirely, but mainly from families. Now the world is changing so rapidly that we have to find ways to strengthen families to do that, to provide kids what they need to grow up intact, and also to provide some family equivalent functions beyond the family. 

Can we ever hope to do that unless we get at the question of drug addiction and crime in urban areas? 

That's a very important part of it. In that respect, Los Angeles was a wake-up call, even a kind of a code blue medical emergency. The patient is dying in that sense, the inner city, with conditions that are extremely conducive to drug abuse and violence in a way. There's a high prevalence of empty lives, of kids growing up largely alone or on the street or with immature peers without very much of the responsible, caring, adult supervision, guidance, nurturance, support that is vital for. 

Does anybody have an idea how to get at that? 

I try to spell out in the book, in the last section called Tackling the Hardest Problems, some important approaches to the extent possible based on recent research. I do think there are promising approaches, yes. 

Like? 

Like. It starts with the earliest caretakers, be it a doctor or a teacher of young children or a family member. In effect, to ask, for a child in a extreme poverty circumstance, "Does this child really have a family or something like a family?" How can you strengthen the capacity of the family members to care for the child? To the extent possible, you want to do that, and there are ways sketched out in there that can be done. Also, you almost always have to say, "How can you supplement these often smashed families with family equivalent functions outside?" For instance, the Congress of National Black Churches has a set of activities around the country that reaches out to parents of young children and supports them and helps them to give the necessary guidance and to augment what the parents themselves can do with other favorable experiences in the early years or after school hours or on Saturdays or in the summertime as kids are growing up. That's an example of support in the community of family-like functions to augment weakened families. 

What's the link with violence? What do we know about the recent studies? 

The kids joined into violent gangs in places like Los Angeles are to a certain extent, to a considerable extent, leading empty lives. They don't have much of a perception of opportunity. They don't see much hope for the future. They can earn respect and earn money, in their view, with some- 

Engaged in crime and drug-related activities. 

Right, some mixture of drugs and violence. That is really a wake-up call, because you're getting, in that sphere, just as you get in the international sphere, a kind of escalation and proliferation. By that I mean, escalation, the upping of the killing power of the weaponry being used on the streets, and by proliferation I mean lots more people able to use it. That in itself makes us want to take a prevention approach. An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure in this field. You want the kids to grow up with some perception of opportunity and some skills and some knowledge so they can make it in the mainstream economy. Otherwise, the path is to drugs and guns. 

Was there a time in which we made that turn so that we began to lose this generation, to put this generation at risk because of all these factors we talked about? 

There certainly has been some turning points, and there are ironies and even paradoxes of success. For example, the research of William Julius Wilson and his colleagues at the University of Chicago in the Chicago inner city shows that there was an awful lot of loss of jobs for low-skill workers willing to work very hard. As the Rust Belt occurred, as the steel industry declined and so on, a lot of jobs that were there that supported families in at least some decent working conditions, those jobs disappeared. Then along with that you had this paradox of success that many previously poor people entered the middle class, got opportunities, moved out of the neighborhood, so you have these smashed neighborhoods where the jobs aren't there and where successful people aren't there and the support networks that could lead kids to a mainstream economy largely have eroded. That's one big problem. 

The tax base was gone and everything. 

Tax base gone, institutions gone. 

The institutions just corroded and just fell of their own weight without those kinds of supports. 

One of the things we have to do is to find some ways to rebuild community-based organizations that can reach out to these kids and their mothers. 

This is a locker room question. Single best idea you've heard or you propose for children in the next decade. 

One of those, as good as any, we've just touched on this, actually a major study that our foundation is bringing out shortly on community-based organizations, the religious organizations, the youth organizations, the adult service organizations, what they can do to be more effective in poor communities. I think there's a great thrust there. If you put them next to the schools, you cover most of the time available for kids growing up. You could have constructive institutions, not perfect, but better than now. That's the important criteria. We've got to think about this in terms of prevention and in terms of doing better than we're doing now. 

Also, to somehow ennoble those who stand. I take note when I see in Los Angeles and everywhere else those people whose very lives, in terms of what they are doing for their children, stand as a symbol for all of us. You see those examples of people who really don't get any attention and the sacrifices they make, the leadership they gave, maybe too few of them, but there are these remarkable examples of single parents, of two-parent families, of people going out of their way, stretched to the end, but with a singular devotion to the self-esteem and the care of their children. 

Absolutely. Tremendous skill in coping with adversity. Your points really highlights the immense loss of talent that's occurring now under those terrible conditions. It makes you wonder. Let's go back a generation. How many young Einstein's were lost in the concentration camps? How many young Martin Luther King's get lost in the ghetto? 

Thank you very much, Doc. Today's Children, by Dr. David Hamburg. He's a psychiatrist, actually, by training, aren't you? 

Yes. 

He is also on the board of Stanford University still, and is passionately interested in today's children and concerned about the risk to them. When we return, journalist Donald Katz describes one family's personal voyage through the social revolutions of post-war America. We'll talk about that when we return. Anyone who needs proof of the changes that have taken place in the American family since World War II need only read journalist Donald Katz's new book, Home Fires. He has documented the turbulent unraveling of one family's suburban dream through their own recollections of the past 45 years. He joins us now with Ricky Gordon, a composer and one of the subjects of Home Fires. Welcome, Ricky. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

A pleasure. Tell me how this got started, the genesis of Home Fires. 

Ricky and I were jogging partners here in Riverside Park between 1983 and 1987. I was working on another book at the time. He was working on his operas. We told family stories to each other. I was always struck by how incredible it was that one family should've touched just about every cultural, political, economic, and dysfunctional experience that you could think of through a half century of American post-war history. 

Set the time. What was the time for that? 

The jogging was '83-'87. I heard the stories, and at one point five years later somebody said to Ricky, "What happened to your family, this family that started out -- The aspirations for Sam and Eve Gordon were to be a normal American family. They'd lived through the Depression. He survived the war. He was going to take his family to the suburbs in 1952 from the Bronx. Everything went awry." Ricky said, "The times." I remember thinking, "That's what the humanities is about." Is it the times? Is it history? Is it Freudian predisposition? Genetics? Family structure? 

Tell us what you did, though. Once you decided, what did you do? 

After I decided that it was a book, I started collecting the family stories. I spent four years creating this family as a chassis for the whole 50 years. I was basically doing two books for about two years. I was doing a whole social and political history of the post-war era, the whole sense of what the family experts were saying at the time, and then I was creating the intimate story of what happened in the Gordon household, which was quite dramatic. 

Tell me how you felt when this intruder comes in to document, to observe, to record. 

At first, I felt frightened. I felt like it might rob some of my work from me. I felt flattered. I felt a lot of the natural stuff, you know. It's like everybody wants to be famous, and in a book, and terrific. It was, I felt, myriad things, and so did my other family members. Nobody said yes right away, and that took a while. Like when Don first asked me, I went home to my parents, were living in Florida, and I kind of was the liaison and convinced everybody to do it. 

I think they all had different reasons. You know these are people who are particularly creative and aggressive. Through the whole era they are there at the front lines. Somebody is at Woodstock, at Altima. Somebody touches every spiritual movement, every drug is ingested, every possible familial combination occurs, and sexual adventure. It's just quite amazing, so I think they saw the book as the next step in their constant search for interpretive framework. 

For example, you say that the 60s counterculture claimed each of the kids in one way or the other. 

Yeah. 

Right? How so? 

Well, for example, my two older sisters, my sister Susan was a writer; present at many important events in the 60s, and so is my sister Lorraine, and she ended up getting married and having a kid at 17. 

Changing her name to Leila. 

Right she got into yoga and everything. 

Before having children that stem a need for this normal aspiration. They were named Rum, Shiva, Gopaul, and Magdalena Shapiro. 

Right. 

What was the struggle for both of you, and just jump in. What was the struggle to live up to the expectation of the American Dream? 

I think it was, in Sam and Eve's sense, when they came to this suburb, it's a poignant section in '52, they move with 250 other families on the same day from the Bronx to a new development on the south shore of Long Island; they really felt they'd arrived. The first man in his family to have a car, to have a house, and to have the promise land. 

They'd gotten their piece. 

They had gotten their piece, and all of the family troubles caused by things like the Depression, the War, by the immigration, it's multi-generational, the grandparents are in the book, too. This was over, and suddenly, by late 1956, Susan is going off to the earliest rock concerts in the movie palaces. An 11 year old Lorraine's toddling behind her. They were gone. 

What was the hardest thing for you? Were there defining moments in all of this? 

Yes, in terms of the book? 

Yeah. 

The hard thing is being exposed. You know, my sexuality. 

Tell me about it. 

Well, my homosexuality is in this book, and stuff about my drinking, drugs. I really had to decide that it can be, for me, a political stance to be truthful about who and what I am, and that's what I think is courageous about my family. That's all one has, I suppose, so I have my truth, and it's in the book, but it's scary for it to be out in the open for thousands of people to read. 

It may be pat, but it clearly changed your life. The book. 

Yes, it did. Definitely. 

In a positive way? 

Yes. 

Because it forced you to -- 

Confront a lot of things. Not only that, it changed my family's life. It made our family, I think, a lot closer. It brought, I've been with my sister Shelia a lot lately, and you relive a lot of your childhood memories. You relive everything in the genealogy of this book. 

Is there downside, though, here? 

Well, I was worried about the ramifications of presenting each of these members of a family with a document that purported to be their own life story from their own perspective. Everybody who knew and loved them, their teachers, their rabbis, their people who abandoned them. I think how would any of us react to that, but they handled it. 

Let me give you an example. I mean, what I've thought about when I thought about this concept. Bob Woodward from the Washington Post has said, "Listen, you know, this paper for example, wouldn't like for somebody to come in and, I wouldn't like for somebody to come in and examine my life, the way I examine other people's life as a reporter." You know, and here, your lives are examined ending up here, for everybody to know. Following, talk to 'em, told them stories, and that's have, in some cases -- 

I think at this point, they realize, it's helping other people. People see themselves in this book. There's something about taking a real story, people know it's a real family, setting it up against a sense of the times, which we all lived to. There's a healing capacity to it. 

It had to be nonfiction? It had to be a real family? It had to be identified? You had to have that grim, I mean, that edge of reality? Well, grim was the wrong word, I would say. 

No, it had to be real. 

The grim reality. 

Edge of reality. 

It's an important point. Nonfiction has to kind of - No, I think right now, the culture demands real stories. People are looking for their own interpretations in real life. Look at the culture of meetings, 12 steps, daytime television, real life television. Nonfiction's very powerful, and that's why, you know, - 

Can you ever leave the Gordons? 

In some ways I feel like I'm part of the family, and I'm looking forward to the next era, which is that I can just be their friend. 

You won't be writing about the next generation? 

I won't. 

(inaudible) more interviews. 

No more interviews, and I do think that they communicated with each other through this book, too, by telling me things they hadn't told each other. I think there was a component. 

It also contributed to our work. I mean, all Don heard about, a lot of these stories because I was writing an opera about my family. I won the National Institute for Music Theater award for this piece, and it really feeds one's work, because no matter how much you ask your own family what happened, they never tell one another the way they all seem to blab to Don. 

Home Fires: An Intimate Portrait of the Middle Class Family in Postwar America. Thank you very much. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thanks, and congratulations. When we come back, a moment a Hollywood veteran. He's captivated Broadway. He is actor Larry Fishburne. He'll be here, straight from Broadway, when we return. Larry Fishburne is a rare breed of actor. He has learned his craft through years of work, rather than classes. The 20 year journey he began at the age of 10 has recently paid off, after critical acclaim in last summer's Boyz n the Hood, and a starring role in Deep Cover. He earned a Tony for his Broadway debut. He joins us now, as I said, direct from the Walter Kerr Theater where he continues the role in August Wilson's Two Trains Running, and we are very pleased to have him here. Welcome. 

Thank you. Thanks a lot, Charlie. 

The amazing thing, I mean, you must know this, but the anticipation, people, because we put in the elevator who's coming up, and people stop me and say, "Larry Fishburne's going to be here?" I mean I don't know whether it's Boyz n the Hood, I don't know if it's Two Trains Running, I don't know whether it is people who have watched the evolution of whatever it is. I mean, I learned things about you I didn't even know. I mean, you were in Apocalypse Now, which I didn't know. 

Right, I think it's a lot of those things. I think it's the fact that I did a soap opera when I was 11 years old. 

Was it One Life -- ? 

One Life to Live. 

One Life to Live, right. 

People that saw the first movie, Cornbread, Earl and Me, Apocalypse Now fans, gosh, King of New York fans. People who had the opportunity to see me at Second Stage, where I did some theater here in New York, maybe five, six, seven years ago. Certainly, Boyz, and -- 

Pee-wee. 

Pee-wee. I mean, it's, you know. 

Let me go back, way back for you. Your father is what? He's is a corrections officer? 

My father is a corrections officer. 

And your mother's a school teacher. 

Yes. 

And she's from Georgia? 

Yeah, well, actually my mother's from South Carolina. It's a place, I think it's called, North Augusta, and it's in South Carolina. My father's from New York. 

Where does the acting come from? Neither of them, obviously, are trained in the theater. 

I think it comes from being an only child, a bit of a latchkey. My mother had to work a lot of jobs. She and my father divorced very early, so in my youth I was kind of left to my own devices, to sort of play with myself, if you will, and I kind of just acted out a lot, I guess is what it is. 

But it wasn't that she was a stage mother, or was she? 

No, no, no. She wasn't a stage mother. 

It was you -- 

No, it was me. It was something that was in me that I was constantly doing. 

What was it? Was it just imagination, just the fact that -- 

I think it was imagination and slight boredom, and then my environment where I lived, there were a lot of different people, a lot of different cultures and things. I would try and reproduce sounds that I heard, and act out things that I saw on TV and in the movies that my father took me to. 

Kind of poor? 

Yeah, not wealthy. 

How is it that a Larry Fishburne makes it, and probably kids that you know didn't make it? 

I was fortunate enough to have my mother guide me, in the sense that she recognized in me this talent, and wanted to do everything that she could to nurture it, so she took me to auditions. She asked people questions about how to get one's child involved in this business, and she really nurtured my creativity. The other thing was that I was very serious about it, I guess, without even really being aware of it. That it was something that I never, ever just kind of took for granted. I was really concentrated and really focused. 

Did you have blinders on? 

Yeah. 

I mean, you were -- 

This is what I'm -- 

-- this is what I'm going to do. 

I'm going to do it. 

Was there any doubt that you would do it, that you would be able to find your place? 

No, no, I had role models- 

Because you believed in your talent? 

-- I had great role models. I mean I could go to the movies and see Sidney Poitier, I could go to the movies and see James Earl Jones. I knew that these cats were out there doing the work, so I knew it was possible. 

So what was the first big break at 10? 

The first big break, actually, there was a couple of them. Things sort of kind of happened to me and they stacked up for me. I mean I got accepted to Performing Arts, got Apocalypse Now at the same time, so I had two opportunities to do great things and I took Apocalypse Now. I got cast in a film, a television movie and the woman that saw it that created One Life to Live, Agnes Nixon saw my performance on this thing and wrote a part for me on the soap opera, so things kind of always- 

She's kind of a dean of soap opera -- 

Oh yes. 

I mean have a great talent, I guess she wrote a lot of it herself. 

Yes, she did. 

And so you go to the Philippines for Apocalypse Now. How old are you, 14? 

14. 

14. 

14. 

I mean, come on, I mean let's grow up real quick. 

Baptism by fire, for sure, yeah, 14, 15, 16. 

I haven't Heart of Hearts, did they put some new things -- 

Hearts of Darkness. 

Hearts of Darkness, are you in it? 

I'm in Hearts of Darkness as a 14 year old and as like a 29 year old. 

Now, what was it like there, and what do you learn from Brando, and what do you learn from Duvall and what do you learn from Sheen and what do you learn from Francis? 

Well, from Martin Sheen I learned that I was a great actor. 

How so? 

Martin, I had a scene to do that was cut out of the film and I had to do it like a hundred times and I was really becoming exhausted and I was getting no sympathy from anybody and Martin came up to me and he said, "Did anybody ever tell you you were a really good actor?" and nobody had. So that means a lot to me, and I carry that with me. 

That's amazing when you just stop how many, I wonder how many kids, whatever they are, if somebody put their hand on their shoulder and said, "You can do it, you're good." Here you are, with whatever you have and knowing you had talent, a fellow peer comes along and says, "You got it." 

Yeah, and it was very important. It helped me get through a lot, you know, the times when you doubt that you should be doing this, "Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?" You know, you have those moments as an actor, as an artist period. That was the kind of thing that helped me along. 

Yeah, I remember once, on a personal note, I was doing a show that I didn't like doing something, and Bill Cosby said to me, "Hey, they can take the show away, but they can't take your talent away." You know, it meant a lot at a personal time. Robert Duvall, what did he say? 

Bobby was very funny. I showed up, and he was working on his tan, because he wanted to be tan for the movie. I was like 14, I didn't know anything, Bobby looked at me and said, "So, what are you, you're a young actor, right?" I thought, "Wait a minute, he means something by that." I couldn't figure out what, but I understood, you know, it's like you're a young actor, you're green, it's okay. Just watch the big boys and you'll be okay. 

And he actually thinks of acting as a craft. 

Yes, yes, he does. 

Francis thinks of it as art. 

Yeah, well movie-making as an art. Movie making is art. 

And Marlon thinks it's what? 

Rubbish. 

It's a joke. 

Yes. 

I'm embarrassed, I do it for the money. Isn't it amazing this man- 

Well, I learned from him- 

-- who has such incredible, go ahead -- 

I learned from him not to take it so seriously. 

Yeah, in the end we're entertainers. But you do take it seriously, don't you? 

I do take it seriously, but you know you have to have a sense of humor. 

You can't let it consume you, so that you lose. 

You've got to be able to laugh at yourself. 

I mean were you doing the smoking and everything else -- where was, was your mother with you? 

My mother was there. 

And what was she saying about her son who's, you know? 

As I said before, my mother was very smart. My mother gave me a lot of freedom to excel and to fall and she was really there for me. She was my rock and my foundation during those years. 

Larry Fishburne, back in a moment. Stay with us, we'll talk about Two Trains Running, August Wilson's play, we'll also talk about Boyz N the Hood and a lot of other things with this extraordinary actor. Back in a moment. We're back with Larry Fishburne, let me just speed ahead. Let's just do the chronology though. After Apocalypse Now you came back and did what? 

Came back from Apocalypse Now and did Death Wish II. 

Oh that's right, with Charles Bronson, right? Playing a good guy or a bad guy? 

Oh, a terrible, horrible person. And then did Rumble Fish with Coppola. A lot of episodic television in between that, and then I came back to New York because I had moved to LA. Got back to New York, did a little theater- 

Because you wanted to be on the theater? 

No, just because I wanted to get back to New York. Then I did Cotton Club with Coppola. Did some more theater, started working at the second stage theater, did a Michael Weller play called Loose Ends and another play called Short Eyes by Miguel PiÃ±ero. 

Prison Play. 

Right, Prison Play, and then I did a movie called Quicksilver with Kevin Bacon which was followed by The Color Purple with Whoopi Goldberg and Steven Spielberg, and -- 

Danny Glover. 

Danny Glover, and then some other things happened. School Daze. 

Right, School Daze. Tell me about Spike Lee, because there is this story, that you two haven't worked together since then, and what's the conflict? 

Well, um -- 

That doesn't mean that if he called you up and had a great play you wouldn't read it, a great scene you wouldn't read it and say? 

If he had something great I would absolutely read it. I think that School Daze was Spike's first big picture, and I was pretty much the senior man myself and Giancarlo we were actors who were journeymen, we had been around for 15 years. So there were things that Spike was doing that sort of I guess we knew better, and we wanted to say those things to him, and he didn't really receive them very well. 

And what would he do? 

Well, he would just shut down, I mean, Spike is a man of few words. 

He doesn't talk a lot when he's on the set? 

No, he doesn't, well, at least not at that time. 

Or he didn't talk to you. 

I don't know what is happening with him now, I've heard that he has opened up quite a bit. He does give you a lot of freedom as an actor, but then at the same time he had this cut-off point and that's when things could get sticky. 

The freedom only went to a certain distance. 

Yeah, and then it would get sticky so it got to be kind of a drag, but I mean Spike and I still, you know, talk to one another, we see each other and we're fine, I mean, it's not like I don't think we wouldn't want to work with one another again. I think we have great respect and admiration for one another. 

Is he more, in your judgment, I mean I thought, I liked Jungle Fever, for example, is he more of a what, is he more of a producer than a director in a sense? He's a guy who knows how to put it together? 

Yeah, he's really a great organizer. Really a great marketer. He has really wonderful wit about a lot of things. I think the way in which he tells his stories is a bit unorthodox and perhaps it doesn't work for everybody, but it is through-provoking I mean, and again, you have to give Spike his credit because he is responsible for John Singleton, and he is responsible for Robert Townsend. 

Why? Because he led the way and proved- 

Because he was the guy who went to the door and said, "Open the door. There is a market and there is an audience and there are stories to be told. There are people to make these films and they happen to be African American and they can do it." 

What talked was the fact that he made films and people went to see that made money and gave John Singleton a chance to do the same thing. Tell me about Boyz N the Hood. 

Yeah, it's weird because it's like having lightning strike on you twice, you know, here am I sitting there completely unawares, and some young black cat comes up to me and says, "I make movies." I'm like, "Okay." 

And he's like what, 20? 

He's like 18 when I met him. But again, a completely different style and approach than Spike. More rooted in the traditional way of telling stories via the medium of film rather than creating kind of these mosaics that Spike creates. 

Did he write the script? 

Yes, he did. 

I've heard you say it's the perfect script almost. 

It's air tight. 

Air tight, meaning what? 

Absolutely perfect. 

Meaning that every line resonates. Every line is just as if -- 

There's nothing that we changed. When I worked with Spike, give you the difference. Working with Spike, Spike comes up with this great blueprint, this great framework through which you can hang a lot of different things on, and what John came up with was something that was so airtight you didn't have to do anything to it to embellish it really, in terms of changing dialog or a word here or a word there. 

And has John's success opened the door for other people? 

I believe so. I believe that John is actually the standard by which young black filmmakers, young film makers, period, should set their goals. 

Because? 

Because he makes really fine films, and he really has a well thought out story that he wants to tell that's human, that touches everybody across the spectrum, and he really knows the medium. 

What are you working on? Aren't you working on a film, or you completed a film? 

I just, I just, looks like I'm going to do a film called In Search of Bobby Fischer, or Searching for Bobby Fischer with Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna. 

Who's going to direct? 

A young man named Steve Zaillian, who wrote- 

This is Bobby Fischer the chess king? 

Yes. It's about a little kid who's a chess prodigy, and I play one of his teachers and Ben Kingsley plays one of his teachers. 

Is there anything that hasn't come out yet that's in the can? 

The only thing that's in the can right now is something that was done for Robert De Niro's company, Tribeca TV, it's a television show called Tribeca Stories, I believe. It will air in September some time. 

How did you get to Two Trains Running? 

Two Trains. 

August Wilson. 

It was great, I actually got hired to do a play that I've always wanted to do called Dutchman, and the first day of rehearsal I heard back from my Two Trains audition that they wanted me to do the part, and I said, "Sorry guys, I gotta go." 

You gotta go. If August calls, and Lloyd Richards calls -- 

You gotta go. 

And what'd they say? 

Who? Lloyd and August or the other people? 

No, the other guys, the Dutchman. 

They breathed real heavy and they said, "We understand." 

And what is it, tell me about the character, because this character who is dead in Pittsburgh, well, set it up for me, it's set in Pittsburgh, and your character comes back from prison and it's a cafe, you know, and there's a great debate going on in this cafe about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King and definitions and you, how do you fit in? 

Sterling is, it's great that he fits in, because I mean the cafe is really full of misfits. In their own little way, they're all kind of misfits. He is, I guess, what you could call the new black man of that time. A new black man who is more open to Malcolm's rhetoric than Martin's, let's say. 

What is is about Malcolm's rhetoric? 

That is was about self-defense, it was about standing on your own, it was about self-determination and self-reliance and not relying on someone else. It was about if you want something from somebody, you know, somebody took something from you and you felt like you were wronged, you were perfectly within your rights to go take it back from them, that kind of thing. 

What's the satisfaction for you, in terms of -- 

There's a lot of satisfaction. One, I get to work with Lloyd Richards who is the black director who, the first black director to direct a play on Broadway that featured African American people. That's a great big satisfaction. 

Also the dean of the old drama school. 

Absolutely, and also to have originated a role in an original play was one of my goals as a child, so I've done that. To play the great white way in a show that was written by an African American and directed by an African American that features an African American cast and is a straight play was another thing- 

A straight play, meaning -- 

No singing -- 

No singing. 

-- no dancing, drama. 

And does the Tony change your life in any way? 

I don't know. I haven't even seen the Tony since I went to the awards. What's been nice about the Tony is that people say, "Congratulations" and it's the recognition of my peers and people in the theater. It means that they appreciate the work and they think that it's good, and that's wonderful, but the prize is just getting here. 

They used to say about Laurence Olivier, doing all the stuff he does, he always wanted to do a Broadway musical. Is there anything that you've always, a role that you'd die to do that you've wanted to do? Having done this on Broadway, being such a central part, you know, these people who were telling a brilliant African American historical story decade by decade. I mean, is there something that you -- 

Well, I want to play Jimi Hendrix. 

You want to be Jimi Hendrix, because of musical talent or because you just -- 22 To me he was just the -- The most brilliant guitarist you'd ever heard. 

I mean Jimi was like god to me for a long time. 

Yeah. 

So, I would really like to do that. 

Talk to Oliver Stone. 

Have you expressed this idea to anybody? 

No, just you and your viewers. 

You heard it here. Well, there you go. 

Jimi Hendrix, that's a good idea, because I didn't like the one that Oliver Stone did, The Doors, did you? 

I didn't get a chance to see it. 

Come on, you never saw it? 

No. 

Two Trains Running. Thank you for coming. 

You're welcome, Charlie. 

Congratulations on the Tony, come back anytime. 

All right. 

Larry Fishburne. Thank you for joining us. Next time we'll be joined by Michael Kramer of Time Magazine, Joe Klein of Newsweek and they'll take a look at the political turf as we count down to the Democratic National Convention here in New York City. All that coming up. See you tomorrow.
