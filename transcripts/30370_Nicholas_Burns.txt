We continue our coverage of the Trump administration's big week on the national security stage. Joining me from Washington, David Ignatius. He is foreign affairs columnist for "The Washington Post." From Boston, Nicholas Burns. He is a professor at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and served as Undersecretary of State for political affairs under George W. Bush. I'm pleased to have both of them back on this program. Nick Burns, let me begin with you and something you said to me before we went on camera. This is a remarkable sort of week, I think you said day, in the foreign policy history of a president. 

Well, it could be, Charlie. You know, Donald Trump is so unpredictable, you never know what he is gonna say and do next. But look what happened today. Rex Tillerson went to Moscow and said we're at the lowest point in our relationship with Russia in memory. Donald Trump backed that up in the press conference he had with the NATO secretary general. They really took it to the Russians and were extremely critical of what the Russians have been doing in Syria. Rex Tillerson brought it back rightly to Ukraine and Crimea. And he also said, Tillerson, a couple of days ago, that Russian interference in our election was a problem. That is I think progress, and calling a spade a spade. This relationship is at a low point and the Russians are trying to undercut the United States. And I also thought, Charlie, it was interesting to see Donald Trump, who for 18 months has been railing against NATO saying NATO is obsolete -- and you'll forgive me, I'm a former ambassador to NATO -- and today Donald Trump said NATO is no longer obsolete. He said NATO used to not be fighting terrorism, and now is fighting terrorism. NATO wasn't spending enough, and now they are on track to spend more. So he tried to put a positive gloss on these issues where he has been extremely critical. And it may be we're seeing the re-centering, we'll see, of the administration. Maybe these establishment figures like Jim Mattis at Defense, and H.R. McMaster, General McMaster at the NSC, and Rex Tillerson are winning some of the policy battles at the White House. 

David, this is interesting because your column says some of the similar things, so you two seem to be on the same page. 

I agree with what Nick said. In that column this morning, Charlie, I quoted Tom Donilon who was National Security Advisor for President Obama who thought the strike on Syria was appropriate, but said the changes on policy on Russia, China, and Syria, from the administration and in recent weeks, have been whiplash-inducing, was the phrase he used, just such sharp changes from what Donald Trump talked about during the campaign. He was going to get closer to Russia. China was raping America and was our biggest prospective adversary. Syria was something to stay away from. Now, we are seeing he has changed all those. I do think that the president is listening more to his foreign policy team than he did. And listening a lot less to the person who's encouraged him to be a disrupter, dismantler, and that's Steve Bannon. It's really striking to me how the knives are out for Steve Bannon. The things that the journalists like me are hearing from the White House about Bannon and the president's anger at Bannon for his, what is claimed as his attempt to grab attention for himself, tells you that Trump has moved from being very pro-Bannon to considerably less so. On these foreign policy issues, as Nick says, we're just going to have to see. Just a final thought from me. I am struck by the way in which Donald Trump is doing what Henry Kissinger prided himself on doing, which is playing the triangular relationship, the U.S., Russia, and China. Playing off the two superpower rivals, seeking advantage, leaning one way then the other. That is a classic Kissinger balance of power diplomacy and oddly enough Donald Trump, most inexperienced president in my lifetime, seems to be doing a little bit of that. 

And there is this. I think Jared Kushner is being schooled by Henry Kissinger, you may know a lot more about that than I do, but I know that there have been conversations as Jared Kushner realizes that he has not been in government, he has a lot to learn, and he reaches out to learn as much as he can. 

Charlie, I have that same impression. Jared Kushner, 36 years old, young man, Harvard grad but not much experience certainly with foreign policy. I think Henry Kissinger has taken Jared Kushner on as a project. Henry Kissinger's last project he may undertake in trying to teach him about the way in which a great power like the United States maneuvers, especially in a period of adversity. We have to remember that Kissinger came in at a time when the Vietnam War had really enfeebled the United States, it was thought, similar time now, many would argue. And invisibly, we don't read or hear about this, it seems that Kissinger is giving advice to Kushner and through him to the president. 

Nick Burns, is -- how do you perceive the Russians to be reacting? 

I think the Russians are angry. And a little bit stunned. I mean, Charlie, we all saw, during the transition in the first month of the administration, all those positive words from Donald Trump. The Russians were thinking this could be a sea change in the relationship with the United States. There's tremendous disappointment about this in Moscow. President Putin kept Secretary Tillerson waiting a little bit, didn't get his meeting until the very end of the day. There was suspense on whether or not Putin would see him. So I think there were dashed hopes there. But what do the Russians expect, given everything that they've done in eastern Europe and the Middle East to undercut the United States, plus the interference in our election? And I think President Trump is boxed in, obviously, on these charges that there may have been collusion, we don't know, between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. But the open, what we do know is the Russians did interfere. Interesting that Tillerson raised that this week. Interesting that President Trump still won't criticize President Putin. He was asked today at the press conference, President Trump, what is your relationship like with Vladimir Putin? And he basically pivoted away from Putin and said a lot of nice things about Xi Jinping. He said that he had good talks at Mar-a-Lago and again last evening on the phone about North Korea with Xi Jinping. And David's point I think is central here. It looks as if the United States has flipped. Now very open and praising China, very critical of Russia. The opposite of where president-elect Trump was during the transition. 

What about North Korea? What do you guys both see what our options are in North Korea because the president has said in some of these interviews he's done in the last couple of days, I'm sending an armada to the waters off North Korea. What do you make of that? 

Well, Charlie, I will just begin and then, leave it to Nick. I think Trump has pretty much told us the baseline, that he had extensive, he said four hours of one-on-one conversation with Xi Jinping. North Korea was a central part of that. I'm told that each explained how they look at this North Korea problem. Trump said it's intolerable for the United States to allow North Korea to get a nuclear tip missile that could strike American territory. If you don't help us deal with it, we will deal with it. I think Xi Jinping talked about how frustrating it is for China to deal with North Korea. What a difficult neighbor they are. So they talked it through, and then interestingly, after the visit, the Chinese have been unusually cooperative, they abstained in a U.N. vote on a Syria resolution, taking a different position from Russia. Trump said today in his news conference that China has already started turning around North Korean coal ships, exports that are crucial for the North Korean economy. Chinese issued a public press statement today basically warning North Korea, not warning Donald Trump, warning North Korea that the current situation of confrontation is intolerable to China. So it seems as if Trump has managed to pull Xi Jinping toward him in this crucial confrontation. Obviously, the Chinese want this to be resolved without military force, that'd be catastrophic for all of northeast Asia, but it's been a really interesting, surprisingly nuanced, to me, bit of diplomacy from a very inexperienced president who just until the summit with Xi Jinping, I'm not sure he ever had a meeting quite like that. 

Nick, I want you to comment on this, too, because you have been there. It is so interesting to me that the strike took place on Thursday night and Xi Jinping is having dinner with the man who ordered this strike. 

I think it must have stunned Xi Jinping a little bit, the way all of us were stunned, because of the astonishing speed of Donald Trump's decision between the use of sarin gas and those 59 cruise missiles heading for the air base in Syria. The Chinese must have thought, is Trump trying to signal us that he has some options on North Korea? 

Yes. 

I agree with David, Charlie, that President Trump is banking a lot on the Chinese here. The Chinese are very frustrated with Kim Jong-un and they have been for years. And the Chinese have begun to restrict coal exports to North Korea. They provide all the food and most of the energy, so they've got leverage. But I'm skeptical that President Trump is going to be any more successful than President Obama or President George W. Bush. I was part of the Bush effort ten years ago to try to get the Chinese to do more. At the end of the day, the Chinese I think are more comfortable with the status quo of a nuclear armed North Korea than the possible alternative, let's say the collapse of North Korea at some point, refugees into China, and a united Korea, democratic, based in Seoul, allied with the United States, that would border China. And I don't know if Donald Trump and Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson are going to be able to pierce that Chinese wall. They will give a little, they will say they are frustrated, they will lecture the North Koreans, but will they actually change a core Chinese position? I'm not sure that they will. 

David? 

Well, you know, Trump has presented the Chinese with an additional unsavory option which is that the U.S. would take unilateral military action on their border. That has got to be the least attractive of all. I have heard people in the Trump administration talk in a very general sort of way about the possibility that someday a different North Korea might be a buffer state between a strong South Korea aligned with the U.S. and China. The Chinese obviously fear a unified Korea, dominated by South Korea, would be in effect an American proxy on their border and threatening. So I think there is a little bit of creative thinking about some way to say that the Chinese, we understand that you have interests. We would be prepared to explore an outcome here that would recognize those interests and leave you feeling secure as opposed to insecure. 

Nick, you know more about this than I would obviously, again, but I am told that in terms of diplomacy, nothing makes another nation happier, especially if they are weaker, that is not true with respect to China, if they believe that you are listening to them, that their point of view is being heard. 

And it's interesting to see Donald Trump's first foray. I think this has been the most important two weeks of his presidency on foreign policy. He spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping. They didn't play golf together at Mar-a-Lago. They had long conversations. They had a lot of one-on-one time. In the phone call last night where they are checking in with each other about the latest steps on North Korea, it is a very good sign. Because I think we've learned over the last decade or two that China is two things to the United States. In a way, China is going to be our most important partner on big issues like North Korea and climate change, if the Trump administration would see its way forward on climate change. But it's also a competitor to the United States. A competitor for strategic and military power. And balancing that, requires real subtlety and sophistication and foreign policy. I think President Obama and President George W. Bush were able to keep the balance. And frankly, I think President Trump has had a good week dealing with Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago and again last night. And in his statements today, they were very admiring of Xi Jinping. They were supportive of a stronger relationship between the U.S. and China. And he really gave the back of his hand to Russia. Didn't want to talk about the Russia relationship. So let's hope that this ideological battle in the White House is really swinging towards people who know what they are talking about, our Secretary of State, our Secretary of Defense. 

David, have we made a choice, has this country made a choice as to whether it's going to go after ISIS and leave Assad alone except for the use of chemical weapons? Or do we have a larger strategy that includes doing, you know, not just simply getting rid of ISIS or minimizing ISIS, and then going after some transition in the Syrian government. 

Charlie, as near as I can tell from my reporting, the strategy remains pretty much what it was under Obama. And strategy is generous in implying clarity. But in eastern Syria, the United States will lead a coalition that will take the ISIS capital of Raqqa. The U.S. is going forward with a force that is led by Syrian-Kurdish elements who are good fighters, drives Turkey nuts, but the U.S. is pushing ahead with that. In terms of ultimate political balance in the west of Syria, in Damascus and Aleppo in the north and the cities in between, I think the U.S. continues to believe that a negotiated political settlement there that gets Bashar al-Assad out eventually, after a transition of some length is the only policy that makes sense. When I talk to senior commanders in the Pentagon, that is still what they tell me. I just, we'll see whether there are any progress was made by Rex Tillerson in his conversations with Putin about some effort between the United States and Russia to broker that transition. John Kerry tried it, admirably. He worked so hard on it under President Obama. Never really got it done. I think Trump is basically trying that again although they're not saying it. 

Yeah, but John Kerry always bemoaned the fact and did so to 51 diplomats at the State Department, that the U.S. has no leverage on the ground, so therefore, negotiations were very difficult. 

Well, They've got more. Fire 59 cruise missiles and you got a little more leverage. 

Do you think that is true with respect to the North Koreans? Do you think this was a shot that was heard around the world, that the United States intends to lead? 

I was just going to say, to build on David's point, Charlie, this was President Obama's point of weakness, where most people thought he lost American credibility, the failure to defend the red line in Syria. I do think President Trump earned a little bit of credibility last week with those air strikes. But it's going to be hard to proceed now because Rex Tillerson has been talking about a big negotiation to try to put, bring the parties in Syria together, and go for a transitional government and some kind of ceasefire. That could take years. He's right to try it. But I'm not sure we have the leverage on the ground. The Russians have leverage, they're far more powerful than we are in Syria. They've got the Iranians and Hezbollah and the Syrian government. I don't think Putin is gonna be pushed off that position. So, Tillerson is right to try. President Trump said today, it's time to end the war. But I'm not sure they've got the leverage to do it yet. It gets back to David's very good reporting, can the United States build these coalitions with fighters on the ground, whether the Syrian-Kurds or some Sunni militias, to get that leverage? 

Someone said to me that in the conversation between Rex Tillerson and Foreign Minister Lavrov, that Lavrov read out almost seven or eight examples where American intervention had come to nothing. 

Well, that's a standard Russian refrain. You Americans keep going in and blowing up countries without knowing what is going to come next. And look at the messes you've created. And I think we all understand there's a way in which that carries an important proof. I think in this case, Russia gained the strategic advantage when it intervened in Syria in September 2015. And has been in the driver's seat. And U.S. diplomacy has been bootless. It just hasn't had the clout to be effective. What I hear from the White House as they talk about what they are trying to do, is the idea that the U.S. by being more decisive, as Nick says, very quick, in two days responding to a chemical weapons attack, puts the Russians on their back foot a little bit. I quoted one official in a column this morning saying the Russians are catching for a change after, you know, pitching for so long. Now they're catching. Now they're responding. 

Yes, I saw that. 

So I think that tells you how they are looking at this. They want to make Russia own the Syria problem. Once Russia owns it, well, do they really want to stick with Bashar al-Assad? Is that really in their interest? That is the kind of conversation I think they want to have. 

David, one last question about the factional fighting. Is the life of Steve Bannon at the White House short lived? 

Well, when the president himself is as critical of Steve Bannon as he was last night in the television interview, and when unnamed White House officials say things as they have been to me and other journalists, criticizing Bannon for being selfish, egotistical, divisive, you know the knives are out. Does this have -- is there a way for Steve Bannon to reboot himself? I don't know. He's going to have to seat some crow, I would think, after what the president said, he's going to have to show, I'm a loyal team player, sir. But you know, we've entered a very different phase. He seemed to be, you know, high in the saddle a month ago and not so now. 

David, thank you so much. Nick Burns, thank you so much.
