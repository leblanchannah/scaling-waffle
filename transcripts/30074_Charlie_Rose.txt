We'll talk about that when we return. 

Anyone who needs proof of the changes that have taken place in the American family since World War II need only read journalist Donald Katz's new book, Home Fires. He has documented the turbulent unraveling of one family's suburban dream through their own recollections of the past 45 years. He joins us now with Ricky Gordon, a composer and one of the subjects of Home Fires. Welcome, Ricky. Welcome. 

Thank you. 

A pleasure. Tell me how this got started, the genesis of Home Fires. 

Ricky and I were jogging partners here in Riverside Park between 1983 and 1987. I was working on another book at the time. He was working on his operas. We told family stories to each other. I was always struck by how incredible it was that one family should've touched just about every cultural, political, economic, and dysfunctional experience that you could think of through a half century of American post-war history. 

Set the time. What was the time for that? 

The jogging was '83-'87. I heard the stories, and at one point five years later somebody said to Ricky, "What happened to your family, this family that started out -- The aspirations for Sam and Eve Gordon were to be a normal American family. They'd lived through the Depression. He survived the war. He was going to take his family to the suburbs in 1952 from the Bronx. Everything went awry." Ricky said, "The times." I remember thinking, "That's what the humanities is about." Is it the times? Is it history? Is it Freudian predisposition? Genetics? Family structure? 

Tell us what you did, though. Once you decided, what did you do? 

After I decided that it was a book, I started collecting the family stories. I spent four years creating this family as a chassis for the whole 50 years. I was basically doing two books for about two years. I was doing a whole social and political history of the post-war era, the whole sense of what the family experts were saying at the time, and then I was creating the intimate story of what happened in the Gordon household, which was quite dramatic. 

Tell me how you felt when this intruder comes in to document, to observe, to record. 

At first, I felt frightened. I felt like it might rob some of my work from me. I felt flattered. I felt a lot of the natural stuff, you know. It's like everybody wants to be famous, and in a book, and terrific. It was, I felt, myriad things, and so did my other family members. Nobody said yes right away, and that took a while. Like when Don first asked me, I went home to my parents, were living in Florida, and I kind of was the liaison and convinced everybody to do it. 

I think they all had different reasons. You know these are people who are particularly creative and aggressive. Through the whole era they are there at the front lines. Somebody is at Woodstock, at Altima. Somebody touches every spiritual movement, every drug is ingested, every possible familial combination occurs, and sexual adventure. It's just quite amazing, so I think they saw the book as the next step in their constant search for interpretive framework. 

For example, you say that the 60s counterculture claimed each of the kids in one way or the other. 

Yeah. 

Right? How so? 

Well, for example, my two older sisters, my sister Susan was a writer; present at many important events in the 60s, and so is my sister Lorraine, and she ended up getting married and having a kid at 17. 

Changing her name to Leila. 

Right she got into yoga and everything. 

Before having children that stem a need for this normal aspiration. They were named Rum, Shiva, Gopaul, and Magdalena Shapiro. 

Right. 

What was the struggle for both of you, and just jump in. What was the struggle to live up to the expectation of the American Dream? 

I think it was, in Sam and Eve's sense, when they came to this suburb, it's a poignant section in '52, they move with 250 other families on the same day from the Bronx to a new development on the south shore of Long Island; they really felt they'd arrived. The first man in his family to have a car, to have a house, and to have the promise land. 

They'd gotten their piece. 

They had gotten their piece, and all of the family troubles caused by things like the Depression, the War, by the immigration, it's multi-generational, the grandparents are in the book, too. This was over, and suddenly, by late 1956, Susan is going off to the earliest rock concerts in the movie palaces. An 11 year old Lorraine's toddling behind her. They were gone. 

What was the hardest thing for you? Were there defining moments in all of this? 

Yes, in terms of the book? 

Yeah. 

The hard thing is being exposed. You know, my sexuality. 

Tell me about it. 

Well, my homosexuality is in this book, and stuff about my drinking, drugs. I really had to decide that it can be, for me, a political stance to be truthful about who and what I am, and that's what I think is courageous about my family. That's all one has, I suppose, so I have my truth, and it's in the book, but it's scary for it to be out in the open for thousands of people to read. 

It may be pat, but it clearly changed your life. The book. 

Yes, it did. Definitely. 

In a positive way? 

Yes. 

Because it forced you to -- 

Confront a lot of things. Not only that, it changed my family's life. It made our family, I think, a lot closer. It brought, I've been with my sister Shelia a lot lately, and you relive a lot of your childhood memories. You relive everything in the genealogy of this book. 

Is there downside, though, here? 

Well, I was worried about the ramifications of presenting each of these members of a family with a document that purported to be their own life story from their own perspective. Everybody who knew and loved them, their teachers, their rabbis, their people who abandoned them. I think how would any of us react to that, but they handled it. 

Let me give you an example. I mean, what I've thought about when I thought about this concept. Bob Woodward from the Washington Post has said, "Listen, you know, this paper for example, wouldn't like for somebody to come in and, I wouldn't like for somebody to come in and examine my life, the way I examine other people's life as a reporter." You know, and here, your lives are examined ending up here, for everybody to know. Following, talk to 'em, told them stories, and that's have, in some cases -- 

I think at this point, they realize, it's helping other people. People see themselves in this book. There's something about taking a real story, people know it's a real family, setting it up against a sense of the times, which we all lived to. There's a healing capacity to it. 

It had to be nonfiction? It had to be a real family? It had to be identified? You had to have that grim, I mean, that edge of reality? Well, grim was the wrong word, I would say. 

No, it had to be real. 

The grim reality. 

Edge of reality. 

It's an important point. Nonfiction has to kind of - No, I think right now, the culture demands real stories. People are looking for their own interpretations in real life. Look at the culture of meetings, 12 steps, daytime television, real life television. Nonfiction's very powerful, and that's why, you know, - 

Can you ever leave the Gordons? 

In some ways I feel like I'm part of the family, and I'm looking forward to the next era, which is that I can just be their friend. 

You won't be writing about the next generation? 

I won't. 

(inaudible) more interviews. 

No more interviews, and I do think that they communicated with each other through this book, too, by telling me things they hadn't told each other. I think there was a component. 

It also contributed to our work. I mean, all Don heard about, a lot of these stories because I was writing an opera about my family. I won the National Institute for Music Theater award for this piece, and it really feeds one's work, because no matter how much you ask your own family what happened, they never tell one another the way they all seem to blab to Don.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thanks, and congratulations.
