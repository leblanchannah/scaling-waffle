Alison Stewart:Good evening. I'm Alison Stewart filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with politics. President Trump delivered a highly anticipated address to a joint session of congress last night. He defended his administration's first five weeks in office, and vowed to reach across party lines to achieve legislative goals including rebuilding the nation's highways and roads. 

Donald Trump:If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. (APPLAUSE) Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program, the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. (APPLAUSE) 

Alison Stewart:The tone and content of last night's speech marked a reversal from the dire landscape that the president articulated during his inaugural address in January. 

Donald Trump:A new chapter -- (APPLAUSE) -- of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. 

Alison Stewart:The question for many is which President Trump should we expect moving forward? Joining me now from Washington is David Rennie, he is Washington bureau chief and Lexington columnist for "The Economist;" also in Washington is Ed O'Keefe, he's a congressional reporter for "The Washington Post;" and here with me in New York is Megan Murphy, she's editor in chief of "Bloomberg Business Week," the latest issue of the magazine profiles top Trump advisor Stephen Miller. Welcome to all of you. We have had 24 hours to digest this speech. So David, I want to throw to you first. Obviously, the president was physically speaking in front of Congress, but he was spiritually and sort of psychologically reaching out to his base. What did he say that made them happy, made them know they supported the right candidate? 

David Rennie:That's exactly the right question to ask. And I found myself watching the speech last night waiting to hear details finally filled in on how he's going to sort of fund that infrastructure he talks about, you know, what will be his tax plan? When those details didn't come, and I realized that I guess people like us who are trying to work out what Donald Trump's agenda is, are still disappointed. We don't know. I then was asking, how come his supporters who I meet out when I go to rallies and political meetings, how come they are so absolutely certain that he is keeping his promises and they're so happy that he is doing what he said he would do. And it occurred to me that what's really going on, I think, is that we in Washington, or you in New York, we're very focused on what politicians do. Donald Trump's genius is to be the guy who can tell you who he is doing it for. He's standing for his people. Last night he broadened the frame of it to being he's the guy who represents the champion for all American citizens who will put American citizens ahead of foreigners, ahead of illegal immigrants, ahead of kind of global rivals who are trying to do America down. He will tell you who he's for. We're still wanting to know what he's for. And I think that explains all the gap. 

Alison Stewart:Megan, let's talk about what wasn't covered in the speech last night. We didn't hear about climate change. We didn't hear about economic inequality. What was a glaring omission for you and why? 

Megan Murphy:We should give a quick shout-out to clean air and clean water. 

Alison Stewart:As we're talking about the EPA. 

Megan Murphy:I think we have to be honest, in that, this was a good moment for him. He had two objectives last night. He wanted to reset his image with the American people and he wanted to reset his image with his own party. He's got some incredibly difficult battles to fight ahead in terms of getting his legislative agenda ahead. And David is exactly right, while we don't know details, we do know getting forward a comprehensive tax reform plan, getting forward Affordable Care Act repeal and replace and what's going on with Obamacare is going to be very difficult. I think in terms of the omission, in terms of where he could have and should have done more, was number one on fleshing out the details of the things that could have been a very easy win for him and I think a bipartisan win. 

Alison Stewart:For example. 

Megan Murphy:One of those is infrastructure. You showed a little bit of a clip there. But when you look at this administration, you look at some of the missteps and mistakes they've had which has been immense. One of them is obviously the immigration order rollout and the refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. But, I think, when you look back and you look back at the early days of this Trump presidency, if he turns out to be a relatively unsuccessful president in getting his agenda sent forward, one would be he missed this opportunity to really put the screws on the wheels. Everyone is calling for infrastructure reform. He would have put his own party, in terms of a really true stimulus budget forward and put them in a difficult place to reject it, and really started on something that could have been a bipartisan move forward for him. I think that was a bit of -- again, not to press it harder last night. 

Alison Stewart:Ed, two weeks ago, you and I were sitting here discussing that 77 minute rollicking press conference. Now the speech we saw last night, it felt like to me that it was candidate Trump's stump speech put through an auto tune, right? You know, that's the program that record producers use to sort of smooth out the edges and get people back on pitch. Did you hear anything new and different? 

Ed O'keefe:Well, I think his general approach and the fact that he was able to come into that room, command it, and deliver a state of the union like address proves that this is somebody who, at least to nervous Republicans, is capable of at least appearing presidential and delivering and laying out an agenda. The specifics be damned at this point. You know, I did hear a little more specificity, not much, but a little bit more about sort of where they want to go on Obamacare, where they want to go on tax reform. He did not get into discussion of immigration reform in ways that he has privately now twice in the last two weeks with senators and with news anchors talking about the idea of a broader immigration bill. And part of the reason we didn't hear more about infrastructure spending, frankly, is because the biggest most important audience he had to address there last night and to impress, I don't think was the American public. It was those hundreds of Republicans in the room who for the last several weeks with little guidance from the White House, have been squabbling amongst themselves about how exactly to do a new health-care system in this country, about how exactly to reform the tax system, how to pay for a border wall, and a host of other issues. And so the fact that he didn't get into the issues where he might be able to find some more bipartisan accord wasn't just because Democrats right now aren't in the mood to work with him and don't feel that he's done anything to win them over, but also because the next few months for him and for Republicans are probably going to be the most critical of the last four years because this is their one and only opportunity to prove that they can actually govern and make changes after years of threatening to do so if they ever had power. 

Alison Stewart:David, we did not hear about Aleppo. We didn't hear about Moscow. Why not? 

David Rennie:Foreign policy was kind of amazingly absent. We had some warmish words about NATO. We had, as you say, I think the auto tune analogy is pretty good. We had a hint of the sort of nationalist suspicion of international organizations where he talked about sovereign states. He talked about free nations being able to decide their own fate. It was interesting that when I checked the European press today for their reactions, one of the big French papers, "La Monde," picked up on that and said that sounded to them like an attack on the European Union. It's those kinds of things that make people very jumpy among America's allies. But I think in terms of Russia, it's one of the many areas where it's not just that Donald Trump has kind of controversies that he wants to wish away. I think one of the fascinating things about this 40 days of rollout is there's an open question, does Donald Trump actually enjoy the kind of hard grind of governing, the hard grind of detail, of tackling these complex subjects, or is that actually not his comfort zone? I think that's one of the unanswered questions, too. 

Megan Murphy:I think it's pretty clear that the hard grind of governing is not something that he feels is his strong suit. Basically, last night's address was pretty much a, here's what I want in terms of overarching promises and let's let the detail be worked out. Please come together in some type of magical way, and get forward some of these incredibly difficult agenda items. But I think David is exactly right there. What he's shown over these first few weeks is that is always going to be a little bit of a mountain with this administration in general. And they, frankly, don't have the organization and, so far, the internal discipline to push through these incredibly difficult challenges they have ahead like Obamacare, like tax reform, like getting anything done, needing still votes from the Senate from the Democratic side. 

Alison Stewart:Ed, one of the things that I've heard was Donald Trump is an interesting entity in to himself. He is not a traditional Republican. You heard the tepid applause about infrastructure and paid family leave. He's also, obviously, not a favor of the Democrats. So at this point, is his uniqueness, is it an issue for him or is it an issue for the congress going forward in terms of getting anything done? 

Ed O'keefe:I don't think we know that yet. And I know in this day and age we want answers to this stuff and we want to see results quickly. But, you know, we really need to strap in for I think at least nine months of intense activity on the Hill trying to sort this stuff out. It's going to take a little while. We're not going to see a lot of movement on this very quickly. Simply because these things take time and as the president learned last week, you know, healthcare is a complicated thing. Well, yeah, it took more than a year for Democrats in the Obama administration to put this thing together. To try to cobble it together in a new way is going to take just as long most likely. And how do you do that while you also want to tackle tax reform and immigration and all this other stuff. We just don't know yet. And I think Megan and David are both correct in that we haven't seen much yet from Trump on whether or not he really is into the art of governing, and whether his administration is capable of it. Now that you have cabinet secretaries essentially in place across the different agencies that would be affected by these big changes, the question is how do they build out their teams and their policy and work with these committees in the next few months? But this is going to take a little time. We're not really going to be able to measure the success of him and where he fits into the two-party dynamic, I think, for a little while longer. I think we have to really put aside though talk of lofty immigration and infrastructure work and paid parent, you know, paid leave for taking care of children, or sick parents, because they have to get that other stuff done first and it's going to take a while. And whether they can hold together really does remain a big unknown. There was a meeting today at the White House between top Republican leaders and the president to talk about how they put together that healthcare plan. How they sell it not only to the country but to themselves. And then, how do they work on those tricky things like paying for the border wall and where exactly that border wall would go. Remember, much of the opposition to that on Capitol Hill isn't from Democrats, necessarily, it's from border state Republicans, and border district Republicans, congressional Republicans who represent that 2,000 miles of border. They're concerned about this. There's going to have to be modifications. And it's going to be really difficult for this president to sort it out. 

David Rennie:I just wanted to jump in, when you were talking about the fact that he sometimes stands a bit like a Democrat on things like paid family leave, or you know, some of his views on not wanting tackle and title and reform. One of the things that's very striking, and I've been covering American politics this time around for five years, but before that my posting was covering European politics. He doesn't sound that unusual or that unfamiliar in the European frame. That mix of lots of spending on law and order, on the military, on the border but preserving pensions for old people, preserving welfare for your old kind of white voters, that mix is basically the far right nationalist French mix. For example, what we're going to see in the French elections with someone like Marine Le Pen. His agenda, the whole spectrum of anti-immigrants, willing to spend lots of money on old people, but lots of money on law and order, that's basically the Front National in France, that's -- in the Netherlands, he's very much an economic blood and soil nationalist in the European style. 

Megan Murphy:In talking about the economics, I mean, I think that's also the one thing what that when we talk about will be maybe something that was another bit of own goal last night. I mean, David is exactly right and saying his agenda is very much straight out of Marine Le Pen. But when he talk about inheriting a mess of an economy, when you talk about a number, like 94 million people out of work, that number just isn't true. When he talks about sort of sets the standard for himself of boosting growth to say two percent under the Obama administration up to, you know, three percent, four percent, even some Republicans talk about five percent through stripping out regulation, through tax reform, et cetera. That is also something that people are going to look back over time, overlooking back at this administration and saying did you actually keep those promises to voters? So much of his agenda is built on this nationalist economic agenda of returning manufacturing, of creating more jobs, of bringing back a traditional American economic base that people think it is. So many of the issues we have economically are due to structural displacement, automation, an incredibly aging workforce, a workforce that works in different ways that has different kinds of shift jobs where women's labor force participation remains a huge challenge for us. And I think that there will be a view that he was much too blase about the challenges of taking us from say a two percent to a four percent growth. And his economic agenda is still so focused on top down. We saw Dow 21,000 today. And there's no question that Wall Street and the titans of industry viewed this speech very favorably. The irony is, those people who were most likely to back him, white working class voters from the rust belt from Michigan, from Ohio, from Wisconsin, those are people who are yet to benefit from that huge increase in the market, from these kinds of policies. And if he doesn't make good on that, that's going to be a big problem for him and a big problem for the Republican Party. 

Alison Stewart:Ed, the president talked about civilians and had guests in the audience. And one thing that struck me is out of the four people he talked to, two were African-Americans, talked about, the young woman who had the school choice, and the gentleman whose son was killed by an undocumented person in this country. Donald Trump only got eight percent of the African-American vote, what was that stagecraft about? 

Ed O'keefe:It's about improving those numbers. You know, Republicans for years have worked at this, believing that, you know, it was Jeb Bush who used to say -- I covered his campaign -- he's say, you know, he quoted Ronald Reagan, that most Americans are conservative. They just don't realize it yet. This is a Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer obsession for when they ran the Republican national committee. And Trump himself is interested in doing it. He believes that if given a chance and people heard him out that he would win them over, we'll see. He has done nothing to help himself, frankly, among Hispanics, among Latinos in this country, given how he's talked about and what he has done regarding immigration in recent weeks. You notice he didn't invite any Latinos to sit up there in the balcony. Denisha Merriweather was the woman who was there as sort of the emblem of school choice, again, another person that Jeb Bush traveled with during his campaign. And she's really a symbol for many Republicans of the benefits and the success, the potential of school choice which is a big concern of the presidents, and something that he'll be talking about on Friday at a catholic school in Orlando. But, yes, they're definitely trying to broaden the appeal to do what he can, to win over African-Americans, and Latino voters, and union households, and to just find ways to continue to cut in to the Democratic diasporas. But as polling has borne-out in the early days of this presidency, he's not making much of a dent despite his attempts. 

Alison Stewart:That was a spending speech as they say in my house. How is all this going to get paid for? 

Megan Murphy:Well, that's the big question, isn't it? And with little flesh on the bones to actually get this detail. One thing that has been talked about and is constantly talked about is this border tax, adjustment tax, which is projected to raise one trillion. You're already seeing huge mobilization against it. This is the tax wall. The corporate tax rate would drop down to 20 percent, which is something they've been trying to do for years. You also would put basically a bigger levy on imports. You would encourage American manufactures to keep jobs, keep production at home, and you discourage them from importing goods from abroad. The problem is there's a huge section of the American economy, whether that's retailers, whether that's oil refineries that import these materials. And that would be, in particular in the retail sector, really deadly. They've already mobilized against it. They're already running ads against it. I mean, this is a cornerstone of the Paul Ryan tax plan to get this one trillion through to fund a lot of these initiatives. The problem is that it's already is looking a little bit dead on arrival. Donald Trump's own administration can't seem to agree, between Steve Bannon, between Gary Cohn from Goldman Sacs, and Steve Mnuchin who are ardently against it, versus Bannon's wing who seems to be for it. So, look, it is very difficult to come up with the money. You may look at his military spending, taking that up, again, that's hugely divisive within his own party, let alone the Democratic Party. His budget looks dead on arrival. So, look, it was a good night for him. It was a good speech given the very low expectations, frankly, that were out there. He jumped over the bar and he jumped over the bar quite cleanly. The tax of getting this agenda through, welcome to Washington, game on, but let's see whether or not he's actually gonna be able to forge any type of agreement within his own party, let alone getting some support he needs across the aisle to get this stuff through. 

Alison Stewart:Megan's identified -- 

Ed O'keefe:Hey, Alison. 

Alison Stewart:Yes, go ahead. 

Ed O'keefe:To Megan's point, it's going to be all about how to pay for these things. And that is why the next few months are going to be really tricky for Republicans. It's going to be a real test of his patience. And I think may further expose whether he is in some ways embracing conservative orthodoxy, especially on fiscal issues, or whether he is just like, no, screw it, let's just spend this money and the rest of you who are concerned about this be damned. If that happens, there's at least two, maybe three dozen house Republicans certainly who have said they're willing to stand up and start blocking things if they need to. 

Alison Stewart:David, last word here? 

David Rennie:I think another really interesting thing about Donald Trump which we learned during the campaign, I interviewed him a couple of times and this came up. He is a guy who does not like to admit that there might be painful tradeoffs. So I asked him about things like what it happens if prices go up in Walmart, at the time it wasn't about border adjustment, it was about if he slaps tariffs on Chinese imports. And I said to him, you know, a lot of your voters, they go to Walmart. What will they do when those prices go up? And he did not want to admit that there would be a tradeoff. So what he said to me at the time was, oh, you know, maybe my guys they go and buy three dolls for their daughter, maybe they'll just go and buy one doll for their daughter, but they'll have a great job, so everyone will be happy, no? And I think what that showed you that at least as a campaigner he liked to think that everything could be kind of resolved to everyone's satisfaction and that he would be able to avoid painful tradeoffs. Well, Washington is a town where tradeoffs are the kind of the air that we breathe. 

Alison Stewart:This is to be continued is what I'm hearing you all say. David Rennie from the Economist, Ed O'Keefe from the Washington Post, and Megan Murphy from Bloomberg Business Week, thanks, everybody. 

Ed O'keefe:Thank you. 

David Rennie:Thank you. 

Alison Stewart:"Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812" is the new hit Broadway musical now playing at the Imperial Theater. The musical is inspired from a passage from Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece, "War and Peace." "The New York Times" calls the great comic: "The most innovative and the best new musical to open on Broadway since Hamilton." Here's a look. (MUSIC AND SINGING) (SINGING) The great comet of 1812... The brilliant comet of 1812... (APPLAUSE) Joining me now is the writer and composer, Dave Malloy, and two of the stars of the show, Natasha -- Denee Brenton, and Pierre -- Josh Groban. Hi, guys, thanks for being on the show. So you wrote this based on a 70 page sliver -- you can say 70 pages is a sliver of "War and Peace" -- what in your mind went from the story of "War and Peace" to musical theater. How did you make that bridge? 

Dave Malloy:I really had an epiphany as I was reading the section. Like, it wasn't something that came to me years later. It was as I was reading, and specifically this section -- got to the end of the section where Pierre has this incredible moment with a comet and tears were dripping down my face. And, yes, I just had this epiphany of what I just read was a perfect musical. It was a perfect musical. It was a perfect piece of musical theater. And I think at that time I diligently went and like Googled to make sure that no one else had done it because I couldn't believe that no one else had done it because it is such a perfect story. And I loved the way that the story in particular kind of paralleled these two very different stories, this is one, you know, young romantic story, and this other like middle-aged angst philosophical story, and the way that those two ran in parallel and that they collide only at the very end, it just felt like such a musical to me. 

Alison Stewart:Tell me a little bit about the story for folks who haven't seen it, so that they can understand our whole conversation. 

Dave Malloy:Sure. So, yes, there are these two tales. So Natasha is young, which is one of the lyrics in the first song, and she is newly engaged to this man Andre, who's off fighting in the war. And so she is visiting her godmother in Moscow, and kind of being introduced to Moscow society while she's waiting for her fiancee. And while she is waiting, she meets a notorious young rogue named Anatole and then hijinks ensue. And meanwhile, an old family friend of theirs, Pierre. (CROSSTALK) 

Alison Stewart:Tell me about Pierre. What's going on with Pierre? 

Josh Groban:Well, there's all this vanity and narcissism happening as you said in this Moscow society where there is war outside the gates and everybody is just concerned about the high society, the balls, and the opera, and all that. Pierre is searching for meaning in his life. He's, you know, he's I think a little bit of a depressive. He drinks a lot as he mentions many times in the lyrics. And he's searching for some kind of meaning after having been thrust into wealth. He's got this unexpected money. He's married somebody who he is very attracted to, but knows doesn't love him very much. And so, you know, while everybody is at war with either Napoleon or society, Pierre is at war with himself, and so there is this wonderful arc and wonderful songs that are so, so gratifying to sing as Pierre. And so, yes, I think we all see a little bit of ourselves in these characters. 

Alison Stewart:Now I didn't fact check this, but I'm guessing that you have been offered Broadway roles before. 

Josh Groban:I have been. 

Alison Stewart:Given your success as a singer. You saw this in a sort of -- one of the incarnations, smaller incarnation -- even off-Broadway, in the West Ville in the meat packing district. What made you realize, OK, this is the one that I'm going to make the leap. I'm going to take the leap and go to Broadway. 

Josh Groban:I was a fan of this show off-Broadway. I came to see it in the Tent Casino downtown in the meat packing district. And I walked out of there, first and foremost just totally transfixed by Dave's score. I thought this was a genre bending, complicated but beautiful score that just hit all my buttons as a muso. And then just the story felt so relevant to me. It felt relevant to me then, but it felt even more relevant now as we look at things that are going on in the world and the way we all are trapped in our own little screens, in our own little worlds and searching for meanings in our own lives now. I have been offered things in the past. But this to me seemed something unique, it seemed to me like it would be something that Broadway hasn't ever seen before. And I knew it would be a challenge to me. This is a role that is very different than the kind of person I generally am in my life. Me and Pierre have a lot of differences, some similarities, but also some differences. And so, I thought to myself, yes, this was worth the wait. I've read somewhere that they were thinking of bringing it to a proscenium and I thought, you know, what the heck, I'm going to reach out and see if it feels right. And Dave and Rachel, our wonderful director and I went out for one or five drinks and we talked it over, and it was a natural fit. Glad I waited. 

Alison Stewart:Denee, about three years ago you were just getting ready to graduate from Carnegie Melon. 

Denee Benton:Yes. 

Alison Stewart:And you think about where you are now. Can you think about a moment or a decision you made that really steered you toward this time in your life? 

Denee Benton:That's a really good question. Not quite to the extreme, but I had an opportunity to leave school early for a different job. And I wouldn't have been able to graduate. And I've always been a very ambitious person, so opportunities like this is where my dreams were set. And so I waited. And then the right opportunity came along where I would be able to graduate and my college also still introduced me to representation, agents and managers that would help me sort of take my steps into the industry. And I think those little decisions there really helped me get into the right rooms because as an actor, getting seen is the trick, right, getting the audition. And so I got very fortunate with the people that I got connected with in the industry. And from there, it was sort of you just kind of wait for the right opportunity and you're putting yourself out there and doing your absolute best. And a role like Natasha comes along. And I think every female at my age would kill to play a role like this. It's so complex, it's so rich. She's the archetype, she's the ingÃ©nue, and she's also dealing with coming of age as a woman for the first time in her life, which I feel very connected with her there. I feel very similarly, we were kind of dealing with these things of what it means to be a woman in our current societies and all of those things. So I feel very fortunate to get to connect with a character so deeply. And also for the material to be perfect, you know. So, yes, I think that answers your question. 

Alison Stewart:Well, I would love for people to hear your beautiful voice. Let's take a listen to a clip of Natasha sort of in one of those times in her life when she is just overcome by love, sort of laced with lust. This is Denee Benton in "The Great Comet of 1812." (SINGING) First time I heard your voice... Moonlight burst into the room... And I saw your eyes... And I saw your smile... And the world opened wide... And the world was inside of me... And I catch my breath... And I laugh and blush... And I hear guitars... You are so good for me... I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you... I love you... Dave, I'm curious about your decision about -- 

Dave Malloy:You look good in blue. 

Alison Stewart:Your decision about what this would sound like, because there are so many different kinds of sound. There's sort of like a steampunk craziness, rock 'n' roll. At one point, I was like, I went to that club. I remember that club in the '90s. And then those beautiful ballads as well. How did you decide how to balance it and what would go where? 

Dave Malloy:Totally. Honestly, I think that's one of the things that drew me to Tolstoy so much is that like, "War and Peace," it is such an all-encompassing novel, like he has the Tsar and Napolean are just characters in his novel then and he has Bellago, who is like this lowest peasant driver. And like, my approach to music is exactly the same. I grew up on '60s and '70s rock 'n' roll, and then I became a jazz snob and then I became a classical snob and then I found out about electronic music, and then I found out about like Bjork and Radiohead, so I always just included all of that in my musical palate. And so yeah in looking at "War and Peace," I said this is perfect, because I get to flex all of these muscles. I really get to do this. When Natasha is singing a love song in a Broadway musical, like that wants to feel like a real Rogers &amp; Hammerstein sort of old-school, Broadway love song, but then when they go to the club and they're all drinking vodka, it can be like raucous house music. I think that is what I loved about the book so much that it gave me the opportunity to do all these different things and to not put myself into a certain box and say, this has to be all Russian music or all folk music or all whatever it is. 

Josh Groban:I feel like so many of the characters have their own genre almost attached to them. I feel like you've also written like so much of the electronic is for Anatole. He comes out and it becomes this, you hear the subwoofers going when he is out there. 

Denee Benton:He is the heartthrob, right. 

Alison Stewart:Yeah. He's the one who ruins Natasha. 

Dave Malloy:He literally electrifies the room. That was actually like a dramaturgical discovery in writing the show. Originally, some of the earlier stuff had electronic music in it as well, but as I wrote more and more of it, I started to realize, oh, all of Anatole's songs are electronic. That could be a thing. So then so now his entrance he brings electronica into the room. 

Alison Stewart:With you and Rachel, you worked together and one of the things about the show that has sent critics running for their thesaurus to describe it is, because it is unusual and unique and vibrant. Was there any creative decision that you folks wanted to make. People said they can't do that. But you said we're going to do that. 

Dave Malloy:No, I mean we have been blessed with incredible producers all along the way. This show started at this very small theater, 87 seats I think it was, called Aris Nova. And you know, I immediately thought that they would shoot down the entire idea, like oh it was my first piece with them. Maybe let's do something more small and reasonable. I said "War and Peace" and they said yeah, let's do it, then our producers, Howard and Jana and many others who brought us first to the tent, they insisted that we not just transfer to a proscenium house, that we kind of keep the small intimacy that we had. And then we went to ART in Boston. That was like another step along the way and we knew if we had on our eyes on Broadway, we had to figure out how it would work in a proscenium house, but we didn't want to concede and just go, ok, we'll just do a proscenium production. It was essential to us that we keep the heart of the show in tact so we have this kind of intimacy and this kind of 360-degree surround. So then ART was a huge step in that in terms of they helped us figure out how to put this immersive show into a proscenium house. 

Alison Stewart:Sounded like people wanted to help you to be as creative as possible. 

Dave Malloy:Yeah, it was wonderful. 

Alison Stewart:Let's talk about that 360. For people who are watching this at home, I suggest go look at clips online because as being in the audience, you can be sitting on the stage or part of the show, the cast is everywhere, they are in the aisles. I'm wondering for you because your character, he is suicidal at some point. He sings in very, he is going through such an emotional thing and you're singing these songs and Lois and Rogers from Great Neck are right here. What is it like for you? They're great. What is that like for you to have to do that right in the middle of the audience? 

Josh Groban:It made an already vulnerable new adventure for me, even more naked. Coming back into the acting world after you know leaving it kind of essentially for many years. I was at a fork in the road. Denee and I both went to Carnegie Melon University. I did take the job during my freshman year, she waited all the way to the fourth. But flexing the acting muscle again was something that I knew going to be like getting back on a bike am and I was grateful for Rachel's unbelievable guidance and direction for me. One of the things she made sure I did during rehearsals was be as uncomfortable as possible as much as possible. She placed people in the rehearsal rooms for me to make eye contact with during my songs, friends, crew members came in to help out, just to get us used to the idea that eyes were going to keep us honest at all times. And so even when there are those moments when you feel like you are throwing your heart and soul out onto the stage, you are doing it while being face to face with people. And your performance changes sometimes night by night based on the looks you get, the responses you get because you are basically telling your story both to people out in the house, you have to project, but at the same time you are telling it very cinematically to people right in front of you, so it was a terrifying endeavor to get used to that. Now I think we look forward to it, now that we have done 150 or so, we can't wait to see who is coming in from where and we can't wait to present that to them each night. 

Alison Stewart:What's that experience been like for you to be so close? 

Denee Benton:I sort of use them as an acting cool. You know, I sort of treat them -- because Natasha's going through such a sort of, such an arc, an archetypal arc I think, and she, I kind of use them as my diary. It's funny, there are people like Anatole comes in and they are trying to send me messages not to choose him and some women are like, yeah. And it is interesting. I have at the last scene I do, it's like you're weeping. And it almost helps to have people so with you in that moment. And for me it helps with the vulnerability. You feel so exposed that those emotions that you sort of need to come up with tell the story, I find it actually helpful. I can't really imagine doing it now with just us on stage and them out there. I feel like I wouldn't understand how to tell the story because they are so a part of it. It keeps me active. 

Josh Groban:Their energy -- 

Dave Malloy:I was going to say, one of our most clever things I think we've done is that we have managed to have a cast of 1200 people in our show, because we actually have a cast as big as Tolstoy's book, because you see the audience reacting. One of my favorite moments in the show is watching that song we just saw, "No One Else." And watching a 14-year-old girl watch you sing that song and then watching like a 70-year-old woman watch you sing that song, and they have such different life experiences. It's so beautiful. 

Denee Benton:You really take from that, I desperately use that, especially you know, in theater you are doing the same show eight shows a week and you sort of have been given the gift of freshness because you kind of have to stay honest. 

Josh Groban:It is the X factor. And for Pierre who sits in his study and gets to watch sometimes, it's so great for my prep going into the scenes to be able to watch the interaction, feel out what the energy of the room is each night because it is different every night. It definitely keeps you on your feet. 

Alison Stewart:I want to let the audience take a look and listen to you in the role of Pierre. Let's take a look. (SINGING) But when we fall in love, we wake up... And we are a god and angels weep... But if I die here tonight... I die in my sleep... (MUSIC) They say we are asleep until we fall in love... And I'm so ready... To wake up now... I want to wake up... Don't let me die while I'm like this... I want to wake up... God, don't let me die while I'm like this... Please let me wake up now... God, don't let me die while I'm like this... One thing that is interesting about this play, one of the many things interesting about the musical is that it has a multi-racial cast, and Denee, you have been very I think mature about this, because I think you've gotten a lot of, a lot of discussion about the fact that you are a black woman playing a Russian princess. And I follow you on Instagram. I know you really embrace this discussion of inclusion and diversity in the theater. You could have just said, I'm an actress, I'm playing a part. Why did you decide to really sort of decide to take part in this discussion? 

Denee Benton:It's interesting. I mean, it doesn't really seem like there's another option for me. I think I'm just naturally really interested in those topics. But beside that, it's not really like a trendy topic for me. It's my livelihood, having the opportunity to be a working actor in successful shows is a right I think anyone should have if you've worked hard enough for it. And so for me I think understanding what it was like to be a 12-year-old, an 11-year-old-girl desperately wanting to be a part of these stories and not seeing myself and the toll that that took on my self-esteem and my confidence. I think having the opportunity to be in the position where I know little girls might be watching and kind of wanting to save them some of that drama and be a part of what it is like to really articulate and use the vocabulary of Euro centric beauty standards and understanding why you might feel left out of the narrative. And I think it's special, because outside of the fact that Natasha is Russian, she is an archetype of beauty and light and love and everything that a girl goes through. And I think it's important to have archetypes actually look like the every-woman. And you don't have to look like Tom Hanks to be the every-man. The every-man looks like Dave. He looks like the Asian man down the street. And so I think that was important to me. Because I think we have a power to really normalize people and kind of heal a lot of the divisions that exist in our nation, by telling the truth and representing a truthful world. And when you have Tolstoy -- I heard Dave had a dramaturgical reason for it, because every type of person is represented, every type of Russian person is represented in "War and Peace." So what does that look like in an American landscape to have every type of person represented on an American stage for our audiences? So I thought that was a really cool explanation, outside of my own personal reasons of wanting representation for women of color. There was a dramaturgical reason for it as well. 

Alison Stewart:One of the things also that is interesting to me, and I'm curious if it's had an impact on the show, is that there are a great number of people in the cast for whom this is their Broadway debut, you two, your two leads, has that had an impact on the show, on its energy? 

Dave Malloy:I feel like the energy amongst like everyone is just so happy to be there. 

Denee Benton:We're such noobs, we're like what's tech, what's happening? 

Dave Malloy:A few of the people who have been with the show for the longest time are just old, old friends of mine who I kind of tricked into doing a show, at this little theater. They were not really actors at all. Brittain Ashford and Gelsey Bell are two women who are amazing singer/songwriters who I have known for many years. I asked them to do this show and now four or five years later they find themselves on a Broadway stage, like what, I didn't even audition for this. That sense of every one of us is so lucky to be here. 

Josh Groban:We all had moments of real emotional, like it gets you at points you don't expect. When we first started to walk into the theater and we're seeing the set being built and we were looking up and it wasn't even polished yet and things weren't on the walls yet, and you know, Rachel would say, you know, that is mark right there, that is where you are going to sing that solo. And you just go, you look at it under construction and it hits you because I think for so many of us we've dreamed of this moment. We've been thinking about it even if our careers have taken us into, Brittain and Gelsey, myself into music and other avenues, or we've been in school or whatever it is, like the dream of having this moment has been the same for so many of us. So there isn't a moment where we don't walk out there and just have absolute gratitude for this opportunity, it's incredible. 

Alison Stewart:It would be easy to just talk about the fantastic sets and the big sounds and the amazing costumes. But my last question for you is, what is the small thing that is moving to you about this story? Because you could get just lost in the spectacle of it. There is something very emotional about this. What moves you about this story? 

Josh Groban:Well, I mean, it is interesting, as the show has gotten everyone bigger and bigger throughout the years, we all looked at what it is now. We thought, well, this is very Tolstoy. We are very lucky especially in the realm of musical theater we get to have that spectacle and we get to give people that. But I think the core, the thing that brings tears to all of our eyes every night and hopefully audience members as well is I think the essence of what makes people happy and satisfied in their life is told through these characters in very, very different ways, but they ultimately I think by the end of it, come to the same conclusion about what it is that gives people vitality and happiness in their life. And for me, the thing that is the most powerful is for Pierre and Natasha's ending is that they are both at their absolute lowest when they finally connect after all these scenes of frivolity. And I think that that is something that I think in my own life as the circus swirls around you and you search for those meetings, we all know what that feels like to have dark moments and to search for those meanings, is to notice that that vulnerability is sometimes when you find the real path. And I think that is the main story that I take away from Pierre with the show that has always meant the most to me about the show. 

Alison Stewart:Denee, what moves you about the show? 

Denee Benton:I think for me it's the grace that the characters offer each other at the end. It's like they make terrible decisions. And they break people's hearts and they break their own hearts and sort of at a place where forgiveness might not come easily. And even in the entirety of the book of the characters that do these terrible things, and you end up seeing their humanity. There was a talk-back with kids yesterday and they were like, it's hard because I like Natasha but she makes bad decisions, and I don't know how to feel about her, and I was like, that's kind of like life, you know? It's kind of like life and the people that you love. And the grace that they offer each other in the end and they see the humanity in each other and he reminds her that she is still worth something. That gets me every time, because you make those decisions that you think you ruined your life and someone tells you that you are still worth it and you worth another chance. I think that is just magnificent. 

Dave Malloy:One of the arcs of the show is that we do try to trick our audience. They will show a lot of the show is this big spectacle and amazing music and choreography and all these things happening. At the heart of the show is a spoken exchange between two human beings. He just says something to Natasha and she hears it. And like that is the moment that transforms their lives it is not all the other things, so that has always felt so essential to me. 

Alison Stewart:The show is "Natasha and Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812." Dave Malloy, Denee Benton, and Josh Groban, thank you so much for being here. Congratulations. 

Josh Groban:Thank you so much. 

Dave Malloy:Thank you. 

Denee Benton:Thanks for having us. 

Alison Stewart:The film "Moonlight" is an intimate portrait of three distinct moments in the life of a young black man as he comes to terms with his sexuality and struggles to find his identity while growing up in a Miami housing project. It is an adaptation of Tarell McCraney's play, In Moonlight, Black Boys Look Blue. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, second only to "La La Land," another season-long Oscar favorite. In a dramatic turn of events at last Sunday's ceremony, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced La La Land" as best picture when it was "Moonlight that had in fact won the vote. As a result of the mistake, "Moonlight's" director Barry Jenkins was unable to deliver the speech he had prepared but released it today in the Hollywood Reporter. It reads: "Tarell and I are Chiron. We are that boy. And when you watch "Moonlight," you don't assume a boy who grew up how and where we did would grow up and make a piece of art that wins an Academy Award. I've said that a lot, and what I've had to admit is that I placed those limitations on myself, I denied myself that dream. Not you, not anyone else -- me. And to anyone watching this who sees themselves in us, let this be a symbol, a reflection that leads you to love yourself. Because doing so may be the difference between dreaming at all, and somehow through the Academy's grace, realizing dreams you never allowed yourself to have." (MUSIC) 

Chiron:What are you looking at me like that for? 

Kevin:Come on, man, come on, you just drove down here? 

Chiron:Yeah. (MUSIC) 

Kevin:Who is you, Chiron? (MUSIC) 

Chiron:Spend all my time trying not to remember. (MUSIC) Tried to forget all those times. (MUSIC) 

Man:At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're gonna be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you. (MUSIC) 

Paula:You want to tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time? What's wrong? 

Chiron:I'm good. (MUSIC) 

Paula:No, I've seen good, and you ain't it. 

Kevin:Remember the last time I saw you? (MUSIC) 

Paula:You're my only, I'm your only. No, no, no, you're gonna listen. 

Chiron:To who, ma? Huh, to you? 

Kevin:Who is you, man? I ain't seen you in like a decade. It's not what I expected. 

Chiron:What did you expect? (MUSIC) 

Alison Stewart:"Moonlight" will be re-released in theaters this weekend by A24 for its widest release point to date on more than 1500 screens. Charlie talked to Barry Jenkins along with three of the film's stars, Trevante Rhodes, Naomie Harris, and Andre Holland, back in October, here is a piece of that conversation. 

Charlie Rose:What is it that you hope to accomplish with this film? 

Barry Jenkins:You know, people have said that "Moonlight" is a story that doesn't get told often and characters that we don't see often, they're like voiceless, so my greatest hope for the film and it's what I've experienced at Telluride and Toronto and London, these places far removed from the setting of the film -- 

Charlie Rose:Which is Miami. 

Barry Jenkins:Exactly and inner city Miami, like just these four square blocks that people can see themselves in these characters who they assume are nothing like them. And it's been my experience that people are finding a way to genuinely empathize with the story we're telling and the characters that we're showing in this film. 

Charlie Rose:You know Miami. 

Barry Jenkins:Yeah. Born and raised, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:And how did that shape this story? 

Barry Jenkins:Hugely, you know. There is this almost synesthesia I think that happens when you're working in a place you know. You know, there's a scene in the film where the character says, you know, sometimes that breeze comes through the hood, you know, and Liberty City where I grew up, is like three miles from the ocean, but sometimes you can smell it. I think knowing those kinds of things, you go into a location with more confidence that going to have the same like emotional currency as you felt growing up there. 

Charlie Rose:Trevante, tell us who Chiron is. 

Trevante Rhodes:Chiron is a beautifully flawed individual, who is coming to terms with finding out who he is. Finding what love is. Finding the relationship with his mother and just trying to understand life really in general. 

Charlie Rose:Tell me about his mother. 

Naomie Harris:His mother is Paula, who is a struggling single parent, who's also dealing with quite a severe crack cocaine addiction as well. 

Charlie Rose:What's interesting about this is you see him at different parts in his life. How hard is that to pull off? 

Barry Jenkins:I thought that would be impossible, but, you know, with the way we -- 

Charlie Rose:The mother stays the same. 

Barry Jenkins:Yeah, exactly, you know I wanted to have a, some kind of foundation or bedrock. And you know Naomie as Paula was that bedrock, but, you know, I want it -- I think the time between the chapters is changing the character, as these young men are shaped so much by their environment, that I wanted him to be a different person. The same character, but a different person in each chapter and the hope was if we found actors who have the same feeling in their eyes, because you could see the soul of the character across all three parts, and so far, I think that's what people are experiencing. 

Charlie Rose:Andre, what was the challenge for you. 

Andre Holland:One of the big challenges really is, I play Kevin, who is a childhood friend of Chiron and goes on to become the object of his affection. The big challenge is that I came in at the very end of the film, and seemingly out of nowhere, and we don't really understand why he comes back and they're on screen together for a very long time, working through a problem and we don't quite know what the motivation of the character is. So that was a big challenge identifying what that was, but once we found it, I think -- 

Charlie Rose:We talk about masculinity and we also talk about identity. Are they one in the same? 

Barry Jenkins:I think for this character they are. They are one in the same. I think what happens is, there is this performance of masculinity that the world is projecting at you always. This is how a man walks, this is how he talks, this is how he speaks to another man, this is how he speaks to a woman, and I think when you're getting that sort of that stimulus, so much from the outside world, you start to lose your grip on what your idea of masculinity is, which I think if you're a man growing up in the world we grew up in, it's very key to your identity, you know and it becomes harder to self-identify, you know, the more you're receiving this sort of like both positive and negative reinforcement of what masculinity should look like. 

Charlie Rose:When you were thinking about playing him at the age that you play him and the connection to Andre, did you look at the earlier performances? 

Trevante Rhodes:No. Actually Barry didn't allow it at all. We were both trying to find some semblance of something from the story. 

Charlie Rose:A thread. 

Trevante Rhodes:Something, but Barry, he forbade it, he was really adamant about it as well, but I guess that was to kind of depict how we change so drastically throughout our lives at certain points. So it was an ingenious thing to do, Mr. Barry. (LAUGHTER) 

Barry Jenkins:I just feel like the world is shaping the character so much that when you meet him in each chapter, he's become a different person, and I wanted to keep the soul of the character so if you look in his eyes, you still see the little boy, but he is a different person, you know, and it is great, because he and Andre works this points where that old person slowly comes back to the surface. 

Charlie Rose:You come to the realization that Chiron is gay. How does that affect the relationship that Paula has with him? 

Naomie Harris:I think she really can't accept it at all, she finds it disgusting, unpalatable, and it's part of her further rejection of her son as well. And also, I think she genuinely fears for his safety and what that means growing up in the kind of community that they're growing up in. It's not something that is going to be easily accepted by anyone in that community.
