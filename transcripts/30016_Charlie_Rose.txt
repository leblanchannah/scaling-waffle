Unknown Speaker:Stay with us. 

Charlie Rose:Pianist Marcus Roberts got his start playing in Wynton Marsalis' band. Now leading his own group, he's taken on the biggest challenge for a Jazz musician, playing Strad Piano. This difficult rhythmically style can be heard on his new record "If I Could Be With You." We'll also listen to it here when he plays for us a little bit later on. But I'm pleased to have Marcus Roberts here. Welcome. 

Marcus Roberts:Thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. I'll give you a handshake, I haven't seen you in a while. 

Marcus Roberts:I know. 

Charlie Rose:Last time you were here, Wynton was coming by and you were with him. And so you came by and joined us. 

Marcus Roberts:Right. 

Charlie Rose:And I wanted to have you back. And so it's great to see you, we once did this in Washington too. 

Marcus Roberts:We sure did. 

Charlie Rose:I should say, you didn't get your start with Wynton Marsalis, you got your start back in Florida with your mother. 

Marcus Roberts:That's true. In a good old Baptist church. 

Charlie Rose:What influence did that have? The gospel music and playing in the church? 

Marcus Roberts:Well it had a real big impact on me. That was my first introduction to the piano. And of course gospel music has a tremendous legacy which the hallmark of that tradition is Mahalia Jackson. I remember waking up 5 o'clock in the morning and momma -- she would be playing Mahalia as loud as she could. Waking us up, getting us going. I just sort of expanded from that into jazz music and studying- 

Charlie Rose:When did you start playing the piano? 

Marcus Roberts:Well I was- 

Charlie Rose:You had lessons when you were about 12 didn't you? 

Marcus Roberts:That's right. I started when I was 8 and I was self-taught. Until I was 8 I didn't know what key I was playing in or anything. And I started -- I've only had two piano teachers in my life and they were both master teachers. 

Charlie Rose:You've been blind since you were 4. 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah that's right. 

Charlie Rose:And this jazz -- one of the teachers introduced you to jazz and people began to -- or he would enable you to hear albums by Miles Davis and Art Tatum and all the greats. 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, I remember the first time I heard Tatum I was 13. And I was a real arrogant child, I thought I knew everything. And so I remember one day he said, "I want you to hear something." And he put on a -- first he put on a classical recording of Vladimir Ashkenazy playing the (inaudible) he put that on. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:Then he put on a record of Tatum, and I said, Oh, no." I said, "What two pianists is this? He said, "Oh no, that's one." I said, "what." 

Charlie Rose:It spoke to you, didn't it? 

Marcus Roberts:Oh my god, it was crazy. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. Then you went on to -- did you go to Florida State? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, I sure did. 

Charlie Rose:4 years there? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah that's where I had my second teacher who taught me about the intricacies of the instrument as far as tone production and how to make the instrument ring, which is really the biggest challenge of playing the piano. 

Charlie Rose:Then you got a call from Wynton Marsalis which brings us to Wynton. And his band Carry -- what was it? 

Marcus Roberts:Kenny Kirkland. 

Charlie Rose:Kenny Kirkland. He lost his pianist. 

Marcus Roberts:Right. 

Charlie Rose:You said, "look" -- he had met you before at I guess at Florida State, had he? 

Marcus Roberts:That's right. 

Charlie Rose:So you go out to play with his band and you show up and you already know his entire repertoire. 

Marcus Roberts:Oh yeah, oh yeah. I don't know that was the only way I could see doing it. I didn't want to be there -- I knew that music was going to be hard even if you knew it. So I wanted every advantage that I could get because his music is real hard to play. 

Charlie Rose:And you were there with Wynton for 5 or 6 years right? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:When did you get (inaudible) in the albums in the first -- I remember -- I mean the albums, I've got a list of the albums here which are just -- three of them have been -- Prayer for Peace, The Truth is Spoken, Deep in the Shed, Alone with Three Giants, As Serenity Approaches which is the first time you began to play, to my knowledge, Strad piano, correct? As Serenity Approaches? 

Marcus Roberts:Right. Well no, actually even on the very first one, The Truth is Spoken here the (inaudible) that's strad. I've always been interested in it. It's just that it was an evolving sensibility that it developed -- the first recording where it's all solo piano and a lot of strad is Alone with Three Giants, that record. And then of course, they just expanded from there. Until the last one, I Could Be With You, I think is really the one where I really am expanding fully into, more and more of that history. 

Charlie Rose:We're gonna hear some of that but stay with me in understanding strad piano. Tell me about it and how do you become good at it. 

Marcus Roberts:Well the biggest challenge with playing strad is, frankly, the left hand. Because it is is two handed style. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:It's a very physical style. Very percussive style. And it does require a lot of physical part. Basically the left hand keeps the groove. That's where the dance element is. So you see, it's just leaping all over the place. Just so that the groove is there, then the right hand is free to play rhythms or motifs or whatever it wants to on top of that. But the people when they would dance to strad, they would always pay attention to that left hand because that's where the bottom was. And that's really the main essence of it. 

Charlie Rose:So when you learn to -- when you wanted to become really good at strad piano, you really had to get this left hand up to speed? 

Marcus Roberts:Oh, yeah, it's hard. Cause see what it is, you might be playing something real crazy in the right hand and -- You know, it's like hard to -- 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:To keep that -- you know you have to keep track of all of these different melodies that are going at one time. 

Charlie Rose:In the beginning you learned by just playing the left hand only right? 

Marcus Roberts:Right. 

Charlie Rose:And doing it slowly, and as you get better you can do it faster- 

Marcus Roberts:Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:And develop that sort of rambunctious 

Marcus Roberts:Exactly. 

Charlie Rose:Whatever it becomes. 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah yeah yeah. 

Charlie Rose:James P. Johnson. 

Marcus Roberts:Oh my goodness. 

Charlie Rose:Who was he? 

Marcus Roberts:Oh, man. James P. Johnson was from New Brunswick, New Jersey. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Marcus Roberts:And he's a member of what we call, the Harlem Strad Piano School. And he taught Fats Waller. 

Charlie Rose:Right. 

Marcus Roberts:That was of course his (inaudible). 

Charlie Rose:Great strad piano. 

Marcus Roberts:Oh yeah. And he studied with Lucky Roberts who was one of the Cats around, as far as playing Rag Time. Which strad grew out of Rag Time music and the shout dances. Which James. P. Johnson's parents, they'd have these dances at the house, like all night long. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah. 

Marcus Roberts:On many week nights. They were a family of music lovers and very artistic people. And Johnson was very proficient in playing classical music. 

Charlie Rose:And influenced. His music influenced a lot of people like Duke Ellington. 

Marcus Roberts:Like Duke. That's right, Duke, Fats Waller, Count Basie. Pretty much anybody who played piano after that was influenced by -- 

Charlie Rose:Alright. This is -- I mentioned, If it Could Be You is the newest album. I have the CD in front of me. Marcus is on Tour, is on tour. Has been in New York through the 7th and he's -- where's the next -- You don't know, do you know where you appear next? 

Marcus Roberts:Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 

Charlie Rose:He'll be in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. But he's gonna play for us. Which I'm really trying to get to. This album begins with, In a Southern Sense, and then ends with In a Southern Sense. A long 9 minute piece in the end. In between, In a Southern Sense and Just a Closer Walk With You. Would you play that for me Marcus? Then we'll come back and talk. (piano music) >CHARLIE ROSE: All right. Doesn't get any better than that. Let me just make this point is that some of these are original compositions. Some of the pieces here are original compositions by you, am I right? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, some of the 16s on this record- 

Charlie Rose:Some of them. 

Marcus Roberts:Are originals. It's a retrospective recapitulation of a lot of the things that I had been working on on the piano to now, that's why like this, "Just A Closer Walk With You", that particular song, I used to play in church all the time. 

Charlie Rose:Yeah? 

Marcus Roberts:Then there's a Gershuan and a Colporter. 

Charlie Rose:Moonlight in Vermont. 

Marcus Roberts:Right, and there's- 

Charlie Rose:Now, "Keep Off the Grass", is? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, that's Johnson. 

Charlie Rose:That's Johnson. 

Marcus Roberts:That's very difficult. 

Charlie Rose:Snowy Morning Blues is Johnson, isn't it? 

Marcus Roberts:That's Johnson, that's right. 

Charlie Rose:I'm gonna have you play a little bit for me, because the most famous Johnson song, and it may be the hardest to do is "Carolina Shout", isn't it? 

Marcus Roberts:Yeah, that was a signature piece. That was the piano piece to play. 

Charlie Rose:All right. I'm out of time, except that I want you to play for me for two minutes. I want you to know what a pleasure it is to have you back. Come back anytime. It's great to see you. Great luck on the tour. 

Marcus Roberts:Well, thank you very much. 

Charlie Rose:You are extraordinary. "Carolina Shout", James P. Johnson, this is his signature piece and we're honored to have Marcus Roberts play it and play us out of this show. Thank you for joining us. 

Marcus Roberts:Thank you very much. (piano music) 

Charlie Rose:One more time, that album by Marcus Roberts is "If I Could Be With You". An extraordinary album. It's a pleasure to have you here, my friend. 

Marcus Roberts:My pleasure. 

Charlie Rose:It's great to have you. Marcus is on tour. He was with Vice President Gore at the inauguration. It's always good to have him here. We thank you for joining us. Later this week, Governor Mario Cuomo and the Politics of America, 1993 style. In the meantime, Marcus Roberts will play us off. Marcus? (piano music)
