Frank Capra, John Huston, William Wyler, John Ford, and George Stevens were five of the most successful directors working in Hollywood in the early 20th Century. They each put their careers on hold to enlist in the military and use their filmmaking skills to document World War II for the American public. "Five Came Back: is a new docu-series that will premier on Netflix and in select theaters on March 31st. The series is adapted from Mark Harris' 2014 book of the same name. Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Guillermo del Toro, Lawrence Kasdan, and Paul Greengrass offer commentary on the five iconic directors and the impact their war documentaries had on Hollywood and America at large. Entertainment Weekly" calls "Five Came Back a fascinating thorough history lesson. Here is the trailer. (CROWD CHEERING) 

Stop thinking and follow me," cried Hitler, I will make you masters of the world! (MUSIC) 

A lot of people laughed, he was a clown. If he weren't so evil, it was a comedy. 

America stands at the crossroads of its destiny. (MUSIC) 

In the early years of Hitler's rise, movie going had become an essential part of American culture. But Americans did not realize the extent of the threat Hitler posed. 

He understood cinema could be put in the service of propaganda. 

Americans realized we can't win this war. These guys are going to beat us. 

Western civilization was at stake and we're going to fight until we win. 

Five filmmakers wanted to respond as so many millions of men and women responded... they chose to serve. (MUSIC) 

These documentaries were powerful for American audiences. 

The footage proved that the enormity of the task was worth it. 

We had an enormous story to tell. 

The greatest heroes, the greatest villains on the world's stage... This was real filmmaking. (MUSIC) 

This is the people's war, it is our war. (MUSIC) 

These five men, they were saying goodbye to families who never knew if they would return. (MUSIC) 

And yet, coming out of it, each one made their greatest film. 

I believe a film should have something to say. I think you should make people think and feel... long after they've left the theater. (MUSIC) 

Nothing could prepare anyone for the intensity of the conflict. 

These filmmakers changed the world. (MUSIC) 

I'm pleased to have the author of "Five Came Back," Mark Harris; and Director Laurent Bouzereau, at this table for the first time. Welcome. It's great to have you here. 

Good to be here. 

Thank you so much. 

Where did the idea come to make this into that? 

When I was working on the book, I became really interested in this era and in these World War II movies. And when the book came out, I was surprised at the number of early readers who said to me, it was fascinating to read about these documentaries, too bad most of them are lost. And I would say to them, the documentaries aren't lost. You can see them. They all still exist. They're property of the U.S. government. So I thought, this is a real opportunity for us, you know, as well as I could try to describe these films in a book, there's nothing like being able to show them to people. So that was the germ of the idea to make it a documentary. 

And then the idea was to take five directors and explain each director. 

Yes, that was our director's big innovation. 

Tell me about it. 

Yeah. I mean, we're trying to figure out a very innovative way of telling the story and it was actually Steven Spielberg who said to me, you know, let's try to think of a very interesting way of telling those stories. And you know, who better than directors to talk about directors? So then came the search for five directors to speak for our five guys. And it was great. We had a very short list. Everybody sort of organically was available. It worked out and we have -- 

What were they charged with? 

They were charged with being interviewed in the same way you're interviewing me actually right now, but they had to come in with a lot of knowledge. They had all read the book even before we approached them, you know, and they also did a lot of research. Mark wrote scripts for each of the episodes and I would highlight if Steven Spielberg came in to talk about William Wyler or the things pertaining to Wyler. And so, they were very well prepared. But you know, they were so familiar with the movies, so familiar with their lives. Some of them -- you know, Steven Spielberg knew Wyler. So they came with their own knowledge and their own appreciation. 

Your challenge was to connect them all. 

Yes, absolutely. And you know, it was really well done in the book. It was not only to connect them, but to make sure that on one hand, we had this epic story of World War II. On the other side, we have those five, very specific stories, very personal. So it is sort of back and forth, the balance between the personal and emotional, and the world stage. 

And how it changed their lives. 

And changed their lives. 

This began as a way to honor your father? 

It did. My father was a World War II veteran and it was a way to honor him and also a way to apologize to him posthumously -- he died when I was young -- for the fact that when I was growing up, I didn't really listen to his war stories very much. It was very scary to me as a little kid, the idea that someone would leave his family and go overseas to fight for his life and his country. And of course, as I got older and more interested in war history, I regretted not paying more attention to him. So for my father and for my three uncles, who were all World War II veterans, this is my way of trying to reopen the conversation. 

How did you choose which director for which director? 

Well, it's a great question. You know, we had a lot of thoughts. One thing we didn't want to do is try to think who is the modern version of William Wyler? It was more like trying to find directors who have sensibilities or traits that were comparable to those five original directors from the past. And so, Steven Spielberg who I've known for many years, I was always impressed with his humanity, how kind he was, and also, you know, his fascination with his own roots, being Jewish. And we felt William Wyler was very similar in spirit. And Steven Spielberg talks about meeting Wyler, and being you know, a young director meeting a legendary director, and saying, I was so impressed with Wyler and how kind he was, and that was my experience, frankly, and so I thought perfect casting. Francis Coppola, I remember being a teenager and living in France, and "Apocalypse Now" came out, which was a huge event in France. And Coppola had done a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival and had said making the film was like a war, and he was so passionate about it, and there was combat, filmmaking, and there were famous pictures of him holding a gun to his head on the set of the film. And I'm like, you know, this echoes John Huston in many ways, and this sort of fiery personality. Paul Greengrass comes from the documentary world, and he identified with John Ford in a way that was very personal and could relate to his own journey. Guillermo del Toro was perhaps the most unusual choice. You know, he is known for fantasy and horror films, but he is an immigrant just like Frank Capra. And his films, Guillermo's movies are extremely emotional. And so, he really connected with Capra. And lastly, Lawrence Kasdan is very famous for the movies he directed like "Body Heat" and "The Big Chill," "Silverado." But before that, he was extremely famous for being a screenwriter and coming up with some of the most iconic movie lines, whether it had been "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or "Empire Strikes Back." And so, it was important that we had a director who was also very famous for his screenplays. And therefore, we enrolled him to speak about George Stevens. He had a great affinity with Stevens. And that's how we got our five guys. 

And when Frank Capra saw "Triumph of the Will," how did that affect him? 

He came to New York where there was a print of it at the Museum of Modern Art, when he was trying to figure out how to make the series of movies became "Why We Fight." And Capra was in a tough place because the government wanted to make -- wanted to have him make these new training films for soldiers, but they didn't give him writers, they didn't give him a staff, they barely gave him a budget. So he comes to New York, he sees "Triumph of the Will," and his first reaction is, we're going to lose. This is so powerful, we're going to lose the war. Forget the movies, we're going to lose the war. And then, he thought, I can use this movie and kind of kill two birds with one stone. First of all, we can turn their own propaganda against them by showing our incoming soldiers how the enemy thinks. And second of all, we have all this seized propaganda footage from Germany, from Japan, from Italy. I don't have the money to shoot these movies, but I can certainly compile a movie from existing footage and get the message across that way. 

The movies were, in part, propaganda? 

Yes, they were, they were. I mean, that was part of the task that the government gave these five filmmakers to sell the war, not only to the American public, but to soldiers who were 18 and 19 years old, who were coming in and really didn't know the reason we were in the war in the first place. 

To give them a reason as to why we're fighting. 

Yes, not just to give them a reason, but to excite them, to enflame their patriotism. And Capra was very, very good at doing that. 

Did any of them have some resistance to that at all? 

You know, I think they all wanted to serve their country. Capra had the most directly propagandistic assignment. For the other four, they thought what they were going to do was travel the world to wherever the battlefronts were and document the war, you know, just to bring the truth of the war home to the public. So I think sometimes there are impulses as filmmakers to tell a great story and their impulses as patriots to, you know, sell the war and to, you know, make the case for our side. And their impulse as artists, they clashed with each other and you know, sometimes one thing won and sometimes another thing does. 

I don't -- this is not related to your film -- but there was a story about, some of the film that was taken in World War II, and the government prevented it from being shown, I think it was from German concentration camps. 

Yes. 

And I think it involved Alfred Hitchcock who had been brought over to edit it. 

Well, the British army film unit, which was kind of the counterpart of the American effort, did deploy Hitchcock as a propaganda filmmaker. And all of these feature filmmakers who lent their efforts to the war, at some point had some of what they did suppressed or censored because the content was too violent. I mean, most Americans did not see the vast majority of D-day footage, because it was much too bloody. John Huston had a movie suppressed for 35 years because -- it was a movie called "Let There Be Light" about the psychological toll of the war on veterans. And it was too emotional and too upsetting, it didn't tell the story the army wanted to tell. 

Didn't camera people have to be there in order to document D-day? 

They did. 

And what risk did they put themselves to? 

Oh, tremendous risk. I mean, John Ford and George Stevens were at D-day in person. Ford overseeing the Navy effort, and Stevens overseeing the army efforts. But we're talking about literally hundreds of cameras and dozens of cameramen and still photographers who were, you know, as much in harm's way as any soldier in D-day, maybe more, because they were carrying cameras not guns. 

What happened to them, what was the impact on the public of these films? 

I think the impact was tremendous because, you know, you have to put yourself back in the time where you had to go to the movie to see those newsreel footage. It is not something you can get on your iPhone or watch on TV. So I think those were -- when you think about "Midway," which was the movie John Ford did, you know, that was the first time that war was shown in color. You know, the footage that George Stevens got of the camps, you know, this was before there's a vocabulary for the holocaust. So those were tremendous discoveries for viewers, and extremely shocking, and extremely impactful, albeit, in a propagandic kind of way, if that's a word. 

What impact did it have on the lives and future lives of these directors? 

Well, I mean, you know, when they came back, they all -- I think there was a spirit of independence first of all, that they wanted to create their own company, and be working for themselves as directors. Capra, Wyler, and Stevens created their own company. And I think Wyler's first movie, "The Best Years of Our Lives" after the war speaks for itself, I'm sure you're familiar with it. But it's interesting to look at the film and compare it to "It's a Wonderful Life," which is the movie that Capra does, and that failed at the box office, where "The Best Years of Our Lives" is a huge success. You know, John Ford goes on and makes some of the most iconic westerns. George Stevens, you know, doesn't work for a very long time. 

Stevens was the first cameraman into Dachau. He made the films that were eventually shown as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. And he was so shaken by that that he, who had been a really successful director of comedy before the war, said he could never make another comedy after what he had seen in Germany. So in the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s, he becomes a very distinguished director of drama. 

Did the film at Nuremberg make a difference? 

It really did make a difference. You know, the trial had been -- it was being widely covered by the press and everybody said the first two days were sort of flat and boring and that the prosecutors were not really making an impressive case. Then the film was shown and a spotlight was turned on the defendants' box. The defendants were all forced to view the movies. And the witnesses to the trial say the effect was electrifying. The defendants' own attorneys said after seeing the movie, they found it impossible to sit in the same room with the people they were representing. 

And that speaks a lot for George Stevens' journey, you know, who goes from being a filmmaker of comedies and musicals into doing documentary filmmaking. And once he goes into the camps, he becomes an evidence gatherer. So that speaks for his transformation as a filmmaker, as a man, and is reflected after the war when he comes back and can't work. 

But John Huston's film, after the war, which was a documentary called "Let There Be Light" was banned. 

Yes, about PTSD. Yeah, and it's, I would say that of all the movies I had to watch repeatedly, aside from the Holocaust footage, is the one that brings tears to my eyes. I mean, it's just so vivid to see those men, and this is before -- actually, the word maybe existed or didn't exist at the time, PTSD. But it's a notion that is really discovered in that film. And yet, it was banned and he fought to get it eventually released. 

PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. 

Correct. 

Did these guys, when they come back, change Hollywood? 

I think they did in a way. I mean, Capra's big dream that all directors would become independent of studios failed. Ironically, the first movie his company made, "It's A Wonderful Life," was such a box office flop, that it sank the whole company. And the directors went back to working for studios. But there was a spirit of independence within them and a desire to make more socially realistic, tougher, more honest movies than what they had been making before the war. And you see that grow throughout the '40s and '50s, straight into the 1960s. 

How did the all-powerful studio heads react to all this? 

Well, you know, the thing about all-powerful studio heads is they do like to conserve their power, so it was a constant growing fight over everything from whether studios or directors would pick projects for directors, to content, how much would the production code allow these directors to put in movies? That was a 20-year fight after the war, until the production code fell apart. 

Liberty Films was Capra's company? 

It was Capra's in partnership with Stevens and Wyler. He asked them to go in with him. And they each planned to make three movies. So it would have been a total of nine. 

Each year? 

No, just in the first wave of their project. That would have been nine movies independent of the studios. And the first one was going to be "It's A Wonderful Life." And amazingly, now, because we all consider it a classic, it was a very expensive movie. It did not make its money back, and there was no money left for the company, they had to give up after one movie. 

When you look at these five that made these films, is there one you admire more than the others? 

Well, I have a real fondness for William Wyler because my dad took me to see "Ben Hur, as a re-release when I was a kid in France, on the big screen, it was just my dad and I. And discovering that movie, was like discovering a whole new vocabulary of images and it touched me tremendously and got me really interested in cinema. So Wyler, but all of them, you know, made gigantic contributions, and I have studied all of them, and through this documentary, I think I have an even bigger appreciation for them.
