Charlie Rose:PETER EDELMAN has devoted his life to the plight of the poverty-stricken. He began working as an advocate and policy maker alongside Robert Kennedy. After Senator Kennedy's death, he continued his work as a personal memorial to his mentor and friend. He went on to serve under President Clinton as the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the Human Health Services. In 1996, the president signed the new welfare bill into law. PETER EDELMAN resigned in protest, believing the bill ended a 60-year commitment to poor children. In this book, Searching for America's Heart, Edelman proposes an optimistic new idea for reform combining national and local activism. I'm pleased to have him on this program. Welcome. Good to have you here. 

Peter Edelman:I'm so glad to be here. 

Charlie Rose:There's a lot to talk about, but let me just take this relationship with Robert Kennedy. What was it about him and his commitment that so infused you to continue in that mission rather than going off to do something different? 

Peter Edelman:Well, it was so real. It was so every day, all day. He cared so much about people who had less, and especially children in our country. And I had the chance to kind of go to school along with him. He was way ahead of me, but we went around the country. We went to Mississippi. We went to Indian reservations. We went to Appalachia. And I learned firsthand about poverty and got that commitment that he had to really make a difference. He just needed to do something every day to make a difference. That was his creed. 

Charlie Rose:Because of his own life experiences until he was an adult, until he was attorney general, he never really grasped the impact of poverty in America, as he didn't really grasp the impact of racism of America. It was a profound adult experience for him. 

Peter Edelman:Yes, yes. There was something there all the time. And Evan Thomas's book talks about his childhood and it's a little bit of psychological theory, but-- 

Charlie Rose:Being the youngest, what impact it had. Not the youngest, but the smallest. 

Peter Edelman:And being away at school in the '30s and his father was in England and feeling neglected, whether that's true or not. But it's certainly true that when he became attorney general, the very first thing that he did was to install his high school friend David Hackett in a little office right next to his big office and say, ``You work on juvenile delinquency.'' And they recruited people from all over the government and people from outside. And, of course, that turned into working on poverty. And he went himself, the way he always learned, while Bay of Pigs was going on, all the of the early testing from Krushchev and everything. In 1961, Robert Kennedy goes to Harlem and he meets with groups of young people separately, black and Italian -- young men -- to hear from them what they're concerned about, why they think they're not making it and getting opportunities in the society. That was the way he always learned. 

Charlie Rose:If he had lived and if he had become president, what do you think he might have done? 

Peter Edelman:He was deeply committed to healing the racial divisions in our society. And he understood as no one else did who was an elected official, the connections between race and poverty. And he had a very deep commitment to empowering people in their communities to tackle the problems in neighborhoods and to get jobs for people and to have federal policy that would really have the federal money go straight on down to the neighborhoods and get to people there. And, of course, that was what his idea was in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which was one of the early community development corporations in the country. So he would have-- of course he would have worked on-- I think he would have ended the war in Vietnam much, much sooner, saved probably millions of lives. But in our country, he would have worked on healing most divisions. 

Charlie Rose:Many will argue even today that the principle victim of the war in Vietnam was a great society. 

Peter Edelman:Absolutely true. Lyndon Johnson was committed to doing something about poverty. And I-- just as he was probably more committed than any president in our history to civil rights, what he did in terms of the civil rights act of '64 and the voting rights act. But it just ran out of gas. There was the money there. 

Charlie Rose:And then here comes Bill Clinton. Let me make one point here. In-- when you went down to Mississippi with Senator Kennedy -- or was it Attorney General Kennedy? I guess, senator? 

Peter Edelman:Senator. Senator, yeah. 

Charlie Rose:When you went down there, you met Marian Wright. 

Peter Edelman:That's true. 

Charlie Rose:An African-American woman who had gone to Yale Law School and knew-- did you know her before that? 

Peter Edelman:No. No, no. 

Charlie Rose:You met her in Mississippi? 

Peter Edelman:No, I mean, I met her because of Robert Kennedy, because of the wonderful good fortune of going down there -- if I can say this -- going down there and seeing starving children. And of course he was deeply committed to coming back and doing something about that. And that work led to the food stamp program and to really doing something about hunger in America. But what I got out of it-- 

Charlie Rose:Was a wife. 

Peter Edelman:Yep. 

Charlie Rose:And now three great kids, right? 

Peter Edelman:Yeah, that's right. Thank you. 

Charlie Rose:And she has been the great head of the Children's Defense Fund. And Hillary Clinton sat on the board of that and they were chairs as well. 

Peter Edelman:Yeah. 

Charlie Rose:President William Jefferson Clinton, 1992, comes to office. You go to HHS. 

Peter Edelman:I did. 

Charlie Rose:What happened and what is it that you feel was a -- I don't want to use the word ``betrayal, '' but was a, in a sense, what? Characterize it for me. 

Peter Edelman:Well, it wasn't a portrayal in a personal sense. I think-- 

Charlie Rose:I'm not talking about you personally. I really mean in terms of poor children. 

Peter Edelman:I think it turns out that, and we've seen this in other things that have happened, sad to say, that he's very interested in his own survival. He's interested in himself. And it came to be 1996 and he was running for re-election and the Republicans decided after they had been unwilling to give him a welfare bill that he would sign, they gave him a couple that were so far to the right that he couldn't do it, wouldn't do it. And so they put in front of him a welfare bill that essentially destroyed the idea that anybody had a right to get help. 

Charlie Rose:After two years you were-- had to go to work. But the big thing is you could only five years of assistance for the whole life of bringing up your children, the whole time of no matter how many children you had, two or three. So over an 18, 20 year period, only five years of assistance. And even more important, or equally important, that the states could have whatever policy they wanted; didn't have to help anybody. And we've seen the results of that. And he was advised, Charlie, by Leon Panetta, George Stephanopolous, Harold Ickes -- close political advisers, not Dick Morris, who advised him the other way. Right I understand that. 

Peter Edelman:Who advised him to sign the bill. 

Charlie Rose:Dick Morris said, ``You won't get re-elected if you don't sign this.'' 

Peter Edelman:His political advisers -- these three that I ``You should veto it.'' And he went ahead and decided-- they said he could survive politically. He said, in effect, ``I don't even want this. I don't even want to take the chance that this will become an issue, so I'm going to sign it.'' And I think that was just really a very bad thing to do. 

Charlie Rose:And so, seven days later you resigned. 

Peter Edelman:I resigned, yes, a couple of weeks later. And I think I did the right thing. 

Charlie Rose:Resignations on principle are rare in American public life. 

Peter Edelman:It's-- it's not something that's in our tradition. 

Charlie Rose:Cy Vance did it, I think. 

Peter Edelman:Cy Vance, although he didn't say so at the time, but he did. And there were three admirable diplomats over the Bosnia issue, you remember, early in the Clinton administration. There certainly have been examples. In the case of Watergate, you remember. 

Charlie Rose:But here's one which there were all kinds of relationships. I mean, Hillary Clinton. 

Peter Edelman:Yes. 

Charlie Rose:Marian Wright-Edelman. 

Peter Edelman:Yes. 

Charlie Rose:You. I mean, there was a connection. There was a sense that you had great hope for this president. 

Peter Edelman:Well, I had great hope for this president. And by that time, I'd been quite disappointed. And in any case, this thing was such a break with 60 years of policy. Now, the welfare system that we had needed to be fixed. It wasn't good. It wasn't helping people get out of poverty. 

Charlie Rose:Pat Moynihan says the mistake of Bill Clinton was to take on health care before he took on welfare reform; that welfare reform would have been a better first effort. 

Peter Edelman:I don't agree with that. I think health care reform was for all American people, you know. We had 40-- at that time, 37 million, now it's 42 million people without health care. And I think that was-- meant more to more people and was more of a mandate for him when he was elected. So I don't agree with Senator Moynihan about that. But what I do think is that what he went ahead and did here was just such a break with where we had-- so devastating to too many children in this country. And I just couldn't abide that. 

Charlie Rose:Just as a moment of history, were you allowed the opportunity to make this case in person with all the passion that you could bring to the subject and with all the calling into the memory of Robert Kennedy, et cetera? 

Peter Edelman:I was a part of a group at HHS working with Donna Shalala. So for me and Wendell Primus and Mary Jo Bane, who resigned along with me, she was our spokesperson. 

Charlie Rose:So you made the argument to the secretary and she made the argument to the president? 

Peter Edelman:Oh, she certainly did. She tried very hard. There was a climactic meeting at the end of July 1996 where she and Bob Rubin and Henry Cisneros and Bob Reich and the three political advisers that I mentioned and the vice president and others were in the group. 

Charlie Rose:All made what argument? Did they just-- were there? Did Bob Rubin oppose it? 

Peter Edelman:Yes, Bob Rubin opposed it. 

Charlie Rose:Did the vice president oppose it? 

Peter Edelman:No, the vice president urged him to sign the bill. But you had four cabinet members -- Mickey Kantor was there, urged him to to sign the bill. But the majority of people in the room-- 

Charlie Rose:Former chairman of the campaign. 

Peter Edelman:Yes. The majority of people in the room, senior advisers, urged him to veto the legislation. And his answer, which I can only attribute to-- I mean, you know, politicians make political calculations, I understand that. I don't think this was a close call in his mind; that he was gravely threatened and therefore he had to do this. The cloud hadn't come up over the horizon yet. 

Charlie Rose:Wait a minute. I mean, I think he would disagree with that, Peter. I mean, I think he would clearly say to you, I don't think I could have gotten re-elected. Because Dick Morris, who he was believing at that time, was saying that very thing -- you cannot be re-elected if you don't sign this bill. 

Peter Edelman:Charlie, that's why it's so important to know, and I've talked to Harold Ickes about this, to know that Harold Ickes and George Stephanopolous and Leon Panetta said you can be re-elected. That's so important. Yes, Bob Rubin maybe doesn't know about whether somebody can or can't be re-elected, but these are his political advisers, some of his political advisers who said you will benefit because you will have stood up on principle and you 

Charlie Rose:Yeah, but Dick Morris had rescued him when he was down before and so he had more confidence in Dick Morris at this time. 

Peter Edelman:Maybe so. 

Charlie Rose:Probably. 

Peter Edelman:Maybe so. But it was a terrible thing to do. 

Charlie Rose:Let me take you to today. It's unacceptable in America that we have, what, 30 percent of people, what -- living-- what's the poverty consequence in America? 

Peter Edelman:Well, we have 30-plus million people that would be classified as poor, although I think if you measure it by what it really costs anybody to live-- you know, the poverty line is about $14,000 for a family of three. Who can get by on $14,000 in any major city in this country? I mean, maybe in some small town. And so 30 million probably-- 30 percent probably is the right number in terms of what it really costs to live and the struggles that people are having to make it. And it's why I'm so troubled about this tax cut that we're hearing about that, you know, you have 27 percent of people who are working who aren't paying any taxes-- any income taxes now. They are paying payroll taxes. They're getting no benefit out of this tax cut as it's proposed. This is wrong. 

Charlie Rose:You know what's interesting? I just saw the Wall Street Journal, I think, Bill Gates's father, I think Warren Buffett and a series of very wealthy people are saying don't eliminate the estate tax to provide a benefit to our heirs because if you do, you will be eliminating a huge amount of revenue coming in to the federal government which ought to be there so that other people don't have to bear the burden of that kind of taxation. 

Peter Edelman:It's a revenue loss and I think it's going to play havoc with something that's very important, that President Bush ought to think is very important -- which is charitable giving to support the kinds of organizations, whether it's symphonies or museums or libraries or the faith-based organizations that President Bush says are so important to help individuals. This idea of ending the estate tax is really inconsistent with other parts of what Bush says he wants to do. 

Charlie Rose:So what should we do? What should we do about poverty in America? And what should we do about the worldwide consequences of too many people in a world in which there is enormous prosperity are living on $2 a day. 

Peter Edelman:Yes. Well, we need to do vastly more, along with all of the wealthy countries in the world who are doing a better job in terms of the percent of their gross national product they spend on helping less advantaged nations, vastly more there to try to bring development, to try to bring better health and everything. And in our country, I think, number one, we need to recognize that we-- our pretension, our ideal, is that we are one country, that everybody who's here is a part of this country. We've turned into two countries. And so wherever you want to break it, whether it's poverty or it's near-poverty, which is where I think the line is, we need to be saying, If you are working, you should get an income, and everything that goes with that in terms of health care and child care, that's enough for you to survive on. And we should be magnanimous enough and have enough heart to say that if you're not in a position to work, we're going to provide protection for your children, because the way they-- the only way they can grow up and make it is if they have a chance through their childhood. And to get good education, we need to fix the public schools in this country. The fundamental point that I make in this book is that it is not just about national policy. And I have a whole long list of things that we ought to do in 

Charlie Rose:So, in other words, it's not just about how you come down in terms of the role of government and-- in these issues. 

Peter Edelman:It is certainly not only about the role of 

Charlie Rose:So it's not just about-- --ideology or, in fact-- 

Peter Edelman:It's about us. It's about our responsibility, it's about-- It's also, of course, that people need to take responsibility for themselves. 

Charlie Rose:Yes. 

Peter Edelman:--Robert Kennedy stood for that was very important. 

Charlie Rose:Accountability. 

Peter Edelman:Accountability, that we do all have to be responsible and accountable. That's a part of what the kind of welfare reform that we should have had. But that we have a community responsibility to help, that that's part of the answer. We're not going to get the public schools that we want in this country unless in every community, we really all participate in improving those schools for our children, or a system of child care or jobs in the regional economy-- all of these things require people to make an effort at the community level, as well as volunteer on an individual basis. And there are millions of people who are already volunteering, but we need more of that. 

Charlie Rose:A lot of your conservative critics would say, PETER EDELMAN is blind to the cycle of dependence, and especially in terms of welfare, and that if it became, notwithstanding there were some people whose life would have been much worse except for it. On the other hand, there were lots of people, in a sense, who were dependent on it and who had become, you know, living testimony to the failure. 

Peter Edelman:Yes. We had-- it was a failed policy. We had too many people on welfare. We had too many people on welfare because we were not seriously helping people to get jobs, we were not seriously doing what was necessary to help their children at the same time, to make sure that the children would be protected. It was, it was a lousy policy. Dependence is not a good idea. But the answer is not to say to people, bumper sticker, We're going to just kick you off. 

Charlie Rose:Yes. 

Peter Edelman:And the thing that troubles me so much about this, we have a lot of people who've gotten jobs as a result 

Charlie Rose:Shock therapy, so to speak. 

Peter Edelman:Shock therapy, that's right. We have a lot of people who have gotten jobs, but they're not getting out of poverty. More importantly, we have at least 3 million people right now, as a result of this policy, all around the country who neither have a job nor have cash assistance. And that includes over 2 million children. And they're worse off. The census numbers show that they're worse off. And I just think that's wrong. We could have done it right, and we didn't. 

Charlie Rose:And you know what's amazing to me? Regardless of where you come down on some of these ideological debates and to me, is that the consequences for a child's life, if poverty means malnutrition, if poverty means the inability to be available to get on the train that America promise offers-- 

Peter Edelman:Yes. 

Charlie Rose:--because of poverty, because of the absence of opportunity, because of the fact that poverty and malnutrition and a lot of other things like that, impede your ability to be educated. 

Peter Edelman:Yes. 

Charlie Rose:And a lot of other things. This book is called Searching for America's Heart: RFK and the Renewal of Hope, with this rather extraordinary picture of Peter and-- is that in Mississippi, or where is that? 

Peter Edelman:That's actually-- 

Charlie Rose:Is that in 

Peter Edelman:-- in California, with-- when we went to see Cesar Chavez. We're each wearing a Huelga-- a strike great strike button. 

Charlie Rose:OK. Great to have you, thank you. 

Peter Edelman:Thank you so much.
