Jean-Dominque Barby was the editor-in-chief of French Elle magazine when he was paralyzed by a massive stroke at only 42 years old. He was able to communicate only by moving his left eyelid. Remarkably, he managed to dictate his short memoir one letter at a time. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is the memoir. It tells the story of his life. French filmmaker Jean-Jacques Beineix's new film documents his extraordinary story. It was seen on Cinemax on November 6th. It will be seen again on November 29th. The filmmaker joins us now for a conversation about an extraordinary story and we will see a couple of excerpts from the film, which I urge you to see. I first became aware of this when I was reading The New York Times and there was an amazing story about this man, who had an amazing will to live and to tell his story only by blinking his left eye. And then I went to Paris and I met the filmmaker and it-- it is a remarkable story of the human spirit. Everybody who knows about this story has been touched by it and we want to show you a little bit of this film, which I know you'll want to see, and also to talk about those people who helped make the film and the book possible. Welcome to this broadcast. Tell me how it began for you. You'd made a number of films in France that were seen around the world and then comes this opportunity. 

Yeah, that was the editor, who asked me whether I would consider or not-- yes or not to do a movie about a man who was paralyzed and who had just dictated a book by blinking an eye and I thought it was a joke. Then I read the book and I was captured by the emotion and by the quality of the writing and the quality of the way this man was projecting us, the readers, into his own world. He was trapped in his body, incapable to move, but he was extremely free and he had the talent to give you through words the ability to be a butterfly. So as a movie maker, I was captured not only by his literature, but by the images he was suggesting to me. 

What's remarkable about this is that he was a man in full flight in life-- 

Yes. 

--a bon vivant-- 

Yes. 

--a very good editor, someone who loved life and wine and song and literature and loved the life that he was living. 

Yes. He was the chief editor of Elle magazine, surrounded by pretty girls. He was extremely efficient. He was some kind of a Don Juan. 

And then all of a sudden, he can't communicate. 

And then-- 

He's dead, he's-- 

He's dead. And his friends thought he couldn't talk and only after a few days, they noticed that there was a possibility, so they start to ask him, ''Could you hear us? If you hear us, let's blink.'' And that's the way the whole system started. 

Okay. You will meet later on tape, an interview I did in Paris in June, Claude Mendibil. She is responsible for communicating with him, resulting in putting the book together letter by letter. Here is an excerpt from the film seen on Cinemax. 

(repeats the alphabet, writing down a letter when Barby blinks.) Alors-- (reading) (through subtitles) '' 'You can handle the wheelchair,' said the therapist, smiling as if this was good news. To my ears, it had the ring of a life sentence. (Barby blinks) 

How did they learn to do this? 

I think they put the letters in the order of the most usual letter you use in the alphabet and-- but what was remarkable, it's not just the system, but the way Claude and Jean-Dominique was capable to communicate because within the system, there was a great deal of personal feelings and she was guessing. You know, when people, they have this system of ''Tick, tick, tick, tick'' in the Army, not only one people have the same way to do it. 

Right. 

So I notice when I met some other ''locked-in syndrome'' people that Jean-Dominique has had a very, very smart and keen way to answer because his blinking was not just a blinking, it was a blinking of satisfaction, a blinking of suffers, a blinking of anger, a 100 ways of blinkings. 

What does he say in this book -- the book -- about what happened to him and how he comes to terms with it? 

Many things. His past life was over. He was a new-born baby-- two lives, one before the accident, one after the accident. He also-- he was never regretting anything, but saying that ''Behave, be careful. Don't let chances pass when you are on your two legs.'' But no complaints, ever. And-- 

Not bitter? 

Not bitterness. Not bitterness. Not-- never complaining. 

Anger? 

Probably, but-- 

Yeah. How could you not be? 

How could you not be? I ask him one day, ''Do we have to spare you? Do I have to be nice with you? Can I deal with you like anybody?'' He said, ''Like anybody. But asking people to consider-- to consider me like anybody else would be extremely pervert.'' He knew exactly what he was. He was in a state of anger with the Parisian (? ) world, le Parisien slub, (sp? ) you know-- 

Yes. Yes. 

--because they had treated him of a vegetable. 

And he was angry at that, that they thought he was a vegetable and part of the reason he does this is to say-- 

Yeah. 

--''I'm not a vegetable.'' 

Yeah. 

''I have a brain and I''-- 

Yeah. Yeah. But that was-- not only that. I think there was something extremely nice in this way to behave, which was also, ''I want my children have an idea of I am still their father. I love them.'' And it's a message of love. 

Roll tape. This is Barby talking and looking at how he looked-- not talking, but reflected on how he looks in the mirror. 

(through interpreter) (reading) ''Reflected in the glass, I saw the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde. His mouth was twisted, his nose damaged, his hair tousled, his gaze full of fear. For a moment, I stared at the dilated pupil without realizing it was only mine.'' The end of the chapter? (Barby blinks) (she recites letters) You? (Barby blinks) (letters) You doing? (Barby blinks) (letters) You are doing? (Barby blinks) (letters) What are you doing tonight? (Barby blinks) Tonight I'll-- I don't know. I'll probably go for a walk on the beach, along the esplanade. Then I'll have dinner and read. What about you? What are you going to watch? Do you know what you want to watch? I'll show you what's on. 

Elie Wiesel about this book, about this story, said, ''This heartbreaking story about a uniquely gifted writer is about transforming pain into creativity, human despair into a literary miracle.'' How do you characterize what this story is about? 

The story of a man who's discovering that-- with losing his capacity to stand on his two feet, he gain also the capacity to fly. 

The butterfly. 

Yes, which is an extraordinary lesson for a lot of people who suffers, but also for a lot of people like us, who sometime don't know what to do with the people who are different. So this is the way-- it is also a message of understanding. ''Take care. Look at people. They may look silent, but they have something to say. There is something within themselves. There is a heart beating. There is a brain.'' So we're afraid of handicaps in this society. We are made to be efficient, to be creative, to be-- to give to the society, to create goods and-- but we are also having a heart and we need love. 

Claude Mendibil-- she-- she's a remarkable woman. 

When I saw her for the first time, you know, I was going to do a documentary and the minute I saw her, I discovered that, in fact, I had a star in this movie, which was-- I was not ready for that, but I used to the fiction (? ) to the cinema, so I decided I have to use her. She is extremely powerful. Jean-Luc Godard used to say making cinema is to take a nice, beautiful woman and a camera. But in that case, I had a wonderful woman and a wonderful man. 

And an amazing story. 

So I needed just the camera. 

This is just her talking. She speaks French with translation, when I was in Paris in June. Here it is. 

(through interpreter) Changed my life? I wouldn't really say that, maybe not deeply, but it's true that I remain totally amazed by this meeting of ours. I think I'm going to go on living with him because our relationship was so strong. The experience was so powerful. I certainly didn't expect I would meet that much vital force in somebody so severely handicapped. I certainly didn't expect life to find that force of expression. 

There is also this to be said about the film, which is about what, 28 minutes? 

Twenty-seven. 

Twenty-seven minutes. He did not want this film to be edited for broadcast anywhere, so you couldn't edit the film. You had to take the complete film. 

Yes. 

He saw the film in part? 

No, he saw the whole film. 

He saw the whole film. 

Saw the whole film. 

He died-- 

Right. 

--two days-- one day-- what was it, 24 hours? 

Two days-- 

Forty-eight hours. 

Two days, yeah, after the book was published. 

The book became number 1 in Paris, number 1 in London. But he was not at his death of heart failure overcome by his tragedy. His spirit was strong-- 

Yes. 

--and he wanted to write another book. 

Yes. Yes. We even spoke about working on a script. He was full of life and-- but this-- his physical condition was making his-- his body weak and he couldn't resist. But he was ready for new adventures and I'm really sad because I think he would have given us a lot of-- of things from his inner world because I considered him like a pioneer because he was living-- 

Pioneer? 

Pioneer-- sorry. He was living at the limits of the human condition. Very few people can testify and write and talk about such things, so it was-- he was at the beginning of a long journey and I feel very sorry for him and for us that we couldn't have-- 

Go any further on the journey. 

Yes, with him. 

Yeah. (reading) ''He described the alphabet letters as like his friends, each pushing to be included in the jotted notes that are his only way of communication. 'If you cannot smile,' he says, 'at least you can spell the word and then your visitors will know you're still alive within your cocoon.' '' Jean-Dominique Barby, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.
