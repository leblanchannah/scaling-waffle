It is Friday. It is October 4th. Welcome to the broadcast. Dan Rather has probably covered more interesting stories than any broadcast reporter during the last 10 to 15 years. He has been everywhere. He has been on a number of broadcasts from 60 Minutes to the CBC Evening News. He's done 48 Hours. He's been at the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union and China at Tiananmen Square. I suspect that of all of the things that have been said about somebody who has been so visible, the one thing he would appreciate the most is being a good reporter. Whether you have liked his work or not liked his work or have had some criticism or praise, and he's had all of that. He's taken some body blows. No one doubts that he is one of the best broadcast reporters that has come along in a long time. He has now written the first part, I suspect, of an autobiography called, I Remember. It goes back to the very beginning, to Houston. It is a pleasure to have you here. 

Thank you, Charlie. It's a pleasure to be here. 

I want to talk a little bit about the beginning in a sense because this book seems to be you paying homage to the roots that have shaped you. Why did you write it? What did you want to say? What's the message here? 

There are a lot of reasons I wrote it. First and foremost, I like books. I like to be associated with books. I like the feel of a book. There's a unique satisfaction that comes from writing a book. At core, at base, that's why I wrote it. Now among the other reasons is that I've never had a short, simple answer to those people who said, "Who are you? Where are you from? How did you get where you are?" For anybody who's interested, and I would perfectly understand if a lot of people were not interested in the slightest, then part of the answer is in this book. Other reasons included what you alluded to, that the longer I go, the more connections I make between the early years and what I do in my professional life, what I do in my personal life. I'll give you an example. I had rheumatic fever from the time I was about 10 until I was about 14 and a half at a time when rheumatic fever, most of the time, it went undiagnosed and nobody knew how to treat it. I got an early sense of how vulnerable I was, how vulnerable we all are for that matter, how fragile it is. I began to think, "You know that was very important" because I had good parenting. I had great teachers, and how underestimated great teachers are. People would say, "All right. This is a tough time, but Danny, you got to be determined. You got to get up." While it seemed a very big thing at the time, I know it was one of the defining moments of my life. I wanted to write about that before the memory faded. 

Tell me about the professor, the teacher, the coach at I guess was it at Houston? Was it in high school or college the coach who said, "You're too little and you're too yellow." 

That was at college. That was in Sam Houston after I'd played, after a fashion, high school football. He basically said, "You're too little and besides that, you're yeller" as he would say in his part of the country. Again, it was a defining experience because I came away from it determined to prove him wrong. 

You talk about the rheumatic fever. It certainly thwarted any chance of being an athlete that you might have dreamed about in terms of where you would find a life direction, but it turned you to journalism? 

It did in this sense. I had wanted, before I had rheumatic fever, I had sold newspapers on a street corner. By the way, having to fight for your street corner to sell papers is not so far from fighting for the big story, fighting for the exclusive, fighting the ratings, fighting to survive in big time, prime time television. For reasons that I've never been able to explain, because I don't really know, I had always dreamed of being a reporter before I had rheumatic fever. Part of that may be because my father was a voracious reader of newspapers. My father only finished I think the 9th grade. He worked with his back and his hands. He loved newspapers. That probably was the beginning of my wanting to be a reporter. When I had rheumatic fever, I was in bed with rheumatic fever, bedridden. December 7th, 1941. I was riveted to the radio through most of the war. I heard the great ones, Murrow, Sevareid, Collingwood, Bill (Shirer), Elmer Davis. I heard the great ones and I began to hope and dream. If I hadn't had rheumatic fever, that probably wouldn't have happened. 

What was the first break for you? 

My first break in journalism was to get to college. I hung around newspapers. I was a gopher at the Houston Press. I hung around the Houston Chronicle. I tried to get on with the Houston Post. At that time, there were a lot of newspaper men who hadn't been to college. I was told in effect, "Kid, in your time, you won't have a chance to be a reporter unless you go to college." I had no idea how I was going to get to college. I wound up going to college. That was a break. 

The first in your family? 

Yes, I was. Thanks to a very good teacher, Hugh Cunningham, when I didn't get the football scholarship that I had no realistic chance of getting because I wasn't very good, he kept me in school. He kept me out of his own pocket. He got me odd jobs. Another big break, I got a job at the local radio station, 250 watt radio station in Huntsville, Texas. I got a break when I got out of the Marine Corps. I got on at the Houston Chronicle because they had a radio station and I worked there. The two biggest breaks for me journalistically were unquestionably the coverage of Hurricane Karla in September of 1961. 

That brought you to the attention of CBS? 

That got me to CBS News as a correspondent, and November 26, 1963, when President Kennedy was killed in Dallas. I had the responsibility for CBS's coverage in Dallas. Tragic as it was, journalistically, it was a break. 

Does it say something to you about destiny, about luck, about circumstance dictating life? 

Oh, I'll say it does. I've had an incredible run of luck and also God's grace. You can be in journalism. You can be very good and work hard and you can do a lot of the right things. If you don't happen to be in the right place at the right time, with the right people watching, you may never get a break. 

Yeah. This book is dedicated, "To my brother, Don and my sister, Patricia, who have dedicated their lives to teaching what we were taught." What were you taught? What was it your dad and your mom and your grandma taught you that made a difference? 

Things such as this: my grandmother, Paige, who got up every morning at 3:30 am to cook before she went to the fields to work in Bloomington, Texas, before I went to school, Charlie. I couldn't have been more than 4 and a half, 5 at most. She sat me down in the fields and she said, "Danny run your hands through the ground, through the soil. Feel the soil." She ran her hands through that deep, rich, black loam and had me do the same. What that gave me was a sense of being tied to the land. It was what the Indians, the Native Americans call "Touch the Earth." I was taught that. I was taught, "You stand up, shake their hand, look them in the eye, and tell them what you think." 

What was it she said about the trees and the breeze? 

That was also Grandmother Paige. Where she got it, I don't know. She would say, this was apropos of bad things happening to you, overcoming adversity. "Strong timber does not grow at ease. The stronger the breeze, the stronger the trees." 

I like Grandma Paige. Let me run ahead to CBS. I asked you before we went on the air about the time that you were at the White House and Roger Mudd was on the Hill. I think Bob Schieffer was at the Defense Department, and Marvin Kalb. Was that the best group of correspondents ever in one network at one time? You said, "No, it was probably Murrow, Collinwood and Murrow's voice." All of us now, in this business, look at Edward R. Murrow with some awe. It's almost a legend. It's almost bigger than the man. What was it for you, at the time, that made Murrow, and what he stood for, special? How did he imbue it within you? 

His standard of excellence, which is all the more astonishing because he was among the first broadcast journalists. He set such a high standard of excellence. That's number one. Two, his sense of integrity. Murrow, as with the rest of us, made his mistakes. He was the first to acknowledge them. He had the scars to show it. Someone wrote of Murrow that he frequently found himself caught between trying to do right and trying to do well. Boy, does that strike a chord when you're in prime time, big time television today. I think those two things, Charlie, are what has made the Murrow legend last. There have been any number of great correspondents, not all of them with CBS news, a lot of them with CBS news, but not all, since then, including Eric Severide, Bill Shirer, pound for pound, may be the greatest reporter, print or broadcast, of his time. He worked side-by-side with Murrow. 

At CBS early though after the war? 

Before the war, during the war. I think and Walter Cronkite left a tremendous record. What has made Murrow stand out, well over 50 years after he started, were the two things I mentioned. For me, I met Ed Murrow in the late 1950s when he came to Houston. I stood on an airport tarmac for a long time, his plane was late, so I could meet him. He had the ability to communicate that standard of excellence and that sense of integrity and, at the same time, a sense of vulnerability and even fragility when you spoke with him. I think that's why a lot of very intelligent, very good men and women, would crawl on broken glass for him, go to hell and back for him. 

Do you believe CBS News today is the place and reflects the values and the kind of institution that Murrow stood for? 

Yes. We've had a difficult time. We're still in a difficult time. We've made a lot of mistakes. I may not be objective about this, Charlie. I confess to a bias about this. As objectively as I can state it, I believe CBS News to be one, still the best worldwide news gathering organization day-in, day-out, year-in, year-out, in the world and two, does the best job of meeting the two standards I just said to you; a standard of excellence and integrity. 

Haven't you been quoted before as saying that, at least have been quoted, whether you said it or not, that that tradition has been tarnished? 

No, I never said tarnished. I say it gets tougher and tougher for anybody in broadcast journalism to meet the standards of excellence and the standards of integrity and ethics that were set before us. That includes CBS News. I think what I said was that the CBS tradition is the single most important thing we have. The second most important thing we have are a lot of dedicated people to meet that tradition, and that it gets ever more difficult to be consistent with our history, to meet our tradition. 

Why? 

One, because the business is in a cyclonic change. When I say the business, all of broadcasting, not just television news but all of broadcasting. This tremendous storm of change, which rages on even as we speak if you will, takes its toll. It's created confusion. It's created chaos. It's created fear. Frankly, I think you can't point to any one person. A lot of it's what's happened to American business as a whole. Some days I take a walk around the block at 57th Street. You know our building very, very well. It's not the best neighborhood in New York. I just walk around outside and say, "I don't want to be a person who doesn't stand for something." That's not consistent with the CBS News- 

Is it getting harder and harder for you to stand for something because of the pressures, both outside and internally? 

Of course it is. The candid answer to that is yes. 

There is a report that you have thought out loud with friends about, "Maybe it's time that I think about going." Do you have those thoughts? 

Of course I have those thoughts. I don't think I'd be very much of a person if I didn't have those thoughts. However, it's important to have those thoughts in context and perspective. That I talk that way to friends and close associates long before I became the anchor man and managing editor of the CBS Evening News, I think it's in the nature of what we do. I'm passionate about the news. I love the news and I like daily journalism. I had someone tell me in my 30s, "Well you ought to think about getting out of daily journalism because it's a young man's game, a young person's game." That's true to a degree, but I love it so. 

It's the daily (crosstalk) 

-- these kind of conversations. I sometimes say, "I want to do it for as long as I have a chance at excellence, a chance at quality." Some of that has to do with my age (on stage). Some of it has to do with the condition of the business. You know Charlie, and you know this so well because you're an excellent reporter yourself, what keeps me in it, to a very large degree and I think keep a lot of other people in it who really care about the news, is there's always one more story maybe just around the bend. 

Look what it's been like over the last 2 years. 

I was just going to say. Listen, I would have -- You get a story like Tiananmen Square. Once a career, if you're really lucky and God smiles, we had Tiananmen Square, the fall of The Wall- 

The Persian Gulf. 

-- the Persian Gulf War, the collapse of communism. 

The attempted coup. 

What kind of reporter would you be if you didn't want to be online with that kind of story. 

That's the pull though. Do you want to make sure it's your decision whether to stay or to go? That, in the end, you say about football coaches in Texas, there are only two kinds; those that have been fired and are about to be fired. 

That's true. 

Do you want to make it your decision that, "I'll tell them when I'm ready to go rather than them telling me it's time to go." 

Naturally, I would prefer that. That's not as important as however one goes and look, we all go. Some people never win and no person wins forever. We all know that. 

We all watch Jimmy Connors this fall. 

I take that. I thought he was terrific. Here's the point. However one goes, you'd like to go honorably. One of the things I think has gone out of the language a bit, we're all a little shy about talking about such things as integrity, honor, even courage anymore. I recognize that word's particularly difficult for me. 

I want to get to that. 

However it goes, I'm not thinking about going. I want this conversation, particularly this part of the conversation. It's very important to me. I love what I do. I like it. I like the people I work with. I'm at peace with myself. I try to be introspective and reflective. 

Nor do I want to put a conversation, the twist on this conversation as how long will Dan keep his job? As a good reporter, you want me to push on those things that have to do with the curiosity of people. Number one is many people wonder, when they hear stories about "Dan is more and more interested in 48 Hours- 

That's not true. 

-- and he moved his office up there." 

Okay. 

They say, "Dan's contract's up in 2 years." I'll give you an even better that at the end of 2 years, he'll make a decision to go somewhere else." Hence, the question. 

Call that bet. 

Call that bet? 

Call that bet. 

You think it's a good chance Dan Rather, 3 years from now, will be the anchorman of the CBS Evening News? 

Listen, overnight is a long time. A week is forever in television news. I have no idea what the situation will be 3 years from now. When I said call that bet, if Dan Rather has his health, he's going to be covering news somewhere. The odds are he'll be doing pretty close to what he's doing now, if he has very much to say about it. 

Do you think he'll have very much to say about it? 

I hope so and I think so. I don't want to be caught -- I think so. I'm happy where I am. Am I happy about everything? Of course not. Do I agree with every decision? Of course not. 

What are you most unhappy about? 

I'm most unhappy when I don't meet my own standard of excellence. 

Of course you are. 

That makes me unhappy. I'm also (crosstalk). 

When have you felt that, that you have not met your standard of excellence? When you look back over the- 

A lot of times. 

-- not the stuff of this book, which is what shaped you, but the stuff of the last 5 years that people talk most about. Where have you not met the standard? Where do you want to say, "Hey, let me rewrite that. I'd like to go back and change that a little bit." 

Boy, I wish you had a program long enough for me to list all the places. 

Give me a chance to understand some sense of- 

We didn't do a good job in the 1988 campaign. Look Charlie, you know and I know that most of us in journalism, in the 1988 Presidential campaign, provided coverage that was, at the very least, thoughtless and, in many ways, it was spineless. I didn't do a good job doing the 1988 campaign. I specifically do not except myself from this harsh criticism, nor do I except CBS News. I think we'll do better this time. That was a time. There were any number of times in the 1980s when I think everybody, and I do not except myself from this. I worry about this a lot. You say, "When did you think you did a good job?" We all got in the habit, and we allowed younger reporters to fall into the thought that your first responsibility is to curry favor with the person, institution or group you're covering. That's not the way it's supposed to be. My only client is the person in the living room who watches the CBS Evening News or 48 Hours. 

Your responsibility to them is what? 

My responsibility to them is to be accurate, be fair, report the news playing no favorites and pulling no punches. Now you and I know because we've had the day-to-day responsibility of doing it. All too often, we pull our punches. 

Pull our punches how? 

We pull our bunches because we defray. We say, "Well you know I ought to ask that question. If I do that, a lot of people are going to take it the wrong way. I may not get the next big interview. Maybe we'll just not ask that question this time." This gas, what I consider to be toxic gas, is out there in journalism. I hope things will swing back a little more the other way. I don't believe in being an attack dog, but I don't believe in being a lap dog. The ideal thing is, one of our roles is to fulfill the watchdog. Most of them said, "Well where do you think you failed?" Look, Charlie, you know I've made every mistake in the book at least 5 times. I've got the scars to prove it. 

We'll talk also about the things that you have done have been applauded well. Let me just, the Bush interview, any regrets? 

Oh sure. I have plenty of regrets. 

What? 

I wish I'd handled it better. 

How would you have handled it? 

I don't know how I could have handled it better. I said the next day afterward, "I wish it had ended better." I didn't have total control over that. No excuses. The responsibility was mine. I accept it. I came into that interview with some -- I made some wrong decisions. I made some wrong judgments. I came into that interview, first and foremost in my mind was, I thought I knew George Bush. I believed the Vice President would come to the interview with an answer to the question of how it was that shortly after the Ayatollah Khomeini killed 242 of our very best young people in Beirut, Lebanon, that we struck secret deals to send thousands of missiles to the Ayatollah. I didn't understand it. This is inexplicable. I thought he would come with an answer. I told my staff, "He'll have an answer to this." When he didn't have an answer to -- That was the basic thrust of the line of questioning- 

And it was like we are now, live. 

It was live. I don't think that was a mistake to go live. I know a lot of people who do. One of the things about daily journalism, you go out there every day. You do the best you can. Sometimes it turns out well. Sometimes it doesn't. 

As a good journalist, do you believe there was an October Surprise? 

I don't know. I know of no- 

Casey may have made a deal? 

The operative word there is "may." I'd like to know more about it. I'm open-minded about it. There is some evidence and some testimony that points in that direction, but that's not conclusive (crosstalk). We haven't followed up on that as much, nor as thoroughly, as we probably should have- 

Why not? 

-- particularly in the early going. A lot of reasons but again I get back on it part of it was fear. I was a little afraid to poke into that. 

Which brings me to another thing about CBS Evening News. Is it different today? Your best friend, or a good friend of yours, Tom Bettag is no longer there. He's no longer the Executive Producer. He is now the Executive Producer of guess what? Nightline, with Ted Koppel. Is it a different broadcast and is it a broadcast that's going in a direction that you approve of? 

Yes, it's a broadcast I approve of or I wouldn't be doing it. 

Okay. 

It's a broadcast that's headed in a direction I approve of. Listen, CBS Evening News has been a hard news broadcast. It is a hard news broadcast. It will be a hard news broadcast- 

How is it different? 

-- as long as I'm there. 

How is it different than when Tom Bettag was Executive Producer? 

I don't think there is a great deal of difference. 

Graphic difference? 

Certainly there's a use of graphics. There's a different use of the set. I don't consider those things dealing with our journalistic soul. That's what I'm concerned about. I know what you're getting at. 

Right. 

You're saying, "Listen is the CBS Evening News going soft?" The answer is unequivocally no. 

Mike Wallace, your colleague over at 60 Minutes, made a speech that got a lot of attention out at the RTNDA, which I think it was at the RTNDA, in which he said he's embarrassed, doesn't like local news that he sees here in New York. I think he was speaking around the country. It's too tabloid and it's not hard enough. Do you share that? 

Not completely. Mike and I agree about a lot of things. About this, we have a difference of opinion about this, which is that I think local news, by and large, is better now than it was say 12, 14 years ago. However, I do agree with Mike, and I've talked to him about it since he made that speech, that we need to keep reminding ourselves, and we need to remind others, that there is an audience for what you and I call for shorthand hard news. 

Yeah. 

Hard news can win. News of integrity, news that takes the attitude pull no punches, play no favorites, listen don't duck the tough question, it can find an audience. It can make money. It can show a profit. It can get ratings. As I understood what Mike was trying to get through, I think that was it. He was trying to keep that banner alive. 

In fact used some illustrations of where a hard news operation was winning in markets around the country. 

In that, I agree with him. 

Why do you think ABC News with Peter Jennings is number one now and Dan Rather at CBS Evening News is not number one in terms of the ratings? 

If you find a conclusive answer to that, call me collect, because I'm really interested. I don't know. 

Why do you think it is? It has to do with lead in. It has to do with local news. It also has to do with the nature of the newscast. It has something to do with the way you're covering the news and who's doing it and the anchorman. 

You begin with this. Peter Jennings is a very good journalist and a very good broadcaster. The evening news broadcast he does is a very good broadcast. ABC News is a good outfit and it's well-lead. You start from that. I salute them. My hat's off to them. Now there are a lot of other factors and I've made mistakes, we've made mistakes. Let's get all of that out on the table. The fact is, Charlie, that nobody knows what makes the ratings go up, down, and around. I said this when we led in the ratings for 212 or 13 straight weeks- 

This won't last forever. 

I said the same thing then. I have no idea why somebody watches us and doesn't watch the other. There are a lot of things that go into it, but I think the important thing, Charlie, and I try to keep in mind and I would encourage anybody else to gently, that ratings are one standard by which broadcasts and broadcasters are measured. There are other standards. The strongest, most important broadcast Ed Murrow ever did got among the lowest ratings. Harvest of Shame didn't knock him away in the ratings. 

Are your bosses at CBS listening to that kind of talk though or at NBC or at ABC? I don't mean to single out CBS. 

They listen. They're interested. I don't consider this a bulletin. I think most people know it. Most of them want to do the right thing. They also, every week in the New York Times, there's the rating scoreboard. There isn't a quality scoreboard that goes up in the newspaper. It's a rating scoreboard. Many times- 

It's harder to measure quality. 

-- the person I'm talking to says, "Listen Dan, I'd love to stick with what we're doing, which I think is good, solid journalism but if I stick with that, I may not be here more than 3 months. We're going to have to make a change." I used that, that's a hypothetical. I think that goes on in one form or another at every network around. 

Ken Auletta has got a new book out, called Three Blind Mice, which I suspect you have read. 

I have read it. 

He says that CBS talked to Peter Jennings in 1987 about coming to CBS News as a co-anchor. Did you know about that? 

Of course I knew about it. It was in the papers at the time. It takes nothing away from Ken (crosstalk) no, no, no. It takes nothing away from Ken to say that. Of course look, every network- 

I mean a lot of rumors about that. 

Yeah. Absolutely. 

CBS said, "What do you think about this?" 

Howard Stringer talked to me about it. 

You supported the idea? 

I said, "Listen if we can hire someone of his quality, let's get him." This happens all the time. I would have said the same thing if we would have had the chance to get Tom Brokaw or any one of 20 other- 

You would be happy to say, "If we can get a Brokaw, if we can get a Jennings, I'd be happy to share the anchor desk with them." 

Yes. 

You know- 

I might (crosstalk) the word happy. I'd be willing to. 

You'd be willing to? 

That's right. 

Be willing to, if they said to you, "Are you willing to do this?" You'd say, "Yes, if I guess the condition being, if you can convince me it will be a better broadcast." 

Sure. I would accept their judgment on that. This was no big deal then and it's no big deal now. The way it works in network television in years is when someone's contract comes up, other networks, they know that man or woman's work. There are a lot of opportunities for that person to move. 

You became the anchor at CBS News in part because (inaudible) very much wanted you to come to ABC? 

That's true. I'm forever indebted to him. That's the way it works. At that time, I guess Peter was not anchoring the broadcast at that time. I think Peter feels the same way. I've never talked to him about it, but I think he feels the same way. 

One more quick question about network news. Do you believe that there will be only 2 network news organizations or 2 network evening news broadcasts, not 3 but 2, 5 years from now? 

I think that may very well be the case. One of the things- 

What things will determine which one goes? 

I'm not sure about that. I think the one that has the weakest news performance and if one decides fundamentally to get out of the worldwide news gathering business, then I would think that's the one, worldwide news gathering as opposed to packaging, that may be the one that goes. What I try to spell out in the book and I remember is how quickly things change. I grew up in a period when my grandmother did not have electricity. I hadn't even heard of television. We stuck to the radio. Now everybody has television seemingly worldwide. Charlie, what we least expect frequently happens. What we most expect seldom occurs. I don't know what will happen 3 to 5 years from now, but I wouldn't be surprised if that situation prevails. 

Yeah. Let me come back to this book. I assume you wrote it in part, in addition to the things you've said, to give some sense of who Dan Rather was and what his roots are and what made a difference to him and what his father was like, I mean a man who dug ditches to lay pipe, but had values and cared about hard work and cared about standing up for who you are and what you believed in. When you think about yourself now, and having been in the public eye, does it still hurt when you hear some of the things that they say, that Dan is too stiff, or they talk about whether Dan is whatever. Does it hurt anymore or do you get immune to it? 

You never get immune to it. I don't know of anybody who gets immune to it, Charlie. 

Do you read it? 

Sure, you read it. What happens with experience is that you read it less and you pay less attention to it. As always, I want to try to be honest with you. Of course it hurts. Nobody's hide gets so thick that sometimes the errors don't get through. That's what I mean when I say that I, in doing this book, in writing about what I remember and reliving that period of rheumatic fever, listen we're all vulnerable. We're all fragile. The highest 17 zillion dollar a year executive feels vulnerable and fragile. The anchorman of anybody's broadcast feels the same. Now, the test is whether you can read that stuff, have all those things said, and we all know that a lot of those things have no basis in fact at all. That's what I spelled out and I remember. My father taught me to be a get up fighter. If you aren't a get up fighter, you'll never make it in network news. 

Yeah. Your life is proof of that. What's the biggest misconception do you think about Dan Rather? You paint the beginning here. Now bring it forward to some 50 years later. What's the biggest misconception? 

I don't know about the biggest misconception. I'll tell you one. I wrote it how I remember it. I meet a lot of people who say, "Dan, what part of New York are you from?" 

Yeah, I know. 

I was born in Wharton, Texas, which is just a bend in the river and grew up on the outskirts of Houston. Another is the, and there's been I think an effort to do this with news people in general, and that is to paint people. Some partisan political zealots, some of them very well paid and with a lot of weapons at their disposal, try to cast news people, particularly people who do the sort of thing I do, as "elite." Now many of these people, went to the best prep schools in the country and went to Ivy League colleges, which I think is terrific. I graduated from Sam Houston State Teacher's College. It has about as much ivy on it as your average McDonald's. I make a lot of mistakes on a lot of things, but elite is not one of them. 

I thank you. I count you and consider you and take pride in calling you a friend. I thank you for coming by to do this. 

Thank you very much, Charlie. Thanks a lot. 

Thank you. 

I enjoyed it. 

I Remember, by Dan Rather. As I said, a reporter that everybody pays respect to because of the stories he's covered and where he has been and the perspective he has brought to those stories.
