The White House fellowship has long been viewed as the Rhodes scholarship for American leadership and public service. The prestigious program offers a handful of individuals a unique opportunity to participate in government at its highest levels and many alumni, including retired General Colin Powell, have called the fellowship year the turning point in their life. Joining me now to discuss the White House fellowship experience and how the program is evolving are former fellows TOM JOHNSON, president of CNN; MICHAEL ARMCOST, president of the Brookings Institution; and current participants BRENDA BERKMAN, a firefighter from New York City; and STEPHANIE FERGUSON, a health policy researcher at the University of Virginia. I am pleased to have them here. Welcome one and all. 

(off-camera) Thank you, Charlie. 

Michael, let me begin with you. Tell me why you wanted to do this and what it's meant for you to have been a White House fellow. 

I was teaching foreign policy in a small college in California back in the '60s. The chairman of my department told me about the program. I wanted some exposure to Washington, to know, among other things, whether what I was teaching bore any resemblance to what actually went on. 

To the reality of policy making? 

This was a perfect way to discover that and I discovered in the process of that year that doing it was as much fun or more fun than writing about it. 

Yeah. 

And unlike most of the fellows, I stayed on. So I wound up spending 24 years in government. 

So it changed your life, too, dramatically. 

It changed my career completely. 

As Colin Powell said. Tom? 

Well, I was a young reporter on the Macon Telegraph, who had aspirations of one day becoming the head, perhaps, of a newspaper like the Macon Telegraph. But I saw that we were spending more of our column inches on government -- local government, state government, federal government -- than any topic and also noticing that in television, more of our air time was going to government. And I thought it would be very useful to go in on a fellowship year and, fortunately, the publisher of that newspaper agreed and it really was a tremendous experience, in terms of learning much more about an institution that has probably more effect on our lives than almost any other. 

How did it-- where did you go and what did you do and what kind of relationships did you form that made a difference? 

I was very lucky. I was chosen to work with Bill Moyers in the White House press office and I was used not only as an intern, but on virtually all matters during that year. It exposed me to reporters, many of whom are still around -- Helen Thomas is one example -- but also it exposed me to the president of the United States, to members of the Cabinet, members of the media, both inside and outside of Washington. It really was a mind-expanding experience of the first order. 

And when Bill left, you took over. 

I remained after Bill left, as deputy press secretary under George Christian, who also was another strong supporter of this program. 

And the relationship with Lyndon Johnson all grew out of that-- 

Yes. 

--that was an influential part of your own life. What do you like about it? 

Well, I-- I have enjoyed meeting not only my classmates, but former alums. It's been a marvelous-- it's a marvelous network that you'll never be able to forget. And I've also enjoyed being with Secretary Shalala this year. She's a wonderful mentor. She's an excellent leader, a visionary, and she's just-- being able to be there with her and shadow her and hang out with her and it's just something that you'll never forget and she's just been a wonderful person to be with. 

Is it different than you thought? 

It is different. 

Than you imagined. 

It is different. I had imagined that you would be at the highest level, so when I came into the program, I felt like that was something that I was going to be able to experience, but I also found out later that not everybody gets to shadow a secretary or a Cabinet member at the level and the extent that I've been able to. So I've been more than happy with the fact that I got to shadow her and be with her and hang out with her for the entire year. 

Is government different, though? 

Oh, government is much different. I had been an expert at state-level policy in Virginia and so coming into the federal level, if you will, looking at the political process and how it works-- it's a much bigger animal. But yet and still, it's an animal, in my opinion, that's one that we also need for a check and balance, but it's also one that you can see how you can go back to your own state -- like for me in Virginia -- and make a big difference in bridging the gap between some of the miscommunications and things that may happen, why people think that things may not work as well, sometimes, at the federal level at this time in life. And I'd like (unintelligible) 

Now, by this time in the program, people have listened to the three of you and they're saying, ''How do I do this?'' How did you get to be a White House fellow? 

Apply. 

Well, how did you know about it? 

It seems kind of simple-minded, but-- it was a fluke. For the first time in the 15 years that I'd been in the New York City Fire Department, I saw an announcement for the fellowship program on our department orders. 

Did you know anything about it at that time? 

Didn't know anything about it, didn't know a former fellow. 

Right. 

Wrote for the information, had one week to do my application -- I would not recommend this -- and applied. And when I found out what it involved, where you got to see the federal government operating at the highest level and I found out that it was really the premier leadership development program offered in the federal government, I was very interested. And then I found out who the alums were and I found out the nature of our educational program, because besides working in federal agencies, you also have an opportunity to do some travel. We went to South Africa and Mozambique and Panama this year and visited with governments, again, at the highest possible levels. And we had speakers, such as General Powell, and-- we didn't have 

It's hard to get Johnson, I can tell you! 

It's very hard to get TOM JOHNSON. 

We've been trying-- 

He's a busy guy. 

--for 10 years on this program. 

But that kind of-- that aspect of the fellowship program has been wonderful for me and it-- I came out of local government. I had spent 15 years working in emergency services and, frankly, I think the federal government could use a little bit of our life-and-death approach to problem solving because sometimes it seems like the wheels of government grind a little slowly. But it's been-- 

Firefighter's mentality might help the government? 

Yeah. Well, not-- 

A sense of urgency. 

Not the emergency part of it, but-- because we do plan. You know, we don't just rush out the door and do whatever comes-- first comes to mind. But it's been a tremendously broadening experience for me, both from the foreign policy level and from looking at the way that the federal government works. Hopefully, now I can go back to my local organization and bring to them, you know, a much deepened perspective on things. 

The man on your right and the man on your left, in a sense, stayed in Washington. What's the chance that you'll stay? 

In Washington? 

Yes. 

Not a chance. (crosstalk) 

Is that a comment on Washington or-- 

No, no. Not now, no. I would never rule anything out, but the purpose of the program is really to try and get people to go back to their organizations and bring that experience back to their organizations. Now, fellow alums have for many years, and will continue to go in and out of government and that's a benefit. 

Yeah. 

But the purpose of the program is leadership development and to take the young people and send them back to their organizations with the benefit of that wonderful year in Washington. 

Yeah. I was thinking-- I'm thinking about, I told you, doing a thing about leadership in a series of interviews, in terms of where do we train-- we know how the military goes about training leaders and we know how corporate America goes. But for the rest of the institutions in America-- journalism, the private-- the foundations, non-profit sector and government, how do they go about this process of leadership training? 

Well, I definitely think there is a major need to attract the most promising young people in our society into government. I can't think of a better way to do it than through this fellowship program. However, this program is not about leadership in government alone. It is about leadership in the professions and I think that we need to do more to help identify the people who really can make a difference, a difference in local government, state government, federal government, give them the encouragement and the type of fellowships we have here. This program has spawned many others on the state and local levels, as well. But I worry a lot about the state of our government today and I also worry about how few people seem to really want to go in and fix some of the problems that exist. This is one of the best parts of this program. 

Because-- you worry because of the cynicism and because of after Watergate and after Vietnam, there seemed to be a disenchantment with-- 

I worry about the concerns that many have not only about that, but about the ability to make it happen, to make it work, to get the bureaucracy to respond and do something. But I mean, there's no better example, though, than somebody who has really dealt with the problems of government than Mike. I mean, you know, ambassador to Japan, undersecretary of state. It's tough, but we need those people who will go in and try to make it work better. 

Do you sense that government is less attractive today than-- 

I think it was certainly true in the '60s. There was a sense of confidence about the efficacy of government that has been dissipated for 30 years. 

And today even the cynicism-- (crosstalk) And also, people talk about this notion of living in a fishbowl and everybody's life-- they don't want to subject their life and their family's life to that kind of environment. 

There's certainly a bigger harassment factor-- the forms you have of fill out, the conflict of interest, those kind of things. But basically, it's the question of whether or not the tasks are doable and confidence in government's ability at the federal level to do many of these jobs has declined. So that's part of the loss of-- 

Whether government can do-- 

Can do many of the things it's taken on. 

Even if it's to be a stimulus. 

Yeah. I think-- we've seen-- we've seen a 60-year growth in government and, to some degree, government probably took on tasks for which it was not well suited. So this is a time, it seems to me, for sorting out the definition to what government can do well and get rid of the things it does poorly or move them to a different level of government and that's taking place. But at a moment when the federal government's downsizing, when politicians and people in government are subject to a lot of bad press, when getting through the confirmation process is as complicated as you see in the morning paper-- (crosstalk) 

The Labor Department is a great example of that. I mean, I had no boss for six months because it took-- 

The confirmation process-- 

--six months for Secretary Herman to go through the confirmation process and, at some point, one might think she was even being held hostage for some concerns that were totally unrelated to her ability to be labor secretary. So you know, that's something that we've been able to see up close and personal. And we heard from Ted Sorenson this year and it was very interesting to listen to Mr. Sorenson talk about how he views the change in government and leadership in government from the time that he was working in the Kennedy administration till now. 

What did he say? 

Well, he said that-- you know, that there have been a lot of demoralizing factors for people who have sought to go into government and that there is this terrible cynicism that we can't accomplish anything in government. Now, one of the things that has really been inspiring to me this year is to see career and appointive people who are in there every day, slogging away, really trying to do a good job at the federal government for the American people and that's something you don't hear about very much out in New York City or in the states. 

The heroes within government. 

Exactly. And people who don't get any credit and they-- you know, they're not at the top, necessarily, and they go along and they still are doing their job and really trying. And that's not something that's reported in the media that often, the good news stories. 

Speak to Mr. Johnson! (crosstalk) Tom? 

But leadership-- I mean, leadership is needed and this program has identified one method of recognizing leadership and recognizing excellence and I hope that more people will apply for the White House fellows program. I hope that more people will share some of our enthusiasm about what we can do and how we can make a difference. I've worried a lot, as I've been on college campuses, that people don't have that same idealistic approach to public service that I think many of us have found to be so important. And if we don't work together to change it, there's going to be a very-- more difficult life for those who come behind us. And it isn't too late. 

Yeah. 

It isn't too late. 

Is government the best thing-- I mean, you've had a wonderful career-- an associate of Lyndon Johnson, Otis Chandler, Ted Turner, at important institutions-- some will say Jack Valenti, who was there when you were there-- that working in the White House, there is nothing like it, no matter what you do, the sense of being able to do well and do good is great. 

Well, I'm a news junkie and I have loved most of all my roles in the news profession, but it was a wonderful experience, the idea that a young, 23-year-old reporter from the Macon Telegraph could work for a year with people like Bill Moyers and Jack Valenti and LBJ and Joe Califano and Douglas Kater (sp? ) and many others-- I mean, it was a very enriching experience. I think I was able to go back to my profession much better for the experience. I also am a strong advocate of those going in and coming out. I think we owe it to our society to play an active part in helping to make our government better. I know many people in media think we need to stay away from it, that somehow we're contaminated if we go in. 

Church and state. 

But I really believe in fellowships of this type and I think, ultimately, society, as well as the people themselves, benefit from it. 

If it was your last lecture, what would you say about government service and an invitation to people-- 

The most exhilarating work you can do because the scale of the problems are bigger than you can take on in any other profession. You're dealing with the ultimate questions of the well-being of the country. I happened to work in the foreign policy field and that had a priority when I went in. The priorities have shifted, but the priority of government getting it right, it seems to me, remains critical to the quality of life in the country. Many people, I think, have discounted that, but if government gets it wrong, we all experience the consequences of that, so having people who, as Tom says, are dedicated to getting the best out of resources we put into government seem to make a huge contribution. And for my part, working on those big problems is something you rarely get back in the private sector. 

Do you want to come back? I mean, you're there as a White House fellow. You'll go back and you'll teach and then do you want to come back to government? 

Oh, I'm sure I will be back. I'm sure I will be. I'm a nurse and I think nursing, at this point, has a lot to add and to make a difference in this new health care delivery system that we're all dealing with called managed care and we will see Medicare, Medicaid and all different entrepreneurs and Welfare reform, all those different things change, particularly in my lifetime and all of our lifetimes. So I will definitely-- I look forward to coming back. 

Did somebody bring the White House fellow program to your attention or did you find it on your own? 

I actually-- when I was doing my doctoral internship at the Virginia Health Policy Center at the University of Virginia, one of my classmates, she heard it with me and she said, ''Stephanie, I think you ought to go for this.'' I actually looked at it as an opportunity for me, since I had been so active at the state level in Virginia, to do the White House fellowship and look at it as a post-doc almost, in the sense that I would come and-- firsthand experience in Washington and learn the federal process. So I-- I actually knew that I was going to try for it my last year in my doctoral program. 

Who do we give credit for this program to? Who deserves the credit? 

John Gardner (sp? ) gets credit for-- 

John Gardner? 

--thinking of the idea. I think-- 

Common Cause, Carnegie-- 

John Gardner was then the president of the Carnegie Corporation. He brought the idea to President Johnson. President Johnson embraced it enthusiastically. He said it reminded him a great deal of the time that he was given when he came up as a young aide to Congressman Clayburgh (sp? ) of Texas and he felt that it was terrific and he and Mrs. Johnson not only became big fans of the program during his time in the presidency, but really maintained their close association. 

Is it expanding? Is the funding there to make it bigger and better? Does anybody know? 

It's limited to, I believe it's 12 to 19 fellows per year. And you get a stipend. You're paid by the federal government. Over the years, the program has increased its outreach and resulted in more diversity. This is the first year-- our year is the first year where they've actually had more women fellows than men fellows. They've also expanded the racial diversity, the occupational diversity. I'm the first firefighter ever to have had it and-- 

Good for you. 

Well, it's-- they've had police officers, but they never had a firefighter before and they're looking for that. We have scientists, journalists, teachers, people from all different walks of life and they're looking for that breadth of experience to bring to the program so that those people will then represent different segments of the community to the federal government, as well. 

Much success to both of you. 

Thank you. 

Michael, thank you for coming. Tom, it's great to see you. 

Thank you, Charlie. 

White House fellows program-- if you want to inquire, call the White House. I'm sure they can direct you as to the person-- is it through the White House? 

(off-camera) Yes. 

And they'll direct you to the appropriate people to be considered. Thank you again. 

(off-camera) Thank you, Charlie.
