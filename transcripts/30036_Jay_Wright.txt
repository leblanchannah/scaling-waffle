Tomorrow is March 1st. The first day of the month of the NCAA tournament. Villanova University is seeking to repeat as national champions. The Wildcats won in dramatic fashion last year after a buzzer beater to defeat North Carolina. It's already considered one of the signature moments in college basketball history. Joining me now is Jay Wright, he's the head coach of the Villanova Wildcats, and he captures last year's journey to the title and much more in a new book called "Attitude." Welcome to you, Jay. 

Thanks so much. Good to be here. 

Set the feel for us. We're just a few weeks away from the start of the tournament. Is it a wide-open race and how does Villanova fit into that? 

It is a wide-open race. And I think each year it's becoming more and more that way. Last year when we won it, it was wide open, I think it's more wide open this year. You've got Kansas as one of the top teams. Gonzaga is one of the top teams. We're one of the top teams right now, but any one of us can be beaten, and it's been proven. But any one of us could win it. I think it's up to 16 teams that could win it this year. 

Is there a reason structurally in college basketball why it's more open perhaps than in the past? 

I think the one and done players make the top teams that get them, the Kentuckys, the Dukes, it makes them talented, but a little vulnerable, in that, if those guys stay for three years, they might be untouchable. But they're really talented, well coached, but an older team can get them sometimes, and it creates a balance, right? Back in the day when John Wooden was there at UCLA, they were getting all those guys and they're staying all four years, and it would get to the point where they were untouchable. But now, there is a good balance between young teams and experienced teams. 

And that seemed to be the formula you had last year. 

Yes. 

You don't have a lot of great one-and-done players, you've got a solid, great team. So how do you develop that team? You know, there is an old basketball saying that nothing fails like success. How do you keep your edge going into that second year knowing -- you've got a book, you've got the championship, how do you keep it and how do you adapt? 

It's the greatest challenge that faces us this year, not our opponents, you know, the expectations, the outside distractions, and we addressed it immediately in the locker room following the championship game. One of the first things we did, I talk about it in the book, was we hold hands to say a prayer after we get into the locker room. Now, in the championship game, that's about an hour after the game. You're on the court for so much celebration and fanfare and presentation, you finally get back into the locker room with your team. We hold hands to say a prayer. One of the first things we say was, look, let's make sure that this doesn't define you as an individual. Let's make sure that this ring isn't the most important thing you have in your life. Let's take what we've learned here and make sure we're able to do other things in life based on all the characteristics we used to do this. So right away, we were kind of starting on the fact that it's how we handle this that's going to be important going forward and that's what our guys have done a good job of this season. We address that everyone's going to talk to us about repeating, everyone's going to talk to us about winning a national championship, everyone's going to talk to us about the NCA tournament, much like we are now. We have to have the mental discipline to focus on today's work ethic, today's challenge, and one day it might be practice, the next day it might be a game against Georgetown. But no one else is going to be talking about that or focusing on that except us. That's our challenge this year. 

Have you faltered at all at that exercise? 

I think at times we have all slipped. We had three losses this year. I think each one of those losses, there was a time in those games where our confidence got to us. We led in the second half of all three of our losses. I think there's a time where our confidence became a negative. It wasn't arrogance, it was more, OK, we've been here before, we've got a lead in the second half. This is what we do. We finish these. Instead of focusing on what do we have to do the next possession to make it the best possession we've ever played. And when you slip there a little bit, that's where you're vulnerable. So, as long as you address it afterwards, we're human, we slipped, all right, doesn't make us bad guys, but let's admit it and let's learn from it. 

Right. There is an interesting line in your book and you don't expand on it much, but you said, at one point, I thought I was better than I was. How did you go about the journey to find out how good you were and, in a way, who you were, when you think about that young coach or that young player who perhaps though he was better than he was? 

I think we all do that when we attain some levels of success, we only look at what we did to get there, whether it be individually or even a team. A team not recognizing that all the other people around them that they are a part of that. And most importantly, the culture that's around them. I think there was a time when we went to our first Final Four where I thought, I've got this now, I've got it. I know what we have to do. And I didn't pay attention to as much the process of every day getting better and continuing to improve and evolve. And it caught up to us. We had a bad year. And I think as long as you go back to being honest and assessing your role in everything, right, at first, before you look at someone else that's around you, I think you can grow and get better and you can always recover. 

How does a winning attitude handle the negative emotions that we all have, disappointment, blame, anger? I could go on and on. But those are present for everyone and they're present in teams. What are the concrete things that you think about and you say to your team about those emotions when they surface? 

It's the most important aspect of our program. That's why the book's called "Attitude." We wear "Attitude" wristbands. And when we break a huddle since our days at Hofstra, we say one, two, three, attitude. What we're reminding ourselves is, we're not responsible for the results of whatever happens. We're responsible for our effort and we're responsible for our attitude going forward. So as we get guys at 18 years old that come in, they're basketball players. They're not -- they know they're supposed to get their degree and they want to get an education, but when they first come, they're thinking basketball. So we first try to teach them on the court, the play that you make is not as important to us as how you react on the next play. That's what's most important to us. That's what we want you to use that attitude to separate you from other players. 

Coach Kay has a similar philosophy, next play, right? Same idea. 

Exactly. 

So how do you apply that to your everyday life? So, go on. 

So we chart in practice every drill we do. We keep score, but there's attitude points. The other team gets points. If you turn the ball over, the other team gets a point. But if you turn the ball over and you go back and don't hustle, or you make a face or there is a bad call, and you complain, that's two points for the other team. So we're monitoring how you react to negative situations, but also if you make a three -- 

You celebrate. 

-- and you give a three point shot and celebrate, we want you to take any energy you have, don't give it to the crowd, take that energy and give it to your team. We want you to hit a three and say, let's get a stop on this next play. 

Do you think attitude points could ever apply in a corporate setting or a work setting? 

I think, I do. I think valuing people's commitment to the core values of the organization, valuing their commitment to one another, and how they respond to success. We have a term "hungry and humble" that we wear wristbands, too, that when we have success, we've got to respond in a humble and hungry way. When we have failure, we've got to respond with a positive attitude. I think in an organization, you can find the people that in short term might not be having success numerically, but if you see their approach every day, you trust that their attitude is going to carry them to big-time success later. 

I've got one challenge though to what you're saying, and that is basketball is this beautiful game of flow and creativity and motion. How do you keep that vibe going and yet still have discipline? It feels like there is some value in being expressive. 

Yes, and it's a creativity that comes with a free mind. Athletes are the most successful when their minds are clear. And if you have -- what that attitude gives you on the next play is a clear mind to make decisions that have not -- are not affected at all by what you did previously. A great example is, in our championship game against Carolina, we had a ten-point lead going down the stretch in the biggest game of the year. We blow the lead, so we make mistakes. Then we're up three with 13 seconds to go, we call time out. In the huddle we say, in a more articulate basketball way, we say the only thing we can do to screw up here is give up a three. We can foul. We can give up a two. We gave up a three. On an incredible shot. Our guys came back to the huddle, and they were looking each other in the eye just saying attitude, attitude. That's what we do to tell each other forget that last play, let's go into the next play with a clear mind. And we started the next play with 4.7 seconds. I wasn't sure Chris Jenkins would make that shot. But I was really proud of how clear their minds were. And I knew whatever decisions they made, it wasn't going to be affected by fear of failure because of the previous play. 

Interesting. Who has more sway in the locker room? Is it you or the smartphone? 

That's good. I like to get it to the point where the most sway comes from our seniors. I like to get it to that point by the end of the season. And it takes a lot of work. The smartphone is involved in that. 

Do you say they can't use the phones during the season? 

We take -- when we're on the road the night before the game, we take the phones from them. When they come into the locker room, we have a place where they put the phones and the managers keep them, because we want all their concentration once we -- we get into the locker room an hour and 45 before the game. We want all their concentration to be on each other. And even listening to music by themselves, we don't do that. 

Oh, that's interesting. 

Because we want them to be vibing with each other and we want them to be connected to each other. Now, as soon as the game is over, they get it, and I know they're on it. But we have an hour and 45 there and as I said the night before the game in bed, we want their concentration to be on the game and each other. 

Are there players you won't recruit? And why not? 

Yeah, there is a lot of players. There is a lot of players that don't want us, too. (LAUGHTER) But we really try to find someone that is going to thrive in our culture. We had a lot of success going to about 2009, we went to the Final Four. A couple of years after that, a lot of success. Then we got to the point it was kind of easy to get the top players and I didn't, as a head coach and the head of our organization, I didn't vet those players and I didn't explain to them what the culture was. I know the culture. They don't. It's not their fault. I have to make sure I'm bringing in people that I know will be successful in that culture and comfortable. If I'm not explaining it to a 16-year-old kid when he's making his decision, that's on me. And I didn't. We got some guys that it wasn't their fault, we just put them in a tough situation. So, we spend a lot of time getting close to guys and then getting to know them real well and realizing, you know what, they might not know it but this probably isn't a good fit. 

What do you do during the commercials during the tournament? Do you go nuts like the rest of us? They go on too long, right? 

It's a significant difference than the regular season, obviously. 

Absolutely. 

So, in the NCA tournament, we will spend a lot more time talking to our staff, first. Because for me, I don't want to be in front of those guys too long because I might have some things that I'm frustrated about that we're doing it. It's really not the time to share with them, but if you give me too much time, it's going to come out and it's not good. So I get with the coaches for a while and then I go in there, talk with the guys, and get them out of there. They are too long, I agree. 

But just as a fan, if you're not in the game or at a tournament, and you're watching, it goes on forever. 

It does, I agree. But even for the coaches and the players. 

Right. 

We don't want to sit there that long, we really don't, especially in the middle of the game. 

But it's built around the money necessary to support the NCAA. 

Definitely. 

How do you feel about the level of commercialization that has penetrated the sport, in particular the tournament? 

It's something that we discuss with our players, we discuss it a lot because there is a lot of things with the commercialization of the game and the publicity that you get. For an 18-year-old to 22-year-old kid you're trying to teach values of humility, right, and hard work, and not being about yourself, living for others, all of that goes completely against what you're teaching, you know, so we talk about it. We say, look, we get to play -- our home court in Philadelphia at the Wells Fargo Center, we get to play in front of 20,000 people, right? We travel on charter planes and stay in the best hotels. If not for all this, we are not doing that, so this is part of the business of it. But our main goal here is to be the best men we can be, to get our degree, be the best educated people we can be, and be the best players we can be. We've got to separate those two. 

But it's got to be hard, I mean, you mentioned in your book, you've had rap concerts to kick off the season. I think you said 50 Cent and Drake were there. 

Yes. 

Do you ever sit and watch this concert and say, my Lord, what in the world does this have to do with basketball? 

Definitely. 

So why don't you stop it? 

Because it is a part of sport now. Sport has become entertainment. So, how do you want to do it? Do you want to fight it? You know, if you fight it, you're not going to get the players that allow you to compete in it. What we try to do is separate the competition. We have a saying, actors play to the crowd, players play for their teammates and coaches. Once we get on the court, that hour and 45 before the game we talked about, everything is about playing for your teammates and coaches. So we don't want any of our guys pumping their shirts or pointing to their back or pointing to the crowd to win the game. That's getting caught up in commercialization. After it's over, we have to meet with the media, we do our TV, we do all that, it's part of the game. 

Should the players be paid? 

In college, I don't think so. 

Why not? 

I think we have a unique system of amateur athletics that our guys get a great education -- and let me back up on that. As long as we are held responsible for educating them, they shouldn't be paid. If we're not going to educate them, then they should be paid. But if we are held responsible as coaches to educate these guys, we have 100 percent graduation rate of every player who's stayed for four years has gotten his degree on time. We take great pride in that. That's why I say, giving them a Villanova education that is probably worth $300,000 now over four years, and preparing them for the real world with all the travel, the food, the coaching, everything they get, I do think it's fair. 

But they also have a tremendous commitment to you, to the team in terms of hours spent in practice. They're not hanging out and having a great time like most kids in college are, they are cut to live a very disciplined life. 

I disagree with that. I think they are having a great time. I think they do put in a lot of time. They get the best training for their professional careers. Every player that plays at Villanova is either going to play in the NBA or going to play professionally in Europe. We have a part of our program called "Life After Basketball," where we're committed to them after they play professionally. So we have a system set up that, when they start thinking about retiring, we start getting internships set up for them for the next part of their life. That's our commitment. Now, if we're not doing that, then they should be paid because then they're not getting the value of their efforts. 

It seems, though, for the average fan who's sitting there through the interminable commercials... (LAUGHTER) And counting the dollars, clicking over, saying, man, these players should be paid. And it feels that at least in the courts and the public opinion, that's where it is headed. 

I agree. I agree that -- here's what I think there. I think there are few players that really add to that and go on to be professional, they add a lot of the value. I think those guys should be allowed to go to the NBA right out of high school. If you choose -- and I think the NBA is doing a good job with their D League where they could take some of those kids and develop them, and some of those kids wouldn't have to go to college. If you don't want to go, you shouldn't have to go just because you want to be a basketball player. They should be able to go right out of high school. If you go to college, you should be committed for three years, and much like the baseball model. And then you wouldn't have those guys that maybe get so much attention that are making the money -- I think you would see the schools will get the same amount of money without those guys and those high-level guys or pros would be getting paid what they're worth, I think it would be a more fair system. 

Let's make it commissioner for a moment, not that there is commissioner of college basketball, but we know that attendance is largely down, maybe not at Villanova, but college basketball generally, TV ratings not great, they are not doing so well. There is something amiss in the sport. 

Right. 

What needs to be changed? 

I think what you're talking about is the result of a lot more content on TV, all right. So people don't go as much because every game is on TV. I think that the TV ratings seem -- you know, you get so many games on you can't watch them all. So I don't think -- I don't think it's a miss, I think, when you see the NCA tournament and you see the passion for that event, when that starts to fade, if that event isn't what it is to our country, then I think something is wrong in college basketball. Because you can still watch games at the lower levels of division one, even division three, they still get great following. I think college basketball is alive and well. I think what we have to solve is there are certain guys who should be professionals and they're stuck going to college because of the rule. 

Who were you when you were a 25-year-old coach, and who are you today many years later? How have you changed? 

25 years old, I was an assistant to Coach Massimino at Villanova and watching this great coach who won a national championship do some things and think, at 25, why the hell would he do that? You know, I've got all these ideas, you know, I would never do that. And all these years later, I find myself doing some of the same things. 

Turning into your father. 

Yes. But understanding -- and I did understand some years before, if you look at anybody in any situation, it's not just his decisions, he's a part of something and that culture he's a part of dictates some of his decisions, and what you need to do as head coach is define your culture. If your culture is defined and your values are clear, your decisions are easier. And I found that, as a leader, what I have to do is define how we're going to live, not just how we're going to play basketball, but what is our -- what is our motto going to be? What is our core values going to be? How are we going to live every day not just as coaches and players but as a family and as men in this world? So I definitely changed my thinking a lot. 

So you're okay having become your professional father, more or less? (LAUGHTER) 

A refined edition of my professional father. 

Fair enough. Last question. Championship or bust this year for Villanova? 

No, not at all. We just -- we have to become the best team we can possibly be, given everything that goes on around us, and that's always been our goal. Last year, our goal wasn't win a national championship, it was be the best team we could be, and take on every challenge. And we did. But the year before, we did too, and we lost in the second round. And I'll be proud of our guys -- I told them that -- if we don't win it this year, but we give the effort and the commitment to be the best we can be, I'm good.

Great talking with you, thanks.
