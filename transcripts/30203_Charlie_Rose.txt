Thank you very much. It's always good to see you, Charlie. 

Nathan Lane, Mouse Hunt. Back in a moment. Playing Jackie Brown Pam Grier stars in Quentin Tarantino's latest film, Jackie Brown. A long-time fan of her work in such '70s classics as Coffee and Foxy Brown, Tarantino wrote the script with Grier specifically in mind. It is based on the 1995 Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch, and it will open on Christmas Day. She was also -- get this, ladies and gentlemen -- just nominated for a Golden Globe award as Best Actress in a Comedy or a Musical, so we are doubly pleased to have her on this little, old broadcast this evening. Welcome. 

Oh, thank you. 

Congratulations. 

Oh, thank you. Thank you-- 

Hey, that's not bad, huh? 

--so much. Thank you, QT 

Yeah, thank you, QT! (crosstalk) What do you call him? 

QT. 

Oh, man, that's not bad, a nomination right here. 

Oh, no. It's fantastic. 

As well as Samuel L. Jackson. Two. 

I know. 

Two actors-- 

And the Best Director, right there, and the Best Writer, right there. 

What makes him-- I mean, I don't want to talk about him. We've talked about him. (crosstalk) Let's talk about you. What was this like for you? You know, he told me the story that when he called you up and said, ''I got something for you'' and you said, ''Well, I'm busy. I mean, I got a lot of stuff to do,'' and ''Hey, man, you got something for me,'' you know, ''get in line.'' And he said, ''No, I got something really big for you,'' right? 

Yeah. Yeah. 

Yeah. Was it-- 

It was really big and he, you know, was-- he's a director and writer in demand, right? The biggest stars, the biggest people want him. 

Right. 

And he's going to tell me he's going to invest two years of his life to write something for me and I'm going to believe it? And then he tells me again, another year later, ''I'm going to''-- ''Okay, now, this has got to stop, okay?'' You know, ''Don't-- don't break my little heart. Don't''-- you know? And then one day he calls and he says, ''I'm going to send you something.'' You know, ''Read the role, Jackie Brown. Tell me what you think,'' you know? ''Okay.'' It doesn't come right away. I'm, like-- I'm not-- because it took him two years and I'm just going to sit here coolly, not-- you know, get-- I'm going to get sleep. I'm going to relax. And then it came and there it is and it's, like-- first, I always look at the end of the script to see how many pages, then I flip through and see how many-- how many pages I'm on. Then I go-- 

Two hundred and sixty-seven-- (crosstalk) 

I'm going, ''Oh, wow.'' And I'm like this and I'm, like, ''Oh, my God. This is it. Quentin Tarantino.'' I'm, like, ''Whew!'' And I started reading it and I'm reading it and I'm looking, like, ''No.'' Elmore Leonard is one of the most prolific writers. I mean, you can smell and taste and feel his characters on the page and now they're popping out and Quentin's-- it's, like, so mind-boggling. ''I'm going to have to read it again.'' And I'm just overwhelmed, I mean, by the sheer fact that someone would sit down and write something for me and have the confidence and say, ''Here, read it.'' First, ''Read it.'' I'm thinking-- I didn't tell him-- I didn't call him right away to tell him how good it was and that his style-- because I was so afraid he'd say, ''Well, I just wanted you to read it and see if you liked it and we're not going to do it and I just wanted to see, you know, if you liked it.'' And I was, like, ''Oh!'' because I don't want to have my heart broken on something that is so good, you know? And I understand that I-- I didn't call him right away, so Quentin was thinking I didn't like it and he's, like, ''Oh, my God. She hasn't called. She didn't like it.'' And so finally, my boyfriend, Kevin, said, ''I think you better call Quentin and let him know that you liked it before he casts anybody else.'' (crosstalk) And I said, ''You know what? You're right, Kevin, again.'' I call him up-- 

Again! 

I call him up and-- and I tell Quentin-- you know, and it's, like, (unintelligible) I'm stumbling. I don't know how to say it from my heart , you know, the depths of my heart, my gratitude. And I told him, I said, ''You did a really good job. You did really good work and it's your style'' and it was-- you know, the book, this novel, in adapting it to his style, screenplay, how you work it and everything, the characters and-- that's some work. That-- I mean, it's a monumental effort. And I just told him, I said, ''This is so great,'' you know? I said, ''I love it.'' He says, ''Well, you're Jackie Brown.'' 

Do you have-- speaking of that-- I mean, he sat here and talked in a conversation we did together about needing a Pam Grier for this -- didn't think of anybody else -- because of some sense of presence, command that you have. Do you feel that? Do you know that about yourself, I mean, that you are-- 

I was-- I've been informed, yeah. When I do the work-- 

What do you feel? You internalize-- 

Yes. 

You know it. 

Yes. 

You know that-- 

I know it more now. I didn't have-- 

--you've got a presence. 

I know more now. I don't-- I didn't have a real strong sense of self and it's not that I didn't believe in myself, but I know what I do, but I learn more from the reaction that people give me that I did the work, all the-- you know, I mattered. I let other people tell me because sometimes I really don't know what I do because I'm in the moment and I'm really not thinking of how well I did or what did I do. So other people inform me that I-- there-- of my presence and-- and I've just never really thought of that. Other people make me aware. Quentin-- he's always telling me about, ''You have this. You do that''-- (crosstalk) And I go, ''Oh, really?'' 

Yeah. 

''Really?' ' 

When you made all those-- how many films did you make that are now called ''blaxploitation'' films? 

I would say about four, three or four. There was Coffee, Foxy Brown and Sheba and I don't know if you include Scream, Blacula, Scream or Friday Foster. I think the ''blaxploitation'' ones were meant for the-- the amount sexuality and action and the jokes, tongue-in-cheek, you know, adult-- adults' entertainment. I think just three, really. 

When those ended, when that sort of demand for those ended, what did you think about where you were going to go? And is that where you went? 

Well, for me, personally and professionally, I chose not to do them anymore because it's not that I was ashamed of them or didn't like them. I really-- I adored them, I loved them, because they really exemplified pop culture, African-American pop culture at that time-- 

Right. 

--because the '70s really was the basic rewards for the '50s and '60s political games. So we went crazy with music and Afros and hair and we were part of the sexual movement and the women's movement. And so I really enjoyed it and I look upon it very favorably and I've never been embarrassed by it because my work-- I was a novice. 

Yeah. 

You know, I wasn't really well-studied and well-trained. But I look at them as something that exemplified and documented the culture and it was something that I look forward to just-- what is it going to say at the end of the day? What are people going to really think of it? I don't really know. All I know is it's about us and it's about me and, you know, I'm the type of person, I can't-- I let everybody think about, you know, what they are to them because-- (crosstalk) 

Pam has a really unique place in film history, though, with the films that she did in the ''blaxploitation'' time because they had a whole, like, star system set up in the black-- in the black pictures, you know? Jim Brown, Fred Williamson, Jim Kelly-- these were all big stars and Pam was one of the hugest ones there was. But with Jim Brown, like, for instance, if people were doing an article about him, they'd refer to him as ''the black Clint Eastwood'' and they could refer to Fred Williamson as, like, ''the black Burt Reynolds'' or Jim Kelly as ''the black Bruce Lee.'' They could never find a white-- even though they bent over backwards, they could never find a white equivalent for who-- what Pam's star was, for what she was, because there really wasn't a white action female hero, star, you know, that her name was above the title, ''Pam Grier is Coffee,'' ''Pam Grier is Foxy Brown,'' that people would go and see, to see her in this action role. But it wasn't one like it before and when she stopped making them, there wasn't anybody to take her place. She really owned a spot for women in the '70s with those films that America had really never seen before or since. 

And I didn't want to be redundant because I had already made-- said what I needed to said. And if I continued-- if I continued-- we had already found the black audience-- 

Right. 

--and they're following it and becoming more astute each time they see a movie and we're starting to lose them now because everybody is jumping on the same formula I'm working on at American International Pictures. Now I can see because they're coming to me and saying, ''Why can't we do something different? Why can't we say something different?'' And now I feel that they're getting bored and that's when I decided to say, ''You know what? I need to go to another level. I need to find out where I can go and where I can take this audience.'' 

I want to pick that up in just a moment. Take a look at this. Just in case you have not seen what we're talking about, here is Foxy Brown. 

What are you doing in here? I asked you to wait for me. 1st 

I needed a drink. 

Well, you're going to Seattle with your old man. He's waiting for you at the airport, so come on. 2nd 

Hey, wait a minute, bitch! Why don't you go find one of your own? 

Now, you wait a minute. This is none of your business. 2nd 

Listen, skinny, before you start talking tough, I better warn you I got a black belt in karate, so why don't you get out of here quietly while you've still got some teeth left in that ugly face. 

And I got my black belt in bar stools! Come on, Claudia, let's get out of here. 3rd 

Hold it. I don't like what you just did. Bobby happens to be a friend of ours. 

Then maybe you'd like a little taste of what she just got. 4th 

Leave her alone, Jackie. They're friends of ours. (general melee) 3rd Let go of my hair, bitch! 

Come on, let's (unintelligible) I come from a long line of skillet-throwing women, you know, so-- 

Yeah. 

I-- aerobics in the '70s. 

Yeah. What did you do after that? So you decided to take control, to go a different direction. What happened? 

Right. Well, I was growing as an actor and, you know, finding my sense of self and redefining who I was as a person. And you see a lot of that and you understand the political agenda of people saying, ''Why don't you do more dramatic, historical pieces? Why don't you''-- you know, because now I've got an audience. I've got the attention of the filmmakers, the producers behind me. And then that's what I started asking. ''Well, what do you think about making something like those?'' And they said, ''No, let's stick to the''-- you know, ''Let's sell the action'' and this and that. And I said, ''Well, you're going to lose the audience.'' So by then, I was backing out of it and whatever happened to the other filmmakers and Jim Brown and Fred and then-- that was, you know, their own choice. But I had to move on personally and professionally. 

Do you think there's a market-- I mean, I've often been amazed at what I think is out there in terms of the buying power of the African-American community-- buying power, you know? 

Right. Exactly. 

Huge demand, huge influence in terms of television, in terms of people who watch television, influence television. Is it being served, so to speak? I mean, do you think the movies that are being made today are responsive to what that market is? 

Uh-huh. 

You know? 

Soul Food was made. 

Yeah. 

Eve's Bayou. 

Yeah. Which I haven't seen, but everybody says Samuel L. Jackson-- (crosstalk) Have you seen it? 

Yes. 

I haven't seen it yet. I want to see it. 

Yes, I have. It's glorious, from Julie Dash (sp? ) to-- there's so many, you know, films that are coming out, not-- well, like you said, it's the box office, the demand, and who's going to pay for them. 

Right. 

You know, there's only so much money, so much time and so much creativity. I don't know if we're serving them en mass, but it's coming-- 

Yeah. 

There are more and more different, diverse films that are coming out. And you'll see from some of the plays that are coming out that are going to be turned into films, from Fences and-- I just think it's-- it's slow. 

Fences is being made into a film? 

Fences will be-- 

August Wilson? 

Yeah. 

Yeah. 

And so it takes time, but it also is something that's not overnight and I don't know who's controlling what, when, where and how. But as long as they get made-- 

Yeah. 

You know-- 

--that's important. 

It's very interesting, also-- Spike Lee had said something when he had done She's Gotta Have It. It was about the time when he came out with She's Gotta Have It. That was probably the longest period of time that, basically, black culture had really not been reflected in the Hollywood mainstream unless you're considering Eddie Murphy, all right, okay-- 

Yeah. 

--with the exception of Eddie Murphy, all right, you know, for, like, a large chunk of the '80s-- I mean, I'm even surprised that blacks went to the movies at all. I can't believe that they, you know, would go and not see themselves represented on the screen. And Spike Lee said something-- when he did She's Gotta Have It, he said that black audiences were getting sort of overwhelmed watching She's Gotta Have It because it had been that-- it had been so long since they'd seen black people kissing on screen. Think about that. 

Uh-huh. Sure. 

Think about that, never seeing your own people reflected even in a kiss on screen. 

A love scene. 

Yeah. 

You didn't see that often and you didn't see them very much in my films. A little later, but no, it's-- it was really rare. And they talk about that today, not enough passionate love scenes. But in Eve's Bayou you see it. You're seeing it more and more, in Soul Food. It's just not-- 

But they did it in your movies. They did it in your movies. They did it in the '70s. But there was just this period where they-- blacks weren't being represented on the screen. 

Well, in the '80s, definitely, it was a very rigid time, a very conservative time, a very Republican time, where the themes weren't about people of color. They were basically about, like, mainstream box office dollars. 

What would you like to come out of this experience in Jackie Brown? What do you hope it achieves? 

Well, it has achieved quite a bit, the fact that when Quentin asked me to portray Jackie Brown-- and he's going to demand a lot of me, of Pam, and my-- my tenure on this planet, my commitment to the role, to work with him and Samuel Jackson, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton, Bridget and Robert Forster, and to show a lot of me, reveal a lot of me that I haven't revealed and not asked to. Quentin allowed me to go certain places as an actor that no other director would-- would-- had required or asked. And I've achieved personally and professionally so much. And if the audience enjoys it and they feel what I've felt and I have brought-- given depth and texture and color and pain and all kinds of emotionality of mine to Jackie and people can feel it and they go, ''Yeah, I feel Jackie. I've had those days. I've lost things. I've gained this,'' and they come away saying, ''I really enjoyed seeing that character'' because there's not a lot of character-driven movies. It's usually action. You don't get to know the characters. You think they're robots. You think they're one-dimensional. There's a dimension-- so many dimensions to Jackie. At the end of the day, all I wanted to do was a good job. 

Did it cause you-- does it cause you, knowing the reaction, to change your dreams? 

Well, as far as changing my dreams, my dreams of? 

What you want to do and how you see your own-- 

Well, I've never dreamt about getting the big part. I think I've never dreamt of working with anyone, although in reality, I would like to and hope I get the opportunity to. 

See, but that's what I mean. I mean-- 

Oh, a dream? If it's a dream? Yeah, the-- 

I mean, you never thought about working with De Niro, for example, or-- 

No. No. And I had met him as a person outside of the business. And if you're considering, you know, like, those type of dreams-- to be a part of the fabric-- 

Yeah. 

--of the industry, to be another texture from, you know, my-- not only my upbringing, my humor, being-- living in Europe, living in America, all the different textures that people can bring to the industry-- that's-- that's all, you know, I can do. And I just want them to see that I can do it well. It's not that I don't have aspirations. I do. I love writing. I have screenplays I'd like to, you know, get off the ground. And there's people I would like to work with, but it's something that if it didn't happen, I'd be okay. 

You're going to be okay. Thank you for coming. 

Thank you for inviting me. 

It's a pleasure to have you here. Pam Grier stars in Jackie Brown. And thank you, sir. 

My pleasure. 

Great to have you here. Here's a clip from Jackie Brown. 

I need permission to leave the country so I can keep my job. 

Oh. I can look into that. 

I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired. 

Well, you know what we want. 

If I'm working, I can help you. 

Help us do what, Jackie? 

Help you get Ordell Robbiey. 

(unintelligible) you do know him. 

You never asked if I did or not. 

You're telling us now that you do know him. 

Well, of course, I do. I deliver money for him. 

You know how he makes his money? 

He sells guns. 

You ever seen him sell guns? 

No. 

Then how do you know he sells guns? 

He told me. Besides, why else would an ATF man be after him? 'Albert Camus - A Life'
