Mark Halperin and John Heilemann are here. They are the co-creators and executive producers of the Showtime political docu-series, "The Circus: Inside the Biggest Political Show on Earth." The first season of the series documented the historic 2016 presidential election in real-time. Now, as the Trump presidency approaches the completion of its first 100 days, the program is back for a new season. And here is a look. 

And he hasn't done them for quite some time. And this has now become a point of controversy here. This group has been putting up these billboards. The billboards say, have you seen him? MissingDavidPerdue.com. Paid for by the Georgia Alliance for Social Justice. And Perdue has kind of dug in on this. He's like, I'm not going to meet with these people. So, we're interested in what happens in a deep red state like Georgia, maybe trending a little purple, but mostly red state like Georgia where a pretty popular sitting US senator comes back home to be greeted to this wave of progressive activism that's sweeping across the country. Why are you all here today? 

Because David Perdue won't talk to us. He's voted with Trump almost 100 percent of the time. He will not even meet with his constituents. We begged him to meet with us. 

What does that say to you that he won't come out and meet with you? 

It says that he's got his agenda and he doesn't want to hear ours. 

He's great at taking big money stuff, but he doesn't listen to us regular folks. 

Perdue said that's not his style. What is his style? He owes his constituents a town hall! 

Senator Perdue, you talked about a representative democracy and it's important to listen. But sources tell us that your camp encouraged your supporters to buy tables, so that you would face a friendly, not a hostile crowd. 

Every week in our office here in Atlanta, we have people who really don't agree with us, come in and give us their input. We're doing a good job of listening. 

Alliance for Social Justice says you didn't meet in a town hall. 

I do better than that. I'm meeting with individual constituents. Town hall is one way to do it. 

What do you hear from your constituents they are most encouraged about for the Trump administration, and what are they most concerned about? 

They are most encouraged that there's hope, that there is going to be rollback to some of the regulations that have hurt businesses, and that we will get to a tax solution, and that healthcare can get fixed. I hear that from my constituents every day. So, I think the concern is, they don't know him yet, not a lot about what he has done has gotten out through the media candidly. And so, they are a little still nervous about what he's going to do with foreign policy and what's he going to do with the economic situation. That's what I hear. 

The Circus airs on Showtime Sundays at 8 p.m. I'm pleased to have Mark Halperin and John Heilemann back at this table. Welcome, congratulations. 

Thank you, sir. 

Thanks, sir. 

Explain that segment. What just obviously shows that some people in the Congress on the Republican side are getting big pushback from their constituents having to do with healthcare specifically, budget items. 

So, we are -- it's just a scene from the upcoming episode on Sunday. We've been out this week in the country. It's the congressional recess, the first week, as you know. Congress people going home. And so, one of the features of the Trump presidency so far has been this wave of Democratic activism, where the left is suddenly as on fire as the right was back at the beginning of Barack Obama's administration. And they're showing up as these Congress people come home. They are taking over town hall meetings. They are trying to force town hall meetings. David Perdue, this senator from Georgia, has been ducking town hall meetings. And so, now, every time he goes home, he is greeted to several hundred people who are protesting at all of his events. And that's sort of one of the big things happening right now in our politics. 

How long a lead time do you need for this show? 

We shoot it in a way we don't think anything has ever been done, about politics at least, we shoot it from Sunday to Saturday and put it on the air the next day. 

OK, so, this is going to be on air Sunday night. This week has been full of Donald Trump and foreign policy. Now, I haven't seen the entire show, but that is the story here. The story that you just showed was a story about healthcare when it was being debated. They've already had the vote on healthcare. 

This is one of the most interesting weeks in what has been a non-stop news presidency. 

Exactly. 

You could argue that more news has been made this week on foreign policy than since Donald Trump became president. Russia, China, North Korea, Syria obviously. And yet, because Congress is away, you don't have the echo chamber of that co-equal branch of members of Congress in Washington in front of thousands of journalists and TV cameras responding. So, it has dominated the week to be sure. But imagine, if Congress hadn't been on recess, what the reaction, what the hot house reaction would be to all of these developments. And what John's segment there showed you, as we've seen as we've been with members of both parties around the country, is the country is not all caught up in this foreign policy stuff. The country is concerned about a lot of domestic issues, which was, to a large extent, the story of the campaign. Healthcare, taxes, business regulation, jobs, and so -- 

I understand that, but I mean, what's happening is this, the foreign policy stuff in terms of changing positions. 

Extraordinarily momentous -- 

You haven't seen the whole episode, Charlie. 

One of the premises of this episode, when we started planning it last weekend, was, what is this week going to be about? The Syria bombings had occurred in the previous week, but what is this week going to be about? It wasn't really clear what the dominant story would be. There is no doubt that for elites, this week has been about Russia, China, some of the things Donald Trump switched positions on. Out in the country - 

I want to make one small argument about that. I think everybody in the country saw the pictures that Donald Trump saw. 

Oh, 100 percent. 

That's last week for them. 

And they cared about that. 

They did. 

But for instance, there is some polling that will be out tomorrow that suggests that Donald Trump's approval rating did not change one whit based on his actions in Syria. 

And, Charlie, to your point, here is the thing. This show is always -- we are always in the week that we are in, right? So, last week, we did an episode that was about North Korea, China, Syria, Russia. It was a packed week. The China summit -- it was a packed week for foreign policy. This week, we'll have some of that in the episode this week. But we also have -- the fact is 535 members of Congress are not in Washington this week. They are out in the country. And I can tell you from being -- 

And this will be a time that they hear back from their constituents in terms of what's on their minds. 

I can tell you, being in Georgia and Virginia and Maryland over the course of the last three days with members of Congress and senators, people are talking a little bit about foreign policy, but they really are talking about a lot of other stuff. 

But that's always been true. People have always talked about what affects me, what affects my family, what affects my home, affects my job, and what affects my capacity. 

What's different, though, is that Donald Trump is now the president. And, whereas previously, where you saw this activism going on, which was mostly the Tea Party, right? Eight years ago, the Tea Party changed our politics because they were energized by the presence of Barack Obama. You now are seeing like the mirror image of that right now, which is the left wing version of the Tea Party rising up and showing up at these Republican town halls and flexing their muscles, now creating a situation where -- I had Elijah Cummings today, Congressman from Maryland, say to me he is a 100 percent confident that Democrats are going to retake control of the House of Representatives next year on the basis of what he is seeing, not just in his district, but around the country. We saw this race in Utah yesterday where -- a congressional district that Donald Trump won by 27 points three months ago, the Republican won by only 7 points yesterday. 

Because Donald Trump had to weigh in heavily with a lot of phone calls and everything else. 

So, this is a big story going on that's not just about this week, but about what's going on in the next year-and-a-half. 

Let's speak about, because it's a political story and you guys are good at that. What's the -- do you agree with what the congressman said in terms of the possibility of a coalescing of a resistance and a political movement against Donald Trump. 

It's way too soon to say that things are headed in that direction. Donald Trump has not been in office 100 days. There is no doubt that the Republican Party is still trying to find out -- figure out what it means to be the Republican Party of Donald Trump as a governing party and as a party facing a lot of elections in 2018. The Democratic Party is energized more by Donald Trump than they were by Ronald Reagan or George Bush. 

And is it primarily, is it more to the left? Is it the left that's more energized than anyone and is the left going to have more power and influence in the Democratic Party? 

Maybe. They'll have a lot of influence in the party. 

Because they were disappointed. 

They were, but the tale will be told, to a large extent, I think, by whether Donald Trump gets anything done or not. And right now, part of why this week is so fascinating is, everybody is focusing -- the White House is very focused on this foreign policy stuff, incredibly important. People out in the country are focused on things that affect them directly. He still hasn't proven he can master the legislative process. He's going to get through his first 100 days without passing a major piece of legislation. And the question, I think, is how does the alchemy of all this work. So, for one example, as I said before, no indication in any polling data we've seen that his big bold moves on foreign policy have affected how people think of him. And generally, presidents, when they do big bold things on foreign policy, would like to see a rise in their approval rating and then be able to use that as a leverage to go to Congress and say, I'm popular now, you need to work with me. 

A better example, George Bush, HOW Bush, president 41 had an 80 percent rating after -- 

Close to 90 percent. 

Close to 90 percent after the war. 

And his son was in the 70s and 80s after 9/11. 

And yet at the time, the economic issues prevailed because of Bill Clinton's ability to articulate. 

Here is what's also, I think, is important to what's going on this week. You think about -- the Congress is on a recess. The point you're making, Charlie, I think is not just about foreign policy, though. It's about something else that Donald Trump is trying to do right now, which is do a reset, while the Congress is on recess. And the reset isn't just about foreign policy. It's about the fact that he's changed his positions on a wide array of issues just in the last 48 hours. There is a big discussion now going on, especially with those changes on things like the Exim Bank and on whether China is a currency manipulator or not, on NATO, whether those are reflective -- 

Janet Yellen should be head of the Fed. 

All four things, he changed his mind to a position that most people, certainly elites, but also moderates like. 

Right, all reflective of a president who seems to be -- again, you can never tell what Trump fully -- you can't just read anything in 24 hours, but seems to be a president trying to be more conventional and more establishment. And then, at the backdrop against all of that is the Steve Bannon story. And I raise that story mainly because -- it's not about White House palace intrigue, although I'm fascinated by it. But, again, today, with Congressman Cummings, African-American Congressman, represents a largely African-American district, I said, do your constituents know who Steve Bannon is? He said, oh, they all know who Steve Bannon is. 

Is that right? 

I said, really? He said, yes, African-Americans are terrified of Donald Trump and part of the reason is because they see a white supremacist in the White House. And so, they know who Steve Bannon is for that reason. And, again, I raise that issue not to attack Steve Bannon, but to say that people are paying attention very closely. And that's why this pivot that Trump seems to be trying to do or this reset he's trying to do, why it matters. Is he moving away from Steve Bannon? Cummings said to me, he said, well, if he is doing that, that's good, that will be good. I'm encouraged by that because it signifies that maybe he's trying to become a more normal president than what we've seen so far. Less negative, more normal. 

Understanding how the congressman felt, my first instinct would be that Trump's voters didn't care about intrigue within Washington and didn't care about who was -- what advisor the president was favoring or the other one. But it cuts a certain way when they feel like someone is a white supremacist. 

There is a question about what the alt-right is, what his base -- Bannon is a hero for a lot of people on the right, just as he is a villain for a lot of people on the left. Are people who love Breitbart, are people who are that part of the Trump base, if Bannon were to lose his job, would they see that as significant? I don't know the answer to that, but it's not inconceivable that it will have the same kind of effect on those people who feel as though Bannon is a keeper of the populist flame in the White House. 

One of the things we've learned in traveling around the country doing "The Circus" is people on the right and even on the left are more patient than elites are about giving Donald Trump a little bit more time to see if he can figure this out. Can he work with Democrats? Can he can pass things? Can he live up to some of the promises he made? Elites want to scorecard it every day and say, it's over, he's not going to have anything done in the first 100 days, he's dead and buried politically. The people in the country are more patient. The people in the White House are growing impatient. They will say publicly the media is judging us too quickly, give us a little bit more time. But they recognize that they need to come back from this congressional recess. They've got the states - themselves in Washington now, but in a week-and-a-half, Congress will be back. And at that point, they are going to have to start getting things done with not quite a binary choice, but pretty close to it. They continue to try to pass things with Republican-only votes -- healthcare, taxes -- or do they switch and say, we're going to figure out a way to alienate some people on the right, but try and find a way to get some support from Democrats. 

Will Steve Bannon survive or is it in his hands to do something that will make sure that he survives? 

I think that if he learns to play nicely with others, he's got a chance to survive. He still adds value from the president's point of view. And Donald Trump on personnel is pretty simple. It's not about loyalty, although he can be a loyal person. But on personnel, it's, is the problems that the person causes worth it because I see a lot of upside? I think Steve Bannon needs to remind the president if he wants to stay, what's the upside of having Steve Bannon there because there is now clearly a big downside both from a PR point of view and from his inability to get along with others in the White House. 

I really don't understand this and I want to ask both of you this. On the one hand, there are all the people who had economic dislocation, people who suffered income inequality, who really have not seen the kind of improvement in their life and their lifestyle that they had hoped. Cases in which children are not as well off as their parents. That's one thing. There is the other thing which is part of what -- a part of which has an appeal that's nastier than that. It is the far right in American politics. Does Steve Bannon speak to both of them or is it just the people who are great readers of Breitbart? 

I don't have enough of an understanding of him to say what his intentions are. From the point of view of who responds to the rhetoric of Breitbart and the rhetoric of Bannon, it's both for sure. 

Is it both? 

It's both for sure in terms of who responds to it. 

Witness the fact they won. 

Witness the fact they won, but constant need in political journalism to not overinterpret things that happened. Donald Trump won because the country did not, I think, most primarily because the country did not see Hillary Clinton as someone who would change things. And they fundamentally wanted things to change. 

Someone said to me just this week, in the end -- regardless of what they thought about Hillary Clinton, in the end, this election was about change, which it often is. They wanted change. 

Do people care in the country who voted for Donald Trump that he opposed the Exim Bank? I don't think so. But did they care that he said China was a currency manipulator and he'd put a stop to that? I think a lot of people cared about that. 

Well, do they care, if in fact they believe he's going to do something about the fact that they think China, because of its practices, was taking jobs away from them. 

I think that's a pretty big deal for voters. 

That's why that was the first thing he said. 

But it's not even one of the individual things. I think you've got to -- over the last 25 years in our politics, you've seen the market for populist politics on the right and on the left has grown. It had been true, but it's true on the left. In this campaign, Bernie Sanders -- Bernie sanders made villains out of fat cats, the rich, Wall Street. But Donald Trump made -- 

Same people that Donald Trump appointed. 

Donald Trump picked another set of villains. But there are a bunch of people, some of whom are in the second category you mentioned. People who are -- who you can appeal to through racial animus and other things, but many of whom are just -- 

No, no, I was actually thinking about there are lot of billionaires and Wall Street types -- 

No, no, no, but I made the point, though, that I think that the market for grievance of whether you're on the left and your grievance is toward the rich, or whether you're on the right and your grievance is towards China or toward illegal immigrants or towards the Washington elites, the market for grievance and appealing to grievance has gotten larger. And part of what Bannon has done is he's tapped into the right -- the rightward wellspring of that grievance. That's what he has represented. In addition to, in some cases, Breitbart running things that have been anti-Semitic and racist, he also has this broader thing. 

He clearly does. I believe that beyond all of that and Breitbart and whatever may have been said on Breitbart, there is -- this is a guy who reads a lot and he's thought about history and cycles and all of that. 

Populism and nationalism, there is a market for those things. There just is. 

The system is perceived to be rigged against working class people, and it is. And so, people who say that and enunciate that, even if they're not specific about remedy, even if other aspects of their message that are less connected to economics, that is a reality of a lot of people in America today. And it's a reality -- 85 days into Donald Trump's presidency that -- again, you go to these town halls now, you hear a lot of grievance. And you hear a lot of people who, whether they are targeting their member of Congress or not, they feel the system is rigged. 

Well, and to go to your point from earlier, again, something I heard over the course of the last few days and I've heard it before, but now we're into Donald Trump's presidency, people are more patient than elites are. And I heard a lot of buzz with a bunch of veterans yesterday at the VFW Hall in Roanoke, Virginia. They are all ready to give Donald Trump a year. They're not ready to pull out -- a lot of Trump supporters in the room -- they are not ready to give up on him now. But it's only a year they're willing to give him. Their attitude is, I'll give him more time than you guys in the smart set in Washington, but I'm not going to give him four years. That's why the question is, what will he actually do as opposed to what he actually is just saying. 

During the campaign, think about all the candidates you watched, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and all those, where you do put, as a political animal, Donald Trump? 

I said after he won the nomination, he was the second best. Not because of -- 

Second to Bill Clinton. 

Not based on pure talent, but based on results. Because he won the nomination with about four advisors. Tiny little operations. Spent almost no money. 

When he says he was the principal strategist, I believe him. 

Without a doubt. That feat of winning the nomination, I thought, unmatched really in American history, given his bio, given the nature of the Republican Party that he wasn't a member of the year before he ran. 

And given the fact that he has spoken about every issue, often against what Republicans like in his life. 

And then like Donald Trump, I'm willing to accept new data and then change my position. I think his performance in the general electio
