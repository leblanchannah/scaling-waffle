Good evening everybody. I'm John Hockenberry filling in for Charlie Rose. We begin this evening with a look at President Trump's meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It was their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office. In the past, Trump has been critical of Merkel's leadership. He has said that Germany has made a catastrophic mistake in welcoming more than a million migrants and refugees in recent years. During today's summit, Trump expressed his strong support for NATO, but emphasized that member nations must pay what they owe to support the alliance. Mark Landler of "The New York Times" joins me now from Washington. Welcome. 

Good to be here, John. 

So, Mark, would you say that this is a test of the relationship between Merkel and Trump? It seems to me, always, when I look at the body language of Angela Merkel that, she, from the beginning, has not known what to make of this man. Is that settling down? Is there more of a clarity here? 

Well, I think, John, that Angela Merkel is someone who is used to dealing with mercurial sort of testosterone-style men if you will. She's dealt with Vladimir Putin in Russia, Berlusconi in Italy, Xi Jinping in China, Erdogan in Turkey, and now she's dealing with Donald Trump in the United States. The U.S. is such a major trading partner and ally of the U.S. that Merkel has to figure out how to work with the new American President. And I think that's what you saw today. Whatever she may make of him -- and it would be wonderful to know what her inside thoughts or interior thoughts are -- she was going to make this relationship work. She came to Washington to try to find some common ground, and I think the news conference they held together was an illustration of two people who are literally poles apart on some of these crucial issues, but at least from her perspective, trying very hard to find a way to work together. 

I got the sense that she expressed subtly, if you will, to Donald Trump that she'll take care of this part of the relationship and he can take care of this part of the relationship. That she kind of set out domains that she thought Germany was going to be better to handle and that other aspects of the migrant crisis that Trump could deal with on his own, and that that would build into a kind of bifurcated relationship that might function very well. 

Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, I think what she made a point of saying is that she is the leader of Germany, will look after German national interest. She described her response to the migrant crisis that's obviously very different than what President Trump is talking about, but one that she thinks is suited to German interests. And likewise on trade, which is the other major bone of contention between the two of them. She said, look, I'm also here to lobby for and push German interests, and she turned to him at one point and said, A trade deal is only worth doing if both sides win. So I think you're right. She was saying I will play my corner of the court and you play yours, and that way we'll be able to coexist, and perhaps even work together. 

Since before the end of the Cold War, and Merkel was a leader early on in understanding how these forces work, demographics have been a real warning sign in Germany that the workforce needs to grow, it needs to grow somehow. The birthrate needs to rise, it isn't rising. Part of the impetus for migrants to come into Germany is to add to the workforce. It's not an argument that Donald Trump really has much context with. He doesn't think about immigration in those terms. Is it possible that Merkel expressed to him, look, here's another way of looking at it, and a lot of these nations really need to think about bring workers in because it's helpful for them for the precise reasons that we want trade to work. 

Well, you know, people always say that Donald Trump is surprisingly receptive to the arguments of people he meets. That said, I mean, the United States, as you say, is blessed with very different demographics than Germany or other western European countries. It's got a younger population, more young people. So that argument simply isn't particularly applicable to the United States. We have other very valid reasons and historical reasons for being open to immigrants. But replenishing the workforce and creating new younger citizens is not one of them. So I don't actually think that that argument probably makes much of an influence on him. I wonder whether it's more on the trade side, where today the two talked about German companies and the role in apprenticing and training young workers. That might be an area where Chancellor Merkel can actually present Donald Trump some ideas that will make an impact. And that's actually the subject that they discussed after the news conference when they went back into the White House for lunch. 

What do you think the urgency is for Angela Merkel to figure out exactly what Donald Trump's relationship or intentions are with Vladimir Putin right now? 

Well Angela Merkel has always been the leader in the West who has kind of served as the bridge to Vladimir Putin. She understands him perhaps better than any other leader in the West. She's certainly met him more perhaps than any other leader in the West, and so I think it's vitally important for her to figure out what kind of relationship Donald Trump is seeking. And that's not an easy question to answer in the current environment, because while President Trump came into office calling for a new kind of relationship and a reset with Russia, in recent days, and I think it's, in part, because of the continuing questions around the Trump campaign's ties to the Russians during the election, you've seen the administration actually stake out a much more traditional position. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, was quoted as saying we can never trust Russia. So we're in a bit of a fluid moment where you had a president who wanted to change the relationship but perhaps is finding out he has very little room to maneuver to do that, and may, indeed, end up with a relationship that's much closer to the one the Obama Administration had and hence to what chancellor Merkel herself would be comfortable with. 

And would Chancellor Merkel be in a position to say, look, bear down on this if you like, but this isn't going to fly, these things, this never trust Russia. And we have a problem in Ukraine and we need to decide together how we're going to deal with it. That's the priority. 

Yeah, I think probably what she'll really try to do is say, look, I know Vladimir Putin better than anyone. I've been working this issue now for years. The whole Minsk process, this diplomatic process to try to resolve the situation in Ukraine is something the Germans have really spearheaded. And, you know, the American administration said last week to reporters, in advance of this meeting, that Donald Trump would be interested and curious about Chancellor Merkel's take on Vladimir Putin. Remember, for all his talk about Putin, he doesn't actually know Putin at all. So I think he's probably going to ask her, quiz her a little bit about how best to deal with the Russian leader. And perhaps, as I said earlier, she could make an impact on him. He has a penchant for listening to people and taking some of their ideas to heart when they make a persuasive case. 

Did you get any sense of the friendliness of them, the ways in which -- I mean it's so different to see how they address the reporters at a meeting like this? 

Well, to be honest, I thought it was, as I have thought to myself, sort of meticulously formal, very impersonal. There was no chemistry that I could really detect. But to be fair, Chancellor Merkel is a brainy intellectual. She's not a warm person. Even President Obama, with whom she had arguably the best relationship that President Obama had with a foreign leader, there wasn't a whole lot of sentimentality of, you know, putting their arms around each other. She's not like that. You'll remember that famous episode years and years ago where President Bush put his hands on her shoulders, and she sort of recoiled. She's a low-key, very intellectual person, and so I wouldn't have expected to see sort of a very emotional display. That said, these are really two people who have very little in common and are really poles apart on many issues, and that distance came through today in the news conference. 

So no touchy feely. Finally in the last minutes -- 

Far from it. 

-- what about the notions of nationalism building in Europe and some evidence that such nationalist sentiments are building in the United States, what would she want to say to Donald Trump about that? 

Well, you know, she's gotten a bit of good news on that front recently. The far right Populist Party in The Netherlands did not do as well as some thought it would earlier in the week in the election. She's got her own far right party in Germany that, months ago, many in Germany were very worried about. But in recent months, there's also evidence that that party has declined in popularity. And you're beginning to hear a little bit more about what they're calling a sort of a Trump backlash, that some of these far right populist movements in some European countries appear to be running out of steam. So I think that she probably feels better about that issue than she might have last November in the wake of Donald Trump's election. 

Mark Landler, thank you so much. 

Great to be here, John. 

Good evening. I'm Ethan Bronner filling in for Charlie Rose. Venezuela, with more proven oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, was once one of the richest countries, not only in Latin America, but in the world. Governed for the past two decades by the socialist Chavista Party and ravaged by corruption and inefficiency, it is now on the verge of collapse, with spreading hunger, rampant violent crime, and triple digit inflation. How bad will it get, is there a solution, and how should the Trump Administration react? Joining me here in New York is Chris Sabatini. He's the executive director of Global Americans and a professor of Latin American Studies at Columbia University. And from Philadelphia is Michael McCarthy. He's a research fellow at American University's Center for Latin American Studies. I'm pleased to welcome them to the program. So, Chris, you're here in the studio with me. I'll start with you. Just speak for a minute or two about how it got so bad given, you know, all the wealth and talent that Venezuela was famous for at one time. 

Well, it was a confluence of issues. First of all, in 1998 when Hugo ChÃ¡vez was elected, it was really the two-party system that had dominated Venezuela for almost 30 years had basically imploded and you had an outsider candidate, a lieutenant colonel who had staged a coup earlier who really came to power promising to clean up the system, and he did, in the sense of he just completely did away with the old system and but in doing so, he also doubled down on Venezuela's oil wealth, which, as you say, is considerable. And over the course of his patronage-driven, very socialist-oriented economy, he basically consolidated the economy around oil. Today 96 percent of Venezuela's exports are based on oil. That was fine when oil was priced at $120 a barrel, but today it's around $40 a barrel, and the country is hurting. 

And beyond that, there are questions of institutions able to withstand the kind of corruption that came in with all of this, right? 

Well, he broke down the barriers between the then semi-state owned oil company, PDVSA, and the government and basically raided its coffers, which also meant that he didn't invest in infrastructure and development, so production has been declining. The central bank has been raided, but as well, he's basically sort of corrupted and undermined and vitiated democratic institutions. The Supreme Court is firmly under his control. The electoral commission is firmly under his control. 

And the congress, which isn't, has no power. 

Has no power. It's been stripped, virtually, of power. 

Michael, a little less than a year ago, you wrote, I think in "The Washington Post," that Venezuela is a powder keg, and you said that there's wide-spread social disorder and triggering instability throughout the continent. Now, I mean, I'm not saying it was sort of a reasonable thing to say, but is that right? Is that still true, or has something shifted and why? 

Great question, Ethan. I think that it's accurate to say that in 2016, the biggest fear those of us who follow Venezuelan politics had was that the possibility of the country exploding in terms of social unrest. And there were, in fact, a number of episodes of instability on a sort of city-wide basis. However, the government hunkered down, deployed the armed forces to repress these protests as much as possible, and it managed to hold onto power. And at the end of 2016, when the opposition managed to mobilize millions of the population on behalf of a recall referendum, the government then blocked that effort, which then set the stage for what people thought was going to be a clash in the last couple of months of 2016. But lo and behold, an international supported dialogue process began immediately, and that cooled the street down and basically de-escalated the situation as 2016 came to an end. And I would describe the Venezuelan population today as basically in a state of depression. They moved through sort of the stages of grief with regards to the death of the recall referendum from mourning to anger to bargaining, and now I think we're in a situation of pretty much depression, where there doesn't feel like there's a sense of possibility or hope about political change. And that helps explain why the beginning of 2017 has been quite a bit calmer on the streets of Venezuela, despite the fact that the country is experiencing a recession marked by hyperinflation -- pardon me, I should say depression, marked by hyperinflation and severe shortages. 

So, I mean, but the thing is that this dialogue that you mentioned, as you say calmed things down, was very much promoted by the United States Government under President Obama. I think the dialogue has essentially collapsed. But I'd be eager to hear from both of you whether you think the dialogue was the right policy. 

First I want to compliment Michael on what he said. It is powder keg. He's absolutely right. It may seem depressed right now, but what has happened in Venezuela, as I mentioned earlier, is this disarticulation of the very institutions and rules that could have mediated and provided some sort of exits. So you've got a hyperpolarized situation, you've got families -- 90 percent of the families are food insecure, are not getting enough, who don't have medicines coming in, people are waiting in long lines. There is a boiling caldron of discontent, and the institutions are simply not there to mediate it. And the government has basically postponed what would have been a constitutional referendum or recall referendum and even elections for the governors. So you really don't have any exits, and the hope was there could be a dialogue. The problem was both the United States, and then later the Vatican, intervened, and also the Union of South American Republics, a South American multilateral organization, tried to foster a dialogue. But there was no rules to the dialogue. They were basically -- they were holding the government unaccountable for the basic rules and rights that it was violating. There were over a hundred political prisoners in Venezuela, and they're not being released or even on the table for discussion. 

So before I get to the dialogue, let me go back to something you said. So Michael said a year ago -- he said it was a powder keg and now he's saying they're in a state of depression. You're saying, no, it is a powder keg. It seems to me there's a difference between whether the place is about to blow or whether the place is just too depressed to do anything. Is it your sense that the streets could explode in Venezuela? 

I still think they could. I think people -- but the problem is, is the situation economically and socially has become so dire that people are pursuing basic human needs and people are basically scrounging in garbage to get food. People are starving. Poverty is at 80 percent. They're pursuing those sort of basic survival needs right now. But that does not mean that there is not deep-seated discontent. 

Of course. 

And a level of repression and obstreperousness from the government that it will, should they begin to protest and take to the streets, I simply don't know where it will go. 

Okay. And, again, before we get to the dialogue, so back to you, Michael, on this question, do you have the sense, actually, when you spoke of moving from powder keg to depression, the impression you gave me was, you know, it's not about to explode. Do you feel it is? Did I misunderstand you? 

No, I think your analysis of my review of 2016 is correct, Ethan. I think at this point the Venezuelan opposition's leadership has a gigantic challenge in front of it, which is to somehow get over the sense of demoralization that exists in the Venezuelan population right now and create a sense of belief again. 

It brings me to asking you whether the dialogue approach was a problematic one from your perspective. 

So, I think that there needs to be some nuancing in terms of how we understand the dialogue's negative effects in country in terms of taking away the opposition's main resource at that time in October and November, which was street mobilization. And that is to say that the opposition accepted a request from the Vatican to not lead a march that was going to culminate in a rally in downtown Caracas. And the Vatican had made that request because it seemed likely that such a rally would result in violence. 

Okay. 

And the opposition basically took a step back. And one could argue that it was a mistake to call off the march completely. But you could also understand why the Vatican made that request, since it's sine qua non for participating in this is that there be some type of peace in the country in terms of the political conflict. But the problem is, is that the Vatican wasn't able to deliver, and at this point, they have somewhat disengaged from the process. And there is a real problem, because in country it's a problem of fire power in Venezuela, and so how do you create a new equilibrium in which the opposition can, in some way, match force with the government? It's going to be very, very difficult. The Trump administration has used the Kingpin authority to make a special designation about the vice president of the country, an unappointed official, that he is a narco-trafficker. That is significant, because it means that should the Maduro government look to make an internal transition, the current vice president would not be viable as the substitute, because how would he travel, right? The other countries would not be able to really recognize this government the same way. So this has been the first attempt by the Trump Administration so far to send a new message. And it's quite clear that the dialogue has basically been put on hold for now. But I think we need to think about talks as a multi-shot game, that is to say it's not just one and done, right? 

Right. 

It's about creating new conditions for a future round. 

Okay. So in the future round you think that the organization for American states might be involved, Chris? 

Currently the secretary general, Luis Almagro, issued a very good report, a 75-page report condemning all of the different abuses. And even the past efforts of dialogue, and saying the government was not held accountable. And as Michael was saying, by engaging in those talks, it basically stripped out the opposition's ability to exercise its fundamental rights, which has really left it somewhat defanged. But I just don't see the Venezuelan government accepting the OES, because the OES has been very outspoken. They've called the secretary general -- or the president has called him trash. It's not a good way to initiate or accept dialogue from that. And dialogue is really, as Michael said, it's not a one and done. This has to be repetitive process. The issue is it has to be done in a way that holds the government accountable. Because right now the government is betting that it can sort of hold the line until next presidential elections in 2018, and at that time, hopefully the price of oil will have gone back up and they can engage in a new round of patronage. 

And do you agree with Michael that this move to name the vice president a drug kingpin by the United States government is an act, in effect, by this administration to say something, to lay a line, because Obama also did the same with the guy who became the interior justice minister as well, and, you know, you do also have the feeling the naming of this man as vice president was also a political act by Maduro, by the President. 

Yeah, this man really is bad news. 

Yeah. He is really one of the most thuggish individuals in power anywhere, right? 

Precisely. He organized for the national policemen. He was head of Aragua governorship, crime spiked. There are very good evidence that he's been involved. You know, the questions are two-fold. One, was this a wise move to spur the dialogue? Some people say no. I think there's another question, and it's a gamble, is that maybe by naming him it will send a message to others within the regime that if you don't sort of start to get in line in the dialogue process, you, too, may lose your privileges to travel to the United States and have bank accounts and yachts and all of your other properties and the goodies in the U.S. that you like to have. 

I imagine those guys aren't moving to the United States very quickly anyway, right? 

Probably not any time soon. But losing those privileges. So I think it's a double-edged sword. It could cut either way. But clearly this government, its immediate reaction was sort of a, you know, basically thumbing its nose at the United States, saying, you know, tough luck. 

Do you guys have the sense that Maduro, as President, will, in fact, allow an election when the electoral calendar turns up? 

I'm not so sure. He basically -- there was a recall referendum that the opposition had demanded that was constitutionally -- and basically they kicked the can down the road, and there was supposed to be gubernatorial and local elections held in December. 

Which they also -- 

They postponed those indefinitely. You know, I think this is a government that realized if it's going to lose an election -- and Maduro's popularity is about 18 percent right now -- they're more than willing to postpone elections. So I think that's the risk, is the dialogue has to get people to elections. But it has to do it under the conditions that elections are free and fair and credible for the opposition to participate. 

This is the thing that the international community has to make sure happens. If there's one thing that we have to ensure in Venezuela is that there's a presidential election within 2018, that we have a clear date for it, with some sort of international guarantee that it takes place. I agree with Chris that it's going to be very difficult. From the government's perspective, the country is in a state of exception. That has been their argument, which is their between-the-lines way of saying, we are in a crisis. They won't say it publicly, but that's what they're really saying when you look at some the rulings by the Supreme Court, for example. And I think that that is the pretext that they're going to try and use to move the date back for those presidential elections for 2019. 

Do you think that the Obama Administration's desire to improve its relations with Cuba and take Cuba out of the freezer the way it's been, caused to have a shortsighted view of what to do in Venezuela? 

I think there's two answers to that question, Ethan. First is, part of the issue is not applying sanctions was, in part, driven by the State Department and a career foreign service officer in the State Department who really wanted to pursue dialogue, who had serious doubts about the opposition. It wasn't just an Obama Administration policy. And I think the Obama Administration made the calculation that Cuba was a lesser national security threat than Venezuela was so went through Cuba. Now did that mean that they trimmed their sales a little bit on being more aggressive on Venezuela? That's possibly true. But I don't think they were linked as directly as one would think. 

Michael, on that? 

Yeah, I mean, I generally agree with Chris there, I mean, I don't think that there's much of a cost to sort of sanctioning Venezuela. There really isn't much of a cost for hitting the country in that regard. It doesn't have even any support for example -- the Chavista Project doesn't have any support internationally, really. Democrats in congress are no longer willing to listen. Liberal democrats are no longer willing to listen to the Maduro government's claims. You have a bipartisan consensus there about the importance of sanctions for standing up for universal human rights. So I think that, although there was that close sequencing, right, December 17th, Obama announced his normalization. December 17th, 2014, he announced his normalization talks with Cuba, and the day after, he signs a bill from Congress, which ultimately resulted in the sanctions in 2015. So there is a connection there. And the point is, is that Venezuela, for the moment, is something where we're trying to really rally the troops. But there still isn't a consensus about what to do, right? No one is really talking about the real value of the most aggressive action, which would be sanctioning Venezuela's oil exports, right? 

Right. 

As you mentioned in the run-up, that would really hit the government where it hurts. But that seems unlikely because of the precedent it would set. We're not talking about a crisis that threatens vital U.S. national security interests, right? So it's a very difficult crisis to manage, and we don't really have that many great options. So the real point here is to argue that there are great costs for disengaging, right? We've made significant progress in ratcheting up pressure, but there still remains a great amount of work to figure out a solution for this highly complicated problem. 

That's a great way to end it, I think. So I want to thank both of our guests tonight, and we'll be back in a minute. 

Good evening. I'm William Cohan filling in for Charlie Rose. Rebekah Mercer is the billionaire heiress who not only provided pivotal financial support for Donald Trump when his campaign was flailing last summer but suggested he hire Steve Bannon who worked at Breitbart News, the media organization part owned by the Mercer family and Kellyanne Conway, who had also worked for the Mercers, said to be hugely instrumental on the transition executive committee and responsible for several key appointments, many people have asked just who is this 43-year-old woman? Joining me now is Vicky Ward, an investigator reporter and correspondent for "The Huffington Post's Highline Magazine," who has spent four months reporting on a piece about Mercer that was published today. It is called the "Blow-it-all-up Billionaires." Welcome, Vicky Ward. This is an honor for me, a pleasure to have my former "Vanity Fair" colleague here at this table, as Charlie Rose would say. This is an incredible piece of journalism. 

Thank you. 

I can tell you spent a lot of time on it. Can you just tell us, start by telling us who are these people? Who are the Mercers, because they've suddenly appeared out of what seems like nowhere, and yet we should know more about them? 

What's really unusual about the Mercers, and particularly Rebekah Mercer, who, you know, has become the mouthpiece of her far more reclusive billionaire father. 

Who was a hedge fund manager. 

Right. Well, he's a former scientist. 

Turned hedge fund manager. 

Turned hedge fund manager. So only made his billions, you know, relatively late in life, in his 50s. So unlike most of the other mega political donors, Rebekah Mercer is essentially a housewife without a big business of her own to run, who is in a position to really, then, you know, get involved, in a detailed way, in the Trump campaign, in the details, then as we saw on the Trump transition team -- I mean, you didn't see any of the Trump donors sitting around. 

On the executive committee. 

Yes. In that kind of way. But what's really different about the Mercers is not only did they lobby very hard to have their preferred candidate and people they knew very well to, then, work with him, they actually want to blow up the system, the whole political system. They wanted to blow up the republican establishment. And the vehicle through which they wanted to do that was this, originally, British data science firm, SCL, that was renamed -- the American arm has been renamed Cambridge Analytica. And the reason that that's important is that the way the sort of political system works is that all these data science companies that are used in all political campaigns, in America, traditionally, are affiliated with either the Republican Party or the Democrats. What the Mercers did, particularly I think after they saw Mitt Romney's loss in 2012. And that was when Rebekah Mercer first got noticed. 

I mean, didn't they back some wacky congressman candidate who -- 

Yes. 

-- collecting urine to try to -- 

Yes, yes! 

-- to change people's longevity. 

Well, it all starts with Citizens United. 

Of course. 

That decision, of course. 

That's a very important point. There would literally be no Mercers -- 

Correct. 

-- as we know them today without Citizens United. Could you talk about that? 

Completely important, because -- and, in fact, in the piece I have, one person, David Magerman, on the record, who spoke out to "The Wall Street Journal" and then was suspended from Renaissance Technologies. 

Incredibly. For criticizing Robert Mercer. 

Right. For criticizing Robert Mercer. And, you know, he said that, you know, they were all slightly crazy at Renaissance Technologies. They're all slightly wacky anti-establishment people who all have crazy views. Robert Mercer really used to say quite publicly that, you know, he believed that people who earned very little money had very little value to society. So he was critical of teachers. Critical of teachers. 

I mean, that is astounding to me. 

It is. 

Just because they don't make enough money. 

They don't make enough money. You know, so he would say things like this, and inside the firm, but David Magerman said, "You know, we're all slightly crazy inside Renaissance Technologies." No one thought really that this mattered, that sort of Robert Mercer was the kind of person who preferred speaking to cats than to humans. So as long as he had spoke to his cats, all of this was fine. But then, when Citizens United, when that decision gets passed, of course -- 

Which allowed unlimited amount of money being spent for political campaigns. 

For individuals, I think -- 

That changed the whole political landscape. 

It changed the landscape. And the Mercers, their first test run I believe was in Oregon with this doctor, Arthur Robinson, who was affiliated with this organization, and very proudly so, that collected vials of urine, you know, to believe it could prolong life. And no one had heard of this man. But they saw that their money -- 

Could have an effect. 

-- really had an effect. And that changed everything. From there, they brought -- they invested in Breitbart, which is, of course, where they come across Steve Bannon. And Steve Bannon earns their trust, you know, Andrew Breitbart dies. Steve Bannon does a lot, I think, to rectify the health of -- the financial health of Breitbart, and expands its platform quite dramatically. 

And that impressed the Mercers. 

Yes. And also, I mean, what I get into in the piece, which I found very interesting, is that quite a few of the sort of republican consultants I talked to mentioned that Steve Bannon, until going into the White House, often appeared dressed like a homeless person. And, in fact -- 

He still kind of looks like he's dressed like a homeless person. 

Well he wears a suit and a tie. But, you know, the number of photographs we've seen of him in his track pants and sort of, you know, all disheveled. And one of Ted Cruz's political consultants said to me, it's actually a very brilliant strategy in this very strange kind of Rubik's Cube-like world of uncomfortable co-dependencies that makes up the political world, because if you're a political consultant, you want the donors who you're so reliant on to just focus on your brain, to what's inside your -- you know, on your strategy. You don't want them suddenly looking at your cufflinks or how you eat a bread roll or things like that. That can make a huge difference. They can abandon you because of things like that. So, like, turning up looking like a homeless person maybe, I think, obviously, worked extremely well for Steve Bannon. 

So let's step back a little bit. 

Yeah. 

Because I think Renaissance Technologies and Jamie Simons and Robert Mercer, this is a big hedge fund. Jamie Simons is usually the highest -- one of the highest paid, if not the highest paid, hedge fund manager year in and year out. Obviously Robert Mercer was his right-hand guy and made a lot of money himself. 

Right. 

Has a few toys, right? 

Right. 

A big yacht. There's a great scene in here about them going out to Fisher's Island, right? 

Yes. 

But Rebekah Mercer, who is his, what, 43-year-old daughter -- 

The middle daughter. 

The middle daughter, she -- just explain, because she's got this -- she not only worked at Renaissance for a few years. I'd like to know what she did there. 

Right. 

But she also has, like, a cookie company. So, and then as a side light, she's, like, trying to overthrow what we think of the Republican Party orthodoxy. 

Correct. 

So this is a very complex woman that you seem to have captured very well in this piece, I think. 

Right, so she did work two or three years, I believe, at Renaissance. I don't think on the trading desk. 

She has a Stanford degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Yes, but I'm not sure -- Again, I don't think David Magerman was actually one of her bosses. And put it this way, I don't think -- I mean, it ended not so well. 

Right. And perhaps a bit of nepotism got her there. 

Right. And she certainly, by the time 2010 Citizens United came and the Mercers were finding out what money could do for them in the political sphere, had enough time on her hands. I mean, I know she does home school her four children, but she had enough time on her hands to go all in. And she would attend these freedom summits that, you know, the Koch network, David Bossie. 

Who is another important player in this story. 

Yes. 

Because he was the head of Citizens United. 

Head of Citizens United. 

So there's a direct link, then, between Citizens United, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, Trump. 

Right. No, Dave Bossie is actually very important interconnecter in all of them. Dave Bossie, I believe, is the person who introduced -- the person who first introduced, at these summits, the Mercers to Donald Trump. He didn't know them very well. But over the years, I mean, that's how he got to know Steve Bannon. That's how he got to know Kellyanne Conway. It's also how he got to know the Mercers. They would all talk. But Rebekah Mercer, I think, found these summits frustrating, and she thought they were too soft on immigration and on trade. She also, you know, thought that no one paid enough attention to her. So -- and she -- 

Because is she an egomaniac? Does she need the attention? 

Well, put it this way, even people who would call themselves supporters and friends of hers call her "a force." 

A force. 

A force. 

Is that a euphemism for something? 

Well I think she's clearly a very assertive personality. And someone who would definitely consider themselves a friend of her's said, you know, she perhaps has low EQ, which means that, you know, obviously means she has low EQ, she doesn't read a room well. And what's she interested in is politics, is her agenda, and getting it across. And she first got herself really noticed after the Mitt Romney loss in 2012, when she stood up at the University Club in New York and berated the room for saying, you know, he had a terrible canvassing and data operation, you know, and sort of scolded them all, and everyone was sort of like, who is this woman? 

There's some great details in this story, and I just want to talk about some of those quickly. You can talk about them. You know, Bannon, Steve Bannon being in charge of Biosphere 2. 

Yes. 

I don't know whether it was the scientific experiment out in the desert. He changed the locks. They ended up breaking -- the scientists broke the seal on Biosphere 2 so they could get out, because Steve Bannon had essentially locked them in. I mean, and -- okay, go ahead talk about that. 

I mean, really, the point of bringing up Biosphere 2 was to show that Steve Bannon is -- 

Is a complicated guy. 

Well, he has a history of -- he's very good at coming in and taking -- he was brought into Biosphere 2 as a banker. 

Right. Formerly went to Goldman and his own firm? 

Yes. And he ended up running it. And he has an appeal to very rich people. He obviously has a charisma there. They end up trusting him. And Ed Bass, the billionaire who felt that this project was being completely mismanaged, I mean, brought him in to fix it. And I believe that when that -- yes, I mean, the other thing that is notable with Steve Bannon, there's always quite a lot of drama. So the way that the old regime had to be sort of removed and he could take over, did involve armed federal marshals. 

Nice. Thanks, Steve. 

So it's -- you know, I mean he is -- 

But he did sort of a similar thing with, you know, with getting out -- getting the Mercers and himself, Kellyanne Conway out of the Ted Cruz camp into the Donald Trump camp, at just the right moment, right, and taking over that campaign. Supposedly fixing that after the Paul Manafort, you know -- 

Well I think the thing that really struck the Cruz campaign about Steve Bannon -- and, you know, many of these people are obviously great personal friends -- was that -- and I think they wonder to this day if he had not realized until the spring of last year that Ted Cruz was born in Canada, because Steve Bannon was, you know, supposedly with the Mercers, and they had all agreed that Ted Cruz would be the candidate. But suddenly Breitbart wrote, I think, 61 articles mentioning the fact that Ted Cruz was no longer electable because he was born in Canada. And the Cruz campaign and Senator Cruz called and said -- you know, called the Mercers, said -- 

What are you doing? 

-- what's going on? And Rebekah Mercer said, "Oh, I have to be -- you know, I have to let Steve do his thing. I have to be fair and impartial." And it was also quite clear, I think, by then, that Steve Bannon had said to the Mercers, who then applied a lot of pressure to Ted Cruz, that they felt Ted Cruz wasn't close enough to Jeff Sessions' positions on trade and immigration, and he had to -- sort of was asked to move his policies closer to Jeff Sessions. They complained about a "Wall Street Journal" op-ed he'd co-authored with Paul Ryan, saying that he was pro-free trade. They complained about that. And Bannon was definitely sort of whispering in their ear on that one. And then when Trump, during the primaries, came out with his, you know, Muslim ban, Rebekah Mercer said to Ted Cruz, she'd give him these dressing downs after each debate, which I think the Cruz campaign found difficult to swallow -- 

You would think. 

-- because Senator Cruz was, after all, a debate champion from Princeton, I believe. So, but she told him that, you know, his positions on immigration were no -- you know, needed to move closer to Trump's, and, indeed, to the base. So he came out with this policy about H1B visas, and there would be a 90-day period where H1B visa holders, you know -- 

So Trump wins. 

Yeah. 

Success has many fathers. Everybody's claiming that they had a role and they were responsible for his victory. And on election night, she's hanging out with Breitbart. Again, great details. Breitbart in his office where there's a curtain, so no one can see. 

Bannon. 

Bannon -- excuse me -- where there's a curtain where no one can see what he's doing. But then she tries to get people she wants into the Administration. She's on the executive transition team. 

Right. 

And she tries to get the people she wants in the administration. She gets nixed -- no pun intended -- by and large. And she's sort of -- 

Well she got -- no, I mean, she won some. I mean she wanted Flynn. I mean -- okay -- 

Okay. She got Flynn. That's a big mistake. 

-- for a while. She got Jeff Sessions. She also was dead against Mitt Romney and -- 

And Mitt Romney's daughter. 

Well she was dead against Mitt Romney getting a position. Remember, he was being considered briefly -- 

He was. 

-- for Secretary of State. Yeah, she was furious when Mitt Romney's niece was made head of the RNC. And I think another huge disappointment, she tried twice for John Bolton, who's had a relationship with the Mercers. I mean, he's donated to their causes. They've donated to him. And, you know, John Bolton's foreign policy positions are, I believe, not in line with Donald Trump, so it makes no sense that he would be -- 

But she was upset about it. 

And she's very -- she is very, very, very vocal. But I think the thing that really upset her, and I have this scene in the piece where she goes to Lee Hanley's memorial service on December 19th. What she really wanted -- and this is the sort of, I think, kind of most worrying element of what the Mercers were trying to do, she really wanted to control one outside group, what's called the outside group, this group that -- an advocacy -- that advocates for the issues that gets the President's agenda out across the country. But she didn't just want to do that. Someone in the piece said she wanted to -- she got these people elected. She had got -- 

She believes she got them elected. 

So she now believes -- she wanted this group with her, you know, using Cambridge Analytica as the engine. And this is the most important part, she wanted to hold them accountable. So theoretically, theoretically, let's say Donald Trump, you know, hypothetically wanted to invade Grenada, she -- if she had got her way and her engine with their great database could message the country to follow her agenda and not the President's -- you know, that's power above the level -- 

Is she, like, thinking he's the Manchurian candidate and she's controlling the chip. 

That was the most terrifying part about this. 

I mean, this is terribly revealing about her and her agenda and her desire. 

That was the most terrifying part of this. And the history, if you look at the Mercers' history, shows -- you know, if you go back to the candidates that they backed right at the beginning when they were sort of testing things, the ends matter to them much more than the means. So this, I think, was the most sort of -- this was the most troubling aspect of all of it. She didn't get -- here she got stopped. And she got stopped because Alexander Nix has upset every single American who's come his way. 

In contact with him. 

In contact with him. And Brad Parscale, the very down to earth, Kansas-born, you know -- 

He designed websites for the Trumps and suddenly took over the whole digital strategy. 

He's completely loyal to -- yes, to the Trump family and to Jared Kushner. Really got sick and tired after the election of hearing from the Cambridge Analytica PR machine, how it was all them. When, in fact, he never used any of those psychographics. And the decision for Donald Trump to go to the Rust Belt, to go to Wisconsin, was actually -- it started when Brad Parscale had this light bulb moment. 

Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. 

Yeah. But it was actually a light bulb moment when Parscale suddenly thought, wait a minute, what if we have much lower voter turnout than everyone's been expecting. And he then asked two members of his team to run models based on voter turnout that was similar to the midterms, 2014, not as high as people had been thinking it would be. And that's when he saw the path. He mapped out a path that was actually 305 Electoral College votes, so he was one vote off. And he, then, took all this to Bannon, to Bossie, to Jared Kushner. 

He becomes one of the most important people that most people never even heard of. 

Right. And you know what, and he's like that way. So when he's, then, in a meeting in Trump Tower during the transition team with, you know, Rebekah Mercer and with, you know, all the other -- Kellyanne Conway -- I describe, you know, all the people in the room -- and she's pushing for this one organization, and she's going -- he basically -- 

Pushing for Nix. 

Yes. And he said, you know, very politely, "No." This is not about Mercer. This is about Trump. And no respect -- Cambridge -- and it's certainly not about Cambridge Analytica, who had nothing to do with why we got here. And that caused, you know -- that has caused a rift. We've now ended up with -- I mean, I think Rebekah Mercer will have her own group. But there are now going to be three different outside groups. And it dilutes the power of each, because donors will decide which group to go with. 

I get the sense, from the way you ended the piece, that we haven't heard the last of Rebekah Mercer. 

Oh, no. Oh, no. 

And it sounded also like Steve Bannon knows he's a short timer. He's, like, doing all of these things. I mean, that seemed to me news that you're breaking in this piece. Is that true? 

Well, someone very close to Steve Bannon phoned me this morning to tell me that he has definitely told friends that, you know, he like -- that the country comes first, and he likens himself to Thomas Cromwell, who, as we know, did end up beheaded. 

Head on a silver platter. 

And he's also aware that he's looked tired. But that this person said to me rather humorously, because we often see him on TV wearing makeup. Recently, we saw him at CPAC without wearing any makeup. So he looked much worse. 

So do you think Steve Bannon -- 

I think his priority is this list on the wall he has of all the things -- his agenda for the first hundred days. He cares about that. He cares about the country. If he somehow implodes in the process, that's fine. Country first. 

So we could be -- I mean, he seems to have recognized that his days -- he's only going to have a limited time on the stage. He wants to -- 

Well, listen, who knows what will really be. But we do know that Steve Bannon is a student of history, and people -- 

If you say so. 

Well, people in his position, you know -- 

Have a half-life. 

Yes. 

Have half-life. But the Mercers -- I mean, I think the whole fascinating thing, the Citizens United unleashed the Mercers, it unleashed a lot of powerful wealthy people. But this go-round this election cycle, it seems like it unleashed the Mercers on us, and this is really one of the first times that we're actually able to have an understanding of who they are, how they worked throughout this campaign, first backing Ted Cruz then switching over to Donald Trump. It's really a fascinating rendition of behind the scenes power plays among these very wealthy people, and clearly, Rebekah Mercer loses out, and we haven't heard the end of her. 

Oh, no, not at all. Thank you. 

Thank you. Thank you all for watching.
